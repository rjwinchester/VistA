 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1)  INC000000495746    Total Days Issue
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 Issues occur while trying to display the "total days" for an Incident 
 Outcome when a patient has more than 50 records in the INCIDENT OUTCOME 
 (#95) subfile in the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING (#2260) file. The issue
 occurs because the form is programmed to account for a max of 50 records
 so anything greater than 50 will display random, often extremely large,
 numeric values.
    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 ASISTS no longer limits the number of records it can process which will 
 fix the potential for erroneous data to display. 
   
 2)  INC000001036307    ASISTS - Other:
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 If editing a "Location of Injury" that has other values with all uppercase
 characters, when the data is saved, it is saved to the incorrect record.  This
 occurs because VistA sorts the records differently than ASISTS does, which
 leads to confusion during the save process.
    
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 ASISTS has been changed to no longer assume the lists are in the same order and
 evaluate the selected entry directly when identifying the record number.  This
 will ensure the correct data is saved to the correct file. 
  
 3)  INC000001046480    ASISTS - Other:
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 While determining if the Incident Report form should make the "Location
 of Injury Detail" drop down available, it tries to ensure there is 
 a value first.  The problem is, the validation code checks for more 
 than one record before making it available rather than checking for at
 least one record.  Therefore, instances where a "Location of Injury" has
 exactly one "Location of Injury Detail" item, it will not display.
    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the validation code to populate the dropdown box when more than zero
 (0) record exists.
  
  
  
 SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 =====================================
 The KIDS build is attached to this message.
  
 The ASIST GUI Executable file will need to be downloaded.  Sites might 
 also want to  download the ASISTS User Manual and ASISTS Installation 
 Guide.
  
 Sites may retrieve these files in one of the following ways:
  1.  The preferred method is to SFTP the files from:
  
     download.vista.domain.ext
  
     This will transmit the files from the first available SFTP Server.
  
  
 2.  Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
     Secure  File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
     directory at

 **************************************************************************
 NOTE: It has been determined that the install will not work with sites 
 using System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) as a method of
 distribution.  This is not a defect of ASISTS or the install file, but
 rather SCCM's inability to work with the install file because it requires
 user interaction.  Due to certain customizable options available during
 the interactive install and following the initial ASISTS Installation user
 manual, it has been determined future distributions will go out as
 previous versions have as an INTERACTIVE INSTALL so this install WILL NOT
 work at sites using SCCM.
