Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
 **NOTE: This patch is going to be released with a shorten compliance date

 allow selection of 2017 dates.

 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
 R12624959FY17  ASISTS - Dates Needed for 2017
  
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 While running the "Display Incidence Rates Worksheet" option, the "Start
 Year" and "End Year" do not allow selection of 2017 dates.  This occurs
 because the date values are hard coded and only go up to 2016. 
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Rather than using hard coded values, the ASISTS application will
 dynamically populate the dropdowns with values starting at 2004 and ending
 on the current year.
  
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ================================================== 
 Sites may retrieve the new GUI and documentation directly via Secure File 
 Transfer Protocol (SFTP). The preferred method is to SFTP the files from:
  
        download.vista.domain.ext
  
 This transmits the files from the first available SFTP server.  
  
 Sites may also elect to retrieve the file directly from the
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory from a specific server as follows:
  
   OI FIELD OFFICE          FTP ADDRESS                  DIRECTORY
   ===============          ===========                  =========
