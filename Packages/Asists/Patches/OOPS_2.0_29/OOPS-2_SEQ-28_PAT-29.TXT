Subject: ASISTS GUI 2FA IMPLEMENTATION

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch will update the log in procedure to the ASISTS Graphical User 
 Interface (GUI) to use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) which will require 
 the use of a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card.
  
 In order to make the transition to 2FA, it was also necessary to upgrade 
 the ASISTS Graphical User Interface (GUI) to Delphi version XE8 to 
 implement the new Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker allowing compliance.
  
  
 PARTICIPATING TEST SITES:
 =========================
 Carl Vinson VA Medical Center (Dublin)
 Pittsburgh HCS
   
  
 ASSOCIATED TICKET:
 ==================
 2FA
  
  
 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 The Department of Veterans Affairs Cybersecurity Task Force has been 
 tasked by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Inspector General
 (IG) to address identified material weaknesses. This task force has
 mandated that all internal, user facing VA applications become two factor
 authentication (2FA) compliant by April 30, 2017.
  
 In order to be compliant, applications are required to authenticate users 
 via Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards.  
  
 Note: Usernames and password will no longer be permitted for employees and
 contractors to access VA applications.  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The ASISTS GUI has been upgraded to Delphi XE8 to allow access to the
 latest version of the RPC Broker, implementing 2FA.
