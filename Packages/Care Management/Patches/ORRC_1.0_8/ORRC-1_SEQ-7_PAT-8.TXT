 Patch ORRC*1*8 has two software components. The software components
 consists of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) - JAVA build, Care
 Management 1.8.0, and the Veterans Health Information Systems and
 Technology Architecture (VistA) build, ORRC*1*8.   The patch 
 ORRC*1*8  ensures sure that the Care Management application can
 be launched with any version beyond JRE1.6 (32 bit).   It also
 enhances the functionality of the Care Management application by
 supporting the coexistence of the Clinician and the Nursing
 Dashboard. It addresses the issues related to JRE and saving of
 future tasks in the Clinician and the Nursing Dashboard.  It will
 synchronize the VistA server and Care Management GUI version.
  
 Also, the minimum, operational, base-line for Care Management 1.8.0
 functionality includes the installation of these VistA patches :

         tab was unexpected.
  
         Resolution: 
         -----------
         Recompiled the CM code using Java 1.6+ version and
         issue seems to resolved itself.  There is no locking/"freezing"
         behavior when running under Java 1.6+ version.

         -----------
         Recompiled the CM code using Java 1.6+ versions and issue
         seems to resolved itself. Errors are not experiences when 
         clicked on the "Go to Chart" link while running the application 
         under Java 1.6+ version (32 bit).

 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 The post-installation routine POST^ORRCY08 will run automatically.
 This routine maintains the Care Management version number (1.8.0) as 
 synchronized with the GUI version being installed as part of ORRC*1*8.  
 "Care Management Dashboard 1.8.0" will display when this post routine
 has completed properly.  There is a Client/Server Compatibility Check 
 when users start-up the Care Management GUI.  No error will display when 
 VistA patch ORRC*1*8 has installed correctly.  Routine ORRCY08 may be
 deleted after ORRC*1*8 has installed correctly; deletion of that post 
 routine will not affect Care Management 1.8.0 performance.
  
 *****Additional setup is required, please read the Care Management 
 Installation Guide.*****
 The Care Management software package requires three separate
 installation procedures: one for installing M-specific components on your
 M server, one for installing Java components on the HealtheVet 
 Desktop/Care Management  users' workstations and another for changing 
 the settings file to reflect the site's Vista connection.
