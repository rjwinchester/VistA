Subject: DD CHANGE TO FIX UNDEFINED ERROR IN FILE 633.2

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 A user has reported an undefined error in FileMan when editing the COUNTY 
 CODE field (#25) in the HBHC MEDICAL FOSTER HOME file (#633.2). This
 issue is caused by the code in the INPUT/OUTPUT TRANSFORM for this field. 
 Patch HBH*1.0*29 will update the Data Dictionary by removing the variable 
 D0 from all KILL commands preventing the error from occurring.
