Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_Prod_Overview_Guide_Groups_5_6_7.pdf) posted on the 
 Anonymous directory for installation order. This is critical for proper
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. Dates
 of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or after
 the implementation date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both systems
 also expand the number of characters allotted to seven alpha-numeric
 characters. This value does not include the decimal point, which follows
 the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no decimal point
 in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research. 
  
  
 ===============================  WARNING  ================================
  
 The ICD-10 Class I Remediation project updates VistA to include the ICD-10
 Diagnosis and Procedure codes. The first patches to be delivered by this
 project are the STS patches ICD*18.0*57 and LEX*2.0*80 which includes both
 the ICD-10 Diagnosis and Procedure codes along with new or updated APIs
 that are used by the other VistA applications to select, retrieve and
 display these new codes.
  
 There are several VistA applications that do not currently utilize code
 set versioning. Those applications are Prosthetics, Home Based Primary
 Care, and Lab Anatomic Pathology. As a result, these applications
 currently allow inactive ICD-9 codes to be displayed and selected for
 ICD-9 dates of service.
  
 During the interim, after the installation of the STS ICD-10 Class I
 Remediation patches and prior to the ICD-10 Implementation date
 (10/01/2015), these applications will also allow the display and
 selection of inactive ICD-10 codes including statuses of (Inactive) or
 (Pending). The users of these applications should use CAUTION to select
 ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes that are appropriate and active.
  
 The following examples show how the software would appear in these
 applications:
  
 EXAMPLE #1: Inactive ICD-9 codes.
 The warning (Inactive) appears at the end of the short description.
  
 PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS @ ADMISSION: 100.0// 488.1
  
 4 matches found
  
     1.  488.1     FLU DT IDEN H1N1 VIRUS (Inactive)  
     2.  488.11    FLU DT 2009 H1N1 W PNEU (Major CC)
     3.  488.12    FLU-2009 H1N1 W OTH RESP
     4.  488.19    FLU-2009 H1N1 W OTH MAN (Inactive) 
  
 Select 1-4:  
  
  
 EXAMPLE #2: Inactive ICD-10 codes.
 The warning (Pending) appears at the end of the short description.
  
 PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS @ ADMISSION: 100.0// A27.
  
 4 matches found
  
     1.  A27.0     Leptospirosis icterohemorrhagica (10/01/2015)
                   (Pending)
     2.  A27.81    Aseptic meningitis in leptospirosis (10/01/2015)
                   (Pending)
     3.  A27.89    Other forms of leptospirosis (10/01/2015) (Pending) 
     4.  A27.9     Leptospirosis, unspecified (10/01/2015) (Pending)   
  
  
 Once this patch is installed, the HBPC application now fully supports 
 ICD-9 code set versioning based on the date of interest for the record 
 being created or edited.
  
 When creating or editing records dated after the ICD-10 Activation Date
 (10/01/2015), the software correctly screens out both the inactive
 ICD-9 and inactive ICD-10 codes.
  
 ===========================  END OF WARNING  =============================
  
  
 The following functionality within the Home Based Primary Care (HBPC)
 application was updated to address the ICD-10 code set.
  
 1. Evaluation/Admission Data Entry
 Full Menu Path: HBPC Information System Menu -> Evaluation/Admission Data
 Entry
  
 The software has been updated to determine the active code set based
 on Date Of Interest, which is the Admission Date. Once the active coding
 set is determined, the software responds in one of two ways:
   
 a. If the ICD-9 code set is active, the software now fully supports ICD-9
 code set versioning. This means that only active ICD-9 codes are
 selectable based on the date of interest for the selected record.
 This includes Look-ups, searches, and displayed information.
  
 b. If the ICD-10 coding set is active, the software utilizes new
 Application Program Interfaces (APIs) to perform the Look-ups and
 searches. Because of the increased granularity of the ICD-10 code set,
 searches may return more matches than can be displayed on a single screen.
  
 For the ICD-10 active coding set, the user can enter any of the 
 following:
 i. A valid ICD-10 code.
 ii. A partial ICD-10 code.
 iii. A partial description of a valid ICD-10 code.
  
 If the user selects a valid ICD-10 code, the software continues to the
 next function.
  
 If the user selects one partial ICD-10 code (i.e., a branch node denoted
 by a trailing "-" ), all of the immediate descendants of that branch node
 are displayed to the user. This step repeats until the user selects a
 valid ICD-10 code.
  
 The example below shows the new ICD-10 search API drilling down two levels
 to select a valid ICD-10 code.
   
 Step #1: The user enters first three characters (F14) of a valid ICD-10
 code.
 Result: The software then displays the total number of entries that match
 the three character input (20), a numbered list of matching codes, their
 descriptions, and designates leaf nodes matches.
  
 Step #2: The user reviews the list and selects entry #4 (F14.15-) which is
 a branch node.
 Result: The software then displays the total number of entries that match
 the partial ICD-10 code F14.15, a numbered list of matching code(s), their
 descriptions, and whether the entry is a branch (-) or a leaf node. In
 this example, there are three matches and all three of them are valid
 ICD-10 codes (no "-" at the end of the code).
  
 Step #3: The user reviews the list and selects entry #2 (F14.151), which
 is a valid ICD-10 code.
 Result: The software displays the valid ICD-10 code as well as the code's
 full description on the next line.
  
 ICD-10 Diagnosis code: F14 <enter>
  
 20 matches found
  
    1.  F14.10    Cocaine Abuse, Uncomplicated
    2.  F14.12-   Cocaine abuse with intoxication
    3.  F14.14    Cocaine Abuse with Cocaine-Induced Mood Disorder
    4.  F14.15-   Cocaine abuse with cocaine-induced psychotic disorder
    5.  F14.18-   Cocaine abuse with other cocaine-induced disorder
    6.  F14.19    Cocaine Abuse with unspecified Cocaine-Induced Disorder
    7.  F14.20    Cocaine Dependence, Uncomplicated
    8.  F14.21    Cocaine Dependence, in Remission
  
 Press <RETURN> for more, "^" to exit, or Select 1-8:  4 <enter>
  
 3 matches found
  
    1.  F14.150   Cocaine Abuse with Cocaine-Induced Psychotic
                  Disorder with Delusions (ICD-10-CM F14.150)
    2.  F14.151   Cocaine Abuse with Cocaine-Induced Psychotic
                  Disorder with Hallucinations (ICD-10-CM F14.151)
    3.  F14.159   Cocaine Abuse with Cocaine-Induced Psychotic
                  Disorder, unspecified (ICD-10-CM F14.159)
  
 Select 1-3:  2 <enter>
  
 ICD-10 Diagnosis code: F14.151
 ICD-10 Diagnosis description: Cocaine Abuse with Cocaine-Induced Psychotic
 Disorder with Hallucinations (ICD-10-CM F14.151)
  
 If Admission date is updated such that the new active coding set is 
 different than the previously entered Primary Diagnosis @ Admission's 
 coding set, then the Primary Diagnosis will be deleted.
  
  
 2. Discharge Data Entry
 Full Menu Path: HBPC Information System Menu -> Discharge Data Entry
  
 The software has been updated to determine the active coding set based
 on Date Of Interest, which is the Discharge Date. Once the active coding
 set is determined, the software will respond in one of two ways:
  
 a. If the ICD-9 code set is active, the software now fully supports
 ICD-9 code set versioning. This means that only active ICD-9 codes are
 selectable based on the date of interest for the selected record. This
 includes Look-ups, searches, and displayed information.
  
 b. If the ICD-10 coding set is active, the software utilizes new
 Application Program Interfaces (APIs) to perform the Look-ups and
 searches. Because of the increased granularity of the ICD-10 code set,
 searches may return more matches than can be displayed on a single screen.
  
 If the coding set of the Primary Diagnosis @ Admission is different from
 the coding set of the Primary Diagnosis @ Discharge then the Primary
 Diagnosis @ Admission are not defaulted for the Primary Diagnosis @
 Discharge.
  
 If the Discharge Date is updated such that the code set based on the new
 Discharge Date is different from the code set of the previous Discharge 
 Date, the Primary Diagnosis @ Discharge are deleted.
  
  
 3. Edit Form Errors Data
 Full Menu Path: HBPC Information System Menu -> Transmission Menu ... -> 
 Edit Form Errors Data
  
 The software has been updated to determine the active coding set based
 on Date Of Interest, which is the Discharge Date. Once the active coding
 set is determined, the software responds in one of two ways:
  
 a. If the ICD-9 code set is active, the software now fully supports
 ICD-9 code set versioning. This means that only active ICD-9 codes are
 selectable based on the date of interest for the selected record. This
 includes Look-ups, searches, and displayed information.
  
 b. If the ICD-10 coding set is active, the software utilizes new
 Application Program Interfaces (APIs) to perform the Look-ups and
 searches. Because of the increased granularity of the ICD-10 code set,
 searches may return more matches than can be displayed on a single screen.
  
 If the coding set of the Primary Diagnosis @ Admission is different from
 the coding set of the Primary Diagnosis @ Discharge then the Primary
 Diagnosis @ Admission are not defaulted for the Primary Diagnosis @
 Discharge.
  
 If the Discharge Date is updated such that the code set based on the new
 Discharge Date is different from the code set of the previous Discharge 
 Date, the Primary Diagnosis @ Discharge are deleted.
  
  
 4. The following Menu Options have been updated to show "ICD" text in the
 title and/or description:
 a. Reports Menu
 b. ICD Code/Dx Text by Date Range Report  (80)
 c. Admissions/Discharges by Date Range Report  (132)
 d. Census Reports Menu
 e. Active Census with ICD Code/Text Report  (132)
 f. Form Errors Report  (80)
  
  
 5. The following reports have been modified:
 a. Evaluation/Admission Data Report by Patient  (80)
 Primary Diagnosis @ Adm field value now can show either ICD-9 or ICD-10
 code based on active coding set on the Admission date.
  
 b. Discharge Data Report by Patient  (80)
 Primary Diagnosis @ D/C field value now can show either ICD-9 or ICD-10
 code based on the active coding set on the Discharge date.
  
 c. Admissions/Discharges by Date Range Report  (132)
 If report date range is prior to ICD-10 implementation date then column 
 header for ICD code states "ICD-9 Code". If the date range is after ICD-10
 implementation date then column header states "ICD-10 Code". If date range
 includes ICD-10 implementation date then column header states "ICD Code".
  
 d. Patient Visit Data Report  (80)
 Report shows either ICD-9 or ICD-10 code with description in the visit 
 data.
  
 e. Visit Data by Date Range Report  (80)
 Report shows either ICD-9 or ICD-10 code with description in the visit 
 data.
  
 f. ICD Code/Dx Text by Date Range Report  (80)
 If report date range is prior to ICD-10 implementation date then column 
 header for ICD information states "ICD-9 Code/Diagnosis Text". If the date
 range is after ICD-10 implementation date then column header states 
 "ICD-10 Code/Diagnosis Text". If date range includes ICD-10 implementation
 date then column header states "ICD Code/Diagnosis Text".
 If user does not wish to include all the ICD Diagnosis codes then "Select 
 ICD Diagnosis:" prompt asks for ICD-9 codes if date range is before 
 ICD-10 implementation date. The same prompt asks for ICD-10 codes if date 
 range is after the ICD-10 implementation date. If date range includes 
 ICD-10 implementation date then prompt inputs both ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes.
  
 g. Active Census with ICD Code/Text Report  (132)
 If report date range is prior to ICD-10 implementation date then column 
 header for ICD code states "ICD-9 Code". If the date range is after ICD-10
 implementation date then column header states "ICD-10 Code". If date range
 includes ICD-10 implementation date then column header states "ICD Code".
  
 h. Form Errors Report  (80)
 This report has been updated to show either ICD-9 or ICD-10 code with 
 description in the visit data.
