Subject: PCMM - PATIENT MULTI ASSIGNMENT BY SELECTED CLINIC

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address several inconsistencies in a list of patients
 selected and displayed as available ones for multi assignment by 
 appointment in a clinic. That list of patients is available in PCMM GUI.
 Additionally this patch will address a problem with incorrect indication 
 of the patient Primary Care assignment if a hanging cross-reference in 
 the Patient Team Position Assignment file (# 404.43) is evaluated as a 
 valid one.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1) HD0000000362573 - GUI Multiple Patient Assignment question
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When a user unassigns a patient in the PCMM GUI then attempts to make a 
 multi-assignment, using the same patient, the system does not make the 
 patient available for new assignment to the original position if the 
 assignment occurs during the same month as the unassignment.
  
 This issue is produced by selecting the following options in PCMM GUI 
 once the initial unassignment has been made:
  
 - Select Patient/Multiple Assignments/Position Assignment
 - Select a Team
 - Select a Position
 - Select Patients by Appointments
 - Select by Clinic
 - Select Get List by date range (a patient list available for a new 
   assignment will be displayed)
 - Select Include All (Patients are then moved over to new assignments;
   next the user selects 'Save' to save the current assignments.)
  
 Patients selected for the assignment following the above criteria are 
 matched against exceptions that represent patients with assignment dates 
 for the indicated Position. Those exceptions might include patients that 
 were already unassigned from the position to be assigned again, which
 eliminates them from a selection for a new assignment.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Routine SCMCBK has been modified to perform an additional search of 
 previously generated exceptions to include patients that are available 
 for assignment and have been unassigned from that particular Position.  
 An expected patient will now be available in the multi-assignment list 
 scenario as described in the problem section.
   
 2) HD0000000372116 - Patients available for multi assignment should be in
                      no assignment status for any PC position.
  
 Problem:
 ========
 A list of patients displayed as being available for assignment, might 
 include patients that are already assigned to other Primary Care teams.  
 Those patients can also be selected; however, they would not be assigned 
 to the selected Position.  The problem is that those patients are being 
 displayed as available for assignment but they shouldn't be.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Routine SCMCBK has been modified so when the final selection of the 
 patient list is reviewed and finds patients that are assigned to a 
 different Primary Care team; those patients are eliminated from the list 
 and will no longer be displayed for Primary Care team assignment.
  
  
 3) HD0000000372120 - If patients are selected for multi assignment by
                      appointments for a clinic then only kept appointments
                      should be counted.
 Problem:
 ========
 When patients are selected for assignment following the criteria as 
 described in Problem 1, appointments that are not 'kept' (for example:  
 "No-Show" appointments and future appointments) are included in the list.
 The problem is that those patients who do not have any 'kept' appointments
 are available for selection.  If patients are selected for
 multi-assignment by appointments for a clinic then only 'kept'
 appointments should be counted.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Routine SCAPMC28 has been modified to eliminate appointments that do not 
 have a pointer to the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file (#409.68).  Appointments 
 identified by the scheduling API: SDAPI^SDAMA301 will include 
 appointments in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER field (#21) of the APPOINTMENT 
 multiple sub-file (#2.98) in the PATIENT file (#2).  
  
  
 4) HD00000000383775 - Site cannot assign a patient to a PC role
  
 Problem:
 ========
 A site reported that a user could not assign a patient to a Primary Care 
 Position because a window with the date to be assigned, displays an 
 option to assign a Primary Care as unavailable for selection; despite the 
 fact that the patient is not assigned to any Primary Care Position.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Routines SCAPMCU2 and SCMCTPU2 have been modified to delete a hanging 
 cross-reference and to provide a proper identification of patients for 
 Primary Care assignments.
  
 Technical:
 ==========
 The function "GETPCTP" of routine SCAPMCU2 and the function "CHKROLE" of 
 routine SCMCTPU2 are called to determine the patient assignment status 
 regarding the Primary Care Team and Position. Information returned by 
 those API's is incorrect if the related code encounters APCPOS 
 cross-reference in the PATIENT TEAM POSITION ASSIGNMENT file (# 404.43) 
 that points to non-existing entry in that file. An existing $G function 
 interprets the missing entry as an existing one and returns a pointer to
 the Primary Care team.
