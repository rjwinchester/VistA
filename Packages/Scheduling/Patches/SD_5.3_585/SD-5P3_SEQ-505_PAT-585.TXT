Subject: OUT OF SYNC ISSUES AND 8100 ERROR CODE ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix the following issues with locally created codes in the
 ELIGIBILITY CODE file (#8):
  
    - OUT OF SYNC problem when making an appointment,
    - OUT OF SYNC problem when adding a patient to the wait list,
    - Ambulatory Care Nightly Transmission generating reject errors due to
      software not recognizing local eligibility codes having an Internal
      Entry Number (IEN) greater than 99.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) HD0000000135595 - OUT OF SYNC problem when making an appointment
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Sites are permitted to create local eligibility codes via Registration
    menu option Eligibility Code Enter/Edit [DG ELIG CODE ENTER/EDIT].
    These codes are maintained in the ELIGIBILITY CODE file (#8) and also
    stored in the Primary Eligibility Code field (#.361) of the PATIENT
    file (#2) for the patient. When a local eligibility code is created,
    the user must specify the MAS eligibility code, from the MAS 
    ELIGIBILITY file (#8.1), that the local code will point to. The local
    eligibility code can only be linked to one MAS eligibility code, which
    is stored in the MAS Eligibility Code field (#8) of the ELIGIBILITY
    CODE file (#8). A check is then made to ensure the patient's Service 
    Connected Percentage, Service Connected designation and Primary Eligibility 
    Code are in sync. The Scheduling software uses the MAS ELIGIBILITY CODE 
    file (#8.1), which cannot be locally modified, when checking the primary
    eligibility. If a locally created eligibility code (from file #8)
    is returned by the Registration API, Scheduling does not recognize it
    and presents the OUT OF SYNC warning message. Additionally, the user is 
    not presented with the prompt - "Is This Appointment for a Service          
    Connected Condition?".
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDM4 will be modified to extract the MAS Eligibility Code for
    the patient before checking to see if the patient's eligibility
    records are out of sync. This will insure the OUT OF SYNC warning
    message only displays when applicable and that the user will
    appropriately receive the prompt - "Is This Appointment for a Service
    Connected Condition?".
  
 2) HD0000000492324 - OUT OF SYNC problem when adding patient to Wait List
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Sites are permitted to create local Eligibility Codes via Registration
    menu option Eligibility Code Enter/Edit [DG ELIG CODE ENTER/EDIT].
    These codes are maintained in the ELIGIBILITY CODE file (#8) and also
    stored in the Primary Eligibility Code field (#.361) of the PATIENT
    file (#2) for the patient.  When adding a patient to the Electronic 
    Wait List the software calls a Registration API to retrieve the
    patient's primary eligibility.  A check is then made to insure the
    patient's Service Connected Percentage, Service Connected designation 
    and Primary Eligibility Code are in sync. The Electronic Wait 
    List software uses the MAS ELIGIBILITY CODE file (#8.1), which cannot be
    locally modified, when checking the primary eligibility. If a
    locally created eligibility code (from file #8) is returned by the
    Registration API, the Electronic Wait List does not recognize it and
    presents the OUT OF SYNC warning message.  Additionally, the user
    is not presented with the prompt - "Is This Appointment for a Service       
    Connected Condition? (Y or N)?".
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDWLSC will be modified to extract the MAS Eligibility Code for
    the patient before checking to see if the patient's eligibility
    records are out of sync.  This will insure the OUT OF SYNC warning
    message only displays when applicable and that the user will
    appropriately receive the prompt - "Is This Appointment for a Service
    Connected Condition?(Y or N)?".
  
 3) HD0000000582622 - IEMM issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Ambulatory Care Nightly Transmission process calls API MTI^SCDXUTLO
    to calculate the patient's Means Test Indicator, passing in several
    input parameters, including the Internal Entry Number (IEN) for the
    patient's primary eligibility from the ELIGIBILITY CODE file (#8).  If
    the value of the IEN that is passed in is greater than 99, it generates
    as 8100 reject error (invalid Means Test Indicator), which places the
    outpatient encounter on the Incomplete Encounter Management (IEMM)
    Error report [SCENI IEMM ERROR REPORT]. In some cases, an IEN
    greater than 99 may be valid and therefore, should not reject the
    outpatient encounter and generate an 8100 reject error.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SCDXUTL0 will be modified to verify the eligibility code being
    passed in is valid, rather than checking the value of the IEN that is
    passed in.  This will allow the software to correctly calculate the
    patient's Means Test Indicator and only generate 8100 reject errors 
    when applicable.
