 1. I18373344FY18 - CORRECT ERROR IN SDRR PRINT CARDS BY TEAM
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When selecting 'Print Cards by Team' from the Clinic Recall Print  
    Menu [SDRR PRINT MENU] option, if any patients on the team have a   
    bad address, the error <UNDEFINED>DQT+1^SDRRRECP is received.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDRRRECP was modified to remove the extra line of code 
    'D ^%ZISC G QUIT' at line DQT+19^SDRRRECP.
  
 2. INC0250508 - CLASS I RECALL LETTERS DO NOT INDENT FIRST LINE OF 
                 CONFIDENTIAL ADDRESS
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When printing recall letters or cards, the starting position for the
    first line of a patient's confidential address is not aligned with 
    other lines of the address.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines SDRRTSK, SDRRTSK1, SDRRRECL, and SDRRRECP were modified to
    change the starting position of the first line of a patient's 
    confidential address from position 12 to 20 to match with other address
    lines.
