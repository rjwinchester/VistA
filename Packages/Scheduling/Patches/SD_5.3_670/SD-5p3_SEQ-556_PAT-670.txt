Description:
============

 it does not print any data.

 CA NSD Ticket Overview:
 ======================
 1. I13415844FY17 - Transmission history report issue  
  
   
    Problem:
    -------
    The Transmission History Report - Full [SCDX AMBCAR XMIT HIST FULL] 
    report does not print data when the output is sent to MailMan
    (P-MESSAGE) or a file/printer. The report's output is only viewable
    on the screen. The mail message or report will show "No Data Printed"  
    even though data will print to the screen.
  
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Routine SCDXPRN2 was modified to prevent premature killing of the sort 
    data when the print job was spooled to a remote device.
  
    Two subsequent issues were identified once the report, Transmission
    History Report - Full [SCDX AMBCAR XMIT HIST FULL], was able to print.
   
    Issue one appears to be a collision of requirements for page length
    between ^%ZIS print jobs and EN1^DIP print jobs. This causes many
    blank lines to be included at the bottom of each page of a report and
    in some cases can be extremely large. The issue is being referred to
    the FileMan team with ticket number R16063614FY17 as a global fix for
    reports across all applications. As a temporary fix this report,
    Transmission History Report - Full [SCDX AMBCAR XMIT HIST FULL], will
    print in browser mode with the page breaks suppressed.
   
    Issue two appears in network multi-machine configurations. The 
    original report is using ^TMP with the $J job address variable to
    uniquely identify the sort global. The $J value changes when the job
    is sent to another machine and the sort is lost. This is aggravated by
    the fact that ^TMP globals are not translatable across network nodes,
    so the sort global was changed to ^XTMP and uses the users DUZ number
    for the unique identifier. This allows the job to print in production
    environments where it was failing. This issue does not seem to show in
    test environments, as they aren't usually configured in this manner.
  
 Technical:
 =========
    Routine SCDXPRN2 has been modified to set variable DIOEND to "K
    ^TMP(""SCDXPRN2"",$J)". Previously EN1^DIP would only kill the sort
    node so the PRINT tag of SCDXPRN2 would follow with a kill to finish
    the cleanup. This kill was killing the sort global before %ZIS could
    spool it to the output. This change for the DIOEND variable makes it
    possible to remove the extra kill, so line PRINT+44^SCDXPRN2  was
    commented out (K @SCDXGLO).
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours. Users should not be 
 calling the Transmission History Report - Full  [SCDX AMBCAR XMIT HIST 
 FULL] while install is in progress.
   
 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.

        a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
           is installed.
        c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
           the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
        d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
           the components of the KIDS build.
  
     4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
