Version : 5.3       SEQ #541                    Status: Released

Subject: EMERGENCY STOP CODE UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 SD*5.3*661 adds four new Stop Codes to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file as 
 requested by the Office of Finance, Managerial Cost Accounting Office 
 (MCAO).
  
 The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) of 2016 directs the 
 Department of Veterans Affairs to expand its opioid safety initiative to 
 include all VA medical facilities.  CARA exempts Veterans from paying a 
 copayment to the VA for education on opioid safety to include overdose 
 prevention and treatment for overdose.  In order to schedule, track and 
 exempt from copayments these opioid education visits, designated clinics
 must be established.  An emergency Stop Code patch is required to 
 implement these clinics by March 15, 2017.
  
  
                          *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 **************************************************************************
 *  This patch is being released with a compliance date of March 15, 2017 *
 *  and should be installed as close to Close of Business (COB) on        *
 *  March 14, 2017 as possible, but not after March 15, 2017.  Early      *
 *  installation of this patch could result in transmission of incorrect  *
 *  Stop Codes that will result in errors from Austin.  Coordination with *
 *  the MAS (Medical Administration Service) PAS (Program Application     *
 *  Specialist)/ADPAC (Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator) *
 *  is imperative as SD*5.3*661 will cause changes to the CLINIC STOP     *
 *  (#40.7) file.  Testing can be done in a site's mirror account before  *
 *  installation in production to verify changes.  Please keep in mind    *
 *  that new Stop Codes should not be assigned in MAS/Scheduling until    *
 *  March 15, 2017 as the PCE encounters bearing these Stop Codes will    *
 *  not be accepted in Austin until that date.  DO NOT make changes to    *
 *  existing clinics, new clinics should be built with the new Stop Codes.*

 Instructions for the Emergency Stop Code Patch:
  
 SD*5.3*661 makes additions and changes to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file 
 as of March 15, 2017.  No clinic can be created using any new Stop Codes
 contained in the patch until after this patch is implemented.
  
 MCA Site Teams, Scheduling and IRM should coordinate to perform the 
 following sequence:
  
 1. From the menu, Setup for DSS Clinic Information [ECX SETUP CLINIC], 
    run the DSS worksheet Option 2:  Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File 
    [ECXSCLOAD] to run after the close of business of March 31, 2017. 
    Then, make any necessary adjustments before approval so all clinics 
    on the worksheet have setups applicable for the month of March 2017.
  
 2. IRM installs the patch late on March 14 or early on March 15, 2017.
  
 3. Scheduling staff:  Make new clinics in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44)
    file by creating new clinics with the new Stop Codes for March 15, 
    2017 clinic appointments.
  
 4. MCA staff: DO NOT make changes using Option 4:  Enter/Edit Clinic
    Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] for the CLINICS AND STOP CODES (#728.44) file 
    until preparing to run the March extract.
  
    Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract for March 2017.
    Do not edit clinic changes for April Stop Code changes with 
    Option 4:  Enter/Edit Clinic Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] option prior to
    running the March CLI Extract.  It is the edit, not the "approve",
    that changes the values included in the extract.  Perform normal
    AUDITS for the CLI Extract.
  
 5. After auditing and receiving confirmation of successful deblocking of
    the transmitted March CLI Extract, proceed with Stop Code changes to
    the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes Worksheet clinics for April.
