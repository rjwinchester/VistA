Description:
============

 This patch provides Fiscal Year 2015 Mid-Year updates to the CLINIC 
 STOP file (#40.7) as requested by the Office of Finance, Managerial 
 Cost Accounting Office (MCAO).
  
                           *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 **************************************************************************
 ** This patch is being released with a compliance date of April 1, 2015.**
 ** This patch should be installed as close to Close of Business (COB)   **
 ** March 31, 2015 as possible but not after April 1, 2015. Early        **
 ** installation of this patch could result in transmission of incorrect **
 ** stop codes that will result in errors from Austin. Coordination with **
 ** the MAS (Medical Administration Service) PAS (Program Application    **
 ** Specialist)/ADPAC (Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator)**
 ** is imperative as the patch will cause changes to the CLINIC STOP file**
 ** (#40.7). Testing can be done in a site's mirror account before       **
 ** installation in production to verify changes. This patch inactivates **
 ** and creates stop codes effective April 1, 2015; therefore installing **
 ** early may modify certain stop codes that may currently be in use at  **
 ** your site. It is advised that clinics with stop codes assigned that  **
 ** will incur restriction date/type changes should be corrected as soon **
 ** as possible after installation. Please keep in mind that new stop    **
 ** code corrections should not be assigned until April 1, 2015 as they  **
 ** will not be accepted in Austin until that date. All other stop code  **
 ** corrections should be made as early as possible on April 1, 2015.    **

 MCA (Managerial Cost Accounting) Sites Team Instructions for 
               FY15 Mid-Year Stop Code Patch
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 This patch makes additions and changes to the CLINIC STOP file (#40.7) as 
 of April 1, 2015.
  
   - No Clinic can be created using any new stop codes contained in the 
     patch until after this patch is implemented.
  
   - Any clinics using a stop code inactivated by the patch should have
     an active stop code assigned. Assigning appropriate active stop codes
     to clinics can be accomplished prior to patch implementation if 
     desired.
  
 MCA Site Teams, Scheduling, and IRM (Information Resource Management) 
 should coordinate to perform the following sequence:
  
   1. Run the DSS worksheet option Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File 
      [ECXSCLOAD]. Then, make any necessary adjustments before approval so
      all clinics on the worksheet have setups applicable for the month of
      March 2015.
  
   2. IRM installs the patch late on March 31 or early on April 1, 2015.
  
   3. Run the Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report [SD CLN STOP CODE 
      REP] to list those clinics that need changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION
      file (#44) for FY15 Mid-Year. Work with Scheduling staff to make 
      changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) so that the clinics will
      have the correct stop codes in place for April 1st clinic appoint-
      ments. DO NOT make changes using Enter/Edit DSS Stop Codes for 
      Clinics [ECXSCEDIT] for the CLINICS AND STOP CODES file (#728.44) at
      this time.
  
   4. Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract for March 2015.
      Updates should not be made for April stop code changes with the
      Enter/Edit DSS Stop Codes for Clinics [ECXSCEDIT] option prior to
      running the March CLI Extract. Perform normal AUDITS for the CLI
      Extract.
  
   5. After auditing the March CLI Extract proceed with FY15 Mid-Year Stop
      Code changes to the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes Worksheet clinics:
  
      a. Run the Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File [ECXSCLOAD] option. This
         option creates local entries in the CLINICS AND STOP CODE file
         (#728.44) and compares this file to the HOSPITAL LOCATION file 
         (#44) to see if there are any differences since the last time the
         file was reviewed.
  
      b. Use the option Clinics and DSS Stop Codes Print [ECXSCLIST]. This
         option produces a worksheet of (A) All Clinics, (C) Active, (D) 
         Duplicate, (I) Inactive, or only the (U) Unreviewed Clinics that
         are awaiting approval.
  
      c. Update for FY15 Mid-Year as needed using the Enter/Edit DSS Stop
         Codes for Clinics [ECXSCEDIT] option.
  
      d. Approve changes using the Approve Reviewed DSS Clinic Worksheet
         [ECXSCAPPROV] option. Finalize all stop code changes on the work-
         sheet to be ready to run the April DSS CLI Extract.
