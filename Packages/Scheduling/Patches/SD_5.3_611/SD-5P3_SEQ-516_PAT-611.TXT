Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses four Electronic Wait List [EWL] issues:
  
 1. Clinics with an inactive date in the SD WL CLINIC LOCATION file (#409.32)
    can create wait list entries when using the MAKE APPOINTMENT [SDAM APPT
    MAKE] protocol.
  
 2. Undefined error occurring when creating an entry using the ENTER/EDIT 
    WAIT LIST (Sch/PCMM) [SD WAIT LIST ENTER/EDIT].
  
 3. When using the INQUIRE WAIT LIST (Sch/PCMM) [SD WAIT LIST INQUIRY] option 
    user is prompted to select an entry to view but all entries are displayed.
  
 4. When using the Enrollment Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Statistic Report [SD 
    WAIT LIST ENROLL REPORT] option there is a calculation error in the 
    DO NOT REMOVE DATE COLUMN.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC000000884012 - Scheduling - EWL
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Clinics with an inactive date in the SD WL CLINIC LOCATION file (#409.32)
 are still allowed to create wait list entries using the MAKE APPOINTMENT
 [SDAM APPT MAKE] protocol.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SDM1 and SDM2A will be modified by implementing a check for a date
 in the DATE INACTIVATED (#3) field of the SD WL CLINIC LOCATION (#409.32)
 file. If the clinic has an inactive date there will be no prompt to add
 that patient to the wait list when scheduling a next available
 appointment.  
  
  
 2. INC000000349070 - EN+6^SDWLE113 *SDWLDA - CLOSE MULTI EWL ENTRIES IF
                      ASSIGNED TO PCMM TEAM
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When creating an entry using the ENTER/EDIT WAIT LIST (Sch/PCMM)
 [SD WAIT LIST ENTER/EDIT] option using the PCMM TEAM ASSIGNMENT wait list
 type an undefined error occurs.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SDWLRP1 will be modified to prevent an undefined error from 
 occurring by stopping variables SDWLDA,SDWLDUZ, and SDWLDFN from being
 killed before the exit logic.
  
  
 3. INC000000278191 - Inquire Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Display 
                                                                            
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the INQUIRE WAIT LIST (Sch/PCMM) [SD WAIT LIST INQUIRY] option
 the user is prompted to select an entry to view but all entries are
 displayed.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SDWLI will be modified to use the PATIENT (#2) file instead of the 
 SD WAIT LIST (#409.3) file to obtain the patient IEN (Internal Entry 
 Number) so that the prompt to select entry will not occur. This change
 will mimic the functionality of the WAIT LIST DISPLAY [SD WAIT LIST
 DISPLAY] protocol in the APPOINTMENT MANAGEMENT [SDAM APPT MGT] option.
  
  
 4. INC000001001617 - Scheduling - EWL:
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the Enrollment Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Statistic Report [SD WAIT
 LIST ENROLL REPORT] option there is a calculation error in the DO NOT
 REMOVE DATE COLUMN.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SDWLROIS will be modified by fixing the line of code that sets
 conditions for whether a record is calculated into the DO NOT REMOVE DATE
 COLUMN of the Enrollment Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Statistic Report [SD WAIT 
 LIST ENROLL REPORT].
