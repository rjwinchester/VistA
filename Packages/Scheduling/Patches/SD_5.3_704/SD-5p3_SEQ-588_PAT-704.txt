 Tele Health Management Platform (TMP) is implementing processes that will
 keep Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture 
 (VistA) clinic and appointment data for tele health clinics and
 appointments in sync with the TMP application. These real time updates 
 are triggered when appointments are made or cancelled in a clinic
 that has a stop code or credit stop code that is associated with tele
 health. 
  
 Real-time clinic updates are triggered when a new tele health clinic is
 added at a medical center or if the stop code, credit stop code, clinic 
 name, treating specialty, service, or overbooks allowed fields are
 edited. A real-time clinic update is also triggered if a tele health
 clinic is inactivated or if an inactive tele health clinic is 
 reactivated. Tele health clinics are identified by stop code or credit 
 stop codes.
  
 The current Get Consults (ORQQCN LIST) Remote Procedure Call (RPC) 
 doesn't return the Clinically Indicated Date (CID) when the consults are
 returned to the calling application. TMP is replacing the call to the RPC
 with an HL7 query/response message. The new process returns a list of the
 patient's consults over the last two years and includes the CID field with
 the data if it is available. Displaying the CID with the consult in TMP
 provides the scheduler with the information needed to schedule an
 appointment for the consults within the 30 day window after the CID.
  
 If end users/customers need TMP technical support during Go Live or 
 anytime thereafter, they can reach out to the National Telehealth 
 Technology Help Desk (NTTHD) at 866-651-3180 or via email at 
 VHA_NTTHD@domain.ext.

 TMP is adding two new indices to the PATIENT File (#2), the APPOINTMENT 
 Multiple field (#2.98). These new indices will trigger an update to be
 sent to TMP when an appointment is made or cancelled.
  
 TMP is adding one new index on the HOSPITAL LOCATION File (#44) on the 
 fields list below. This new index triggers an update to TMP when one or 
 more of these fields are edited.

 Patch Back out Instructions:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.  No
 data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no rollback
 strategy is required.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed-up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 After installing the backed-up routines, the site will need to use the 
 HL7/HLO options to edit the HL Logical Links and either delete these 
 entries or delete the IP and Port information.
  
 The site will need to use FileMan to delete the new indices on the 
 Patient File (#2), Appointment Multiple field (#2.98) and to delete the
 new index on the Hospital Location File (#44). These new indices are 
 triggers that cause HL7 messages to be sent out of VistA to the TMP 
 application. If this patch is backed out, these new indices need to be 
 deleted to prevent the triggers from firing and creating the HL7 
 messages.
  
 The other database changes do not need to be deleted as they do not 
 impact any code or other functionality.
