Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide posted on the 
 Anonymous directory for installation order. This is critical for proper 
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software. 
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the implementation date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
 systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
 which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research. 
  
 The following functionality within the Ambulatory Care Reporting (ACR)
 application was updated to address the ICD-10 code set.
  
 1. ACRP Ad Hoc Report [SCRPW AD HOC REPORT] 
    -  If entering diagnoses for the Report Perspective, users are 
       required to first select either the ICD-9 or ICD-10 code set. 
       Selectable diagnoses are then restricted to the selected code 
       set, the default of which is I9.
  
    -  In Report Limitations, the system prohibits date ranges that span
       the ICD-10 implementation date. Date ranges must occur entirely before 
       the implementation date, or entirely on/after the implementation date.
  
    -  If entering diagnoses for the Report Limitations, selectable diagnoses
       are restricted to the code set that is valid for the given report 
       date range.
  
    -  Prior to the execution of the report, the system validates that all
       selected diagnoses within the Report Perspective and Report Limitations 
       are of the correct code set for the selected report date range. Users
       are required to correct any discrepancies before the report can be 
       run. Below is an example of a message the user may see. 
          The Report Limitation dates must be on or after OCT 1,2014 to match
            the (ICD-10-CM) diagnoses specified in the Report Perspective.
          Unable to continue with queuing!
  
    -  All visual displays of diagnosis descriptions have the ability to
       wrap text to account for longer descriptions in the ICD-10 code set.
  
  2. Most Frequent 50 IP ICD Diagnosis Codes (IP7) [SCRPW DVM IP DX FREQUENCY] 
     and 
     Most Frequent 50 ICD Diagnosis Codes (OP7) [SCRPW DVM DX FREQUENCY]
            
     - All instances of 'ICD-9-CM' in displayed text have been changed to 
       'ICD Diagnosis'.
  
     - All visual displays of diagnosis descriptions have the ability to
       wrap text to account for longer descriptions in the ICD-10 code set.
  
 3. Encounter Activity Report [SCRPW ENCOUNTER ACTIVITY RPT] and
    Outpatient Diagnosis/Procedure Frequency Report [SCRPW DX/CPT 
    FREQUENCY REPORT]
  
    - The system prohibits date ranges that span the ICD-10 implementation 
      date. Date ranges must occur entirely before the implementation date, or 
      entirely on/after the implementation date.
  
    - All visual displays of diagnosis descriptions have the ability to
      wrap text to account for longer descriptions in the ICD-10 code set.
  
 4. Outpatient Diagnosis/Procedure Code Search [SCRPW DX/PROCEDURE CODE 
    SEARCH]
  
    - The system prohibits date ranges that span the ICD-10
      implementation date. Date ranges must occur entirely before the
      implementation date, or entirely on/after the implementation date.
  
    - Selectable diagnoses are restricted to the code set that is valid 
      for the given report date range.
  
    - All visual displays of diagnosis descriptions have the ability to
      wrap text to account for longer descriptions in the ICD-10 code set.
  
 5. Encounter 'Action Required' Report [SCRPW ACTION REQUIRED REPORT]
  
    - The system supports both ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes and process
      transmission error codes correctly for both code sets.
  
 6. Ambulatory Care Nightly Transmission to NPCDB [SCDX AMBCAR NIGHTLY XMIT]
  
    - The system supports both ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes and transmits
      code set identifiers of 'I9' and 'I10' respectively within the DG1-2
      segment-field of outgoing HL7 messages.
  
    - The system supports the longer 60 character short descriptions for
      ICD-10 codes, and transmits all 60 characters in the DG1-4 segment-
      field of outgoing HL7 messages.
