  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 This patch adds consistency checks for DIRECT PATIENT SCHEDULING? field 
 (#61) and DISPLAY CLIN APPT TO PATIENTS? field (#62) in the HOSPITAL 
 LOCATION file (#44) when creating a new clinic or editing an existing 
 clinic by using the Set up a Clinic [SDBUILD] menu option.
  
 This effort was requested by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 
 Access and Clinic Administration Program (ACAP) in support of the VistA 
 Scheduling Enhancements (VSE) project.
  
 Additional changes added to fix hard error when calling Wait List or 
 Recall Reminder whenever the help text for Select LANGUAGE DATE/TIME: 
 prompt invoked while executing the Make Appointment action [MA  Make 
 Appointment] in Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT].

 CA Ticket Overview:
 =================== 
 1. R7372939FY16 - ADDING CHKS FOR FLDS #61 AND #62 IN FILE #44
  
  
  Problem:
  --------
  This is a request for additional data integrity checks for fields 
  added by patch SD*5.3*635. In addition, the input template for Clinic
  Definition needs to enforce the following business rules:
  DISPLAY CLIN APPT TO PATIENTS? (#62)  MUST be set to YES if 
  DIRECT PATIENT SCHEDULING=YES (#61)
  DISPLAY CLIN APPT TO PATIENTS? (#62)  MAY NOT be set to NO if 
  DIRECT PATIENT SCHEDULING= YES (#61)
  
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
 DIRECT PATIENT SCHEDULING? field (#61) and DISPLAY CLIN APPT TO PATIENTS?
 field (#62) in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) were updated to require
 field DISPLAY CLIN APPT TO PATIENTS? (#62) to be yes if field DIRECT
 PATIENT SCHEDULING? (#61) is yes. Input Template SDB changed to enforce
 these rules.
  
  
  DIRECT PATIENT SCHEDULING field (#61) input will prompt for Direct
  patient scheduling. If "NO" is entered it will go to Display Clin Appt to
  Patients prompt.  If "Yes" is entered it will skip to the Service prompt
  and set both DIRECT PATIENT SCHEDULING? field (#61) and DISPLAY
  CLIN APPT TO PATIENTS? field (#62) to "YES"
  
 2. I13596655FY17 - Error trap: $ZE= <UNDEFINED>N5+16^DICN0 *DA(1)
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When trying to add Recall Reminder to patient, the DO variable was 
  initialized and the value was causing FILE^DICN to error out with
  $ZE=<UNDEFINED>N5+16^DICN0 *DA(1.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  NEW+1^SDRR1 was changed to add the variable DO to its kill list.
  
 3. R14038622FY17 vista: Error when adding a patient to the waiting 
 list... 
  
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When trying to add patient to Waiting List, the DO variable was 
  initialized and the value was causing FILE^DICN to error out with
  $ZE=<UNDEFINED>N5+16^DICN0 *DA(1).
  
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  NEW+1^SDWLE11 was changed to add the variable DO to its kill list.
  NEW+4^SDWLE11 was also changed to add incremental lock with timeout and 
  message for failed lock.

                                 to patients. A "Yes" in this field will
                                 enable patients to see their appointments
                                 in this clinic. If DIRECT PATIENT
                                 SCHEDULING? (#61) is set to YES, this
