 The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Access and Clinic Administrative
 Program (ACAP) has requested an enterprise enhancement for the VistA Scheduling
 Package. The enhancement will reduce operating cost for VHA and improve
 operational efficiencies resulting in patient centered access to care,
 coordinated care, increased customer satisfaction, and the reduction of
 excessive cycle/wait time used for scheduling patients.
  
 This patch contains phase 2 of the server API support for the VistA Scheduling
 Client as follows:
  
 ** For inpatients, the VS GUI shall display ward location in patient
    demographic area for each patient. To support this change, ward
    location has been included in the Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
    'SDEC GETREGA'.
  
 ** The VS GUI shall display special clinic instructions on the screen.
    The data from the SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS multiple field (#1910) in the
    HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) is now returned in the RPC 'SDEC CLINSET' to
    support this change.
  
 ** Add Cancel to the SDEC ACCESS TYPE file (#409.823) and use that access type
    in the return for the RPC 'SDEC CSLOTSCH' when the availability has been
    cancelled.
  
 ** Do not return clinics in RPCs when the OCCASION OF SERVICE CLINIC? field in
    the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) is defined as 'YES'.
  
 ** Add new RPC called 'SDEC APPSLOTS' to return availability string from
    VistA.
  
 ** Add W2VA - WELCOME TO VA to the Set of codes in the REQUEST TYPE
    field (#4) of the SDEC APPT REQUEST file (#409.85).
  
 ** Add the RPC 'SDEC NOAVAIL' to determine if availability has ever
    been defined for a given clinic.
  
 ** Add the multiple field VS AUDIT to the SD WAIT LIST file (#409.3)
    and SDEC APPT REQUEST file (#409.85). The RPCs 'SDEC WLSET' and
    'SDEC ARSET' have been enhanced to support adds and updates to these
    new multiples. The RPCs 'SDECAR AUDITGET' and 'SDECWL AUDITGET' have
    been added to retrieve the data from these new multiples.
  
 ** OT4 Release 2 - Comp & Pension Appointments. Support for AMIE
    scheduling event driver.
  
 ** Updates to the RPCs 'SDEC APPADD', 'SDEC ARMRTSET', 'SDEC ARSET', and
    'SDEC ARGET' have been implemented to support the PARENT/CHILD
    relationships between entries in the SDEC APPT REQUEST file (#409.85).
  
 ** Add the RPC 'SDECAPP GETYPE' to get the APPOINTMENT TYPE for the given
    SDEC APPOINTMENT id.
  
 ** Change the COMMENT field of the SDEC APPT REQUEST file (#409.85) to accept
    80 characters instead of 60.
  
 ** Single Sign-on support for CALL CENTER.
  
 ** Updates to SSN formatted inputs in the RPC 'SDEC PTLOOKRS'.
