 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================= 
  
 1)  INC000000908057 - NPCD Shut Down and deactivation of HL7 messages 
                       for PCMM.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In 2009, it became no longer necessary to transmit PCMM data to Austin
 via HL7 messages because the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) was being
 used to populate the VHA Support Service Center (VSSC). Approval was
 recently granted to shut down the PCMM HL7 functionality because 
 Austin started rejecting the entries.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Documentation updates/deletions are as follows:
    Updates
    -------
    PIMS Technical Manual
    PCMM User Manual
  
    Deletions
    ---------
    HL7 Interface Spec: Primary Care Acknowledgment Processing
    HL7 Interface Spec: Transmission of PCMM Primary Care Data
    PCMM Transmission Provider Workload to AAC User Manual
  
 Routine SCMCHL7K will be added as a pre-install routine with the 
 following functions:
  
  - Disable the PCMM logical link to HL7   
            ^^^ NOTE: The PCMM WORK logical link has nothing to do with 
                the functionality being disabled. 
                ONLY the PCMM logical link will be disabled.
  - Unschedule the PCMM HL7 Transmission [SCMC PCMM HL7 TRANSMIT] 
    scheduled job
  - Delete the HL7 data in the following three files:
    1) PCMM HL7 TRANSMISSION LOG FILE (#404.471)
    2) PCMM HL7 EVENT FILE (#404.48)
    3) PCMM HL7 ID FILE (#404.49)
  
 This routine will also set the following options out-of-order:
  
    1) PCMM HL7 AND MAINTENANCE MENU                        [SCMC HL7 MENU]
    2) PCMM Transmission Error Code Report      [SCMC PCMM ERR CODE REPORT]
    3) PCMM HL7 Transmission                       [SCMC PCMM HL7 TRANSMIT]
    4) PCMM Reject Transmission Menu          [SCMC PCMM REJECT TRANS MENU]
    5) PCMM Transmission Error Processing      [SCMC PCMM TRANS ERROR PROC]
    6) PCMM Transmission Error Report        [SCMC PCMM TRANS ERROR REPORT]
  
 The remaining options on the PCMM HL7 AND MAINTENANCE MENU that are not 
 being placed out order must be assigned as stand-alone options, if 
 needed. A list of these options is available in the PCMM User Manual.
  
  
 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 ========================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
    
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the file from 
      download.vista.domain.ext, which will transmit the file from 
      the first available FTP server.
     
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
      specific server as follows:
     
      Albany                ftp.domain.ext
      Hines                 ftp.domain.ext
      Salt Lake City        ftp.domain.ext
     
      The documentation distribution includes:
  
      File Name                 Contents                 Retrieval Format

      pcmmug.pdf                PCMM User Manual         BINARY
  
 Following the release of this patch, the updated Manuals will be 
 available on the VDL.
  
  
 The following documentation is obsolete with the release of this patch 
 and will be deleted from the VDL upon release of SD*5.3*624.
