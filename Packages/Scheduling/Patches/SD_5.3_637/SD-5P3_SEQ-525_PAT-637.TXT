Description:
============

 This patch provides Fiscal Year 2016 updates to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) 
 file as requested by the Office of Finance, Managerial Cost Accounting 
 Office (MCAO).
  
                         *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 **************************************************************************
 ** This patch is being released with a compliance date of October 1,    **
 ** 2015. This patch should be installed as close to Close of Business   **
 ** (COB) on September 30, 2015 as possible, but not after October 1,    **
 ** 2015. Early installation of this patch could result in transmission  **
 ** of incorrect stop codes that will result in errors from Austin.      **
 ** Coordination with the Medical Administration Service (MAS) Program   **
 ** Application Specialist (PAS)/Automated Data Processing Application   **
 ** Coordinator (ADPAC) is imperative as the patch will cause changes    **
 ** to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file. Testing can be done in a site's     **
 ** mirror account before installation in production to verify changes.  **
 ** This patch creates and renames stop codes effective October 1, 2015; **
 ** therefore, installing early may modify certain stop codes that may   **
 ** currently be in use at your site. It is advised that clinics with    **
 ** stop codes assigned that will incur restriction date/type changes    **
 ** should be corrected as soon as possible after installation. Please   **
 ** keep in mind that new stop code corrections should not be assigned   **
 ** in MAS/Scheduling until October 1, 2015 as the PCE encounters        **
 ** bearing FY16 stop codes will not be accepted in Austin until that    **
 ** date. All other MAS stop code corrections should be made as early    **
 ** as possible on October 1, 2015.                                      **

 Managerial Cost Accounting (MCA) Site Team Instructions for FY16 Stop 
 Code Patch:
  
 This patch makes additions and changes to the Clinic Stop (#40.7) file as 
 of October 1, 2015.
  
 No clinic can be created using any new Stop Codes contained in the patch 
 until after this patch is implemented.  Any clinic using a Stop Code 
 inactivated by the patch should have an active Stop Code assigned.  
 Assigning appropriate active Stop Codes to clinics can be accomplished 
 prior to patch implementation if desired.
  
 MCA Site Teams, Scheduling and Information Resources Management (IRM) 
 should coordinate to perform the following sequence:
  
   1. For FY15:  Run the DSS worksheet option Create DSS Clinic Stop Code
      File [ECXSCLOAD] option. Then, make any necessary adjustments before 
      approval so all clinics on the worksheet have setups applicable for
      the month of September 2015.
  
   2. IRM installs the patch late on September 30 or early on October 1,
      2015.
  
   3. Run the Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report [SD CLN STOP CODE
      REP] option to list those clinics that need changes in the Hospital
      Location (#44) file for FY16.  DO NOT make changes using Enter/Edit 
      DSS Stop Codes for Clinics [ECXSCEDIT] option for the CLINICS AND
      STOP CODES (#728.44) file at this time.  Work with scheduling staff
      to make changes in Hospital Location (#44) file so that the clinics
      will have the correct stop codes in place for October 1st clinic
      appointments.
  
   4. Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract for September
      2015. Do not edit clinic changes for October stop code changes with
      the Enter/Edit DSS Stop Codes for Clinics [ECXSCEDIT] option prior to
      running the September CLI Extract.  It is the edit, not the "approve"
      that puts the data into the extract.  Perform normal AUDITS for the
      CLI Extract.
  
   5. After auditing and receiving confirmation of successful deblocking of
      the transmitted September CLI Extract, proceed with FY16 Stop Code
      changes to the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes Worksheet clinics.
    
   6. For FY16:
  
      a. Run the Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File [ECXSCLOAD] option.
         This option creates local entries in the CLINICS AND STOP CODES 
         (#728.44) file and compares this file to the HOSPITAL LOCATION
         (#44) file to see if there are any differences since the last time
         the file was reviewed.
  
      b. Use the option Clinics and DSS Stop Codes Print option
         [ECXSCLIST] option.
         This option produces a worksheet of (A) All Clinics, (C) Active,
         (D) Duplicate, (I) Inactive, (U) Unreviewed Clinics, or only 
         the (X) Export to Text File for Spreadsheet Use that are awaiting
         approval.
  
      c. Update for FY16 as needed using the Enter/Edit DSS Stop Codes for
         Clinics [ECXSCEDIT] option.
  
      d. Approve changes using the Approve Reviewed DSS Clinic Worksheet
         [ECXSCAPPROV] option. Finalize all Stop Code changes on the
         worksheet to be ready to run the October DSS CLI Extract.
