Subject: COMMUNITY CARE CONSULT STOP CODE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) created over 2.5 million 
 authorizations for Veterans to receive care in the community in fiscal 
 year 2015 - an 8.6% increase in authorizations when compared to fiscal 
 year 2014.
  
 The Access and Clinic Administration Program (ACAP) requested that the 
 Stop Code Council establish a new Stop Code to track Community Care 
 Consults. Tracking Community Care Consults is a high priority of the 
 Secretary of the VA and Congress. The enormous volume and importance of 
 Community Care Consults means that VA needs a tracking mechanism to 
 identify these consults; this patch adds a new stop code 669, COMMUNITY 
 CARE CONSULT, to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file as requested by the Office 
 of Finance, Managerial Cost Accounting Office (MCAO).
  
                         *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 **************************************************************************
 ** This patch is being released with a compliance date of May 1, 2016.  **
 ** This patch should be installed as close to Close of Business (COB)   **
 ** on April 30, 2016 as possible, but not after May 1, 2016. Early      **
 ** installation of this patch could result in transmission of incorrect **
 ** Stop Codes that will result in errors from Austin. Coordination with **
 ** the MAS (Medical Administration Service) PAS (Program Application    **
 ** Specialist)/ADPAC (Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator)**
 ** is imperative as the patch will cause changes to the CLINIC STOP     **
 ** (#40.7) file. Testing can be done in a site's mirror account before  **
 ** installation in production to verify changes. This patch creates a   **
 ** Stop Code that is effective May 1, 2016; please keep in mind that    **
 ** new Stop Code corrections should not be assigned in MAS/Scheduling   **
 ** until May 1, 2016.                                                   **

      MCA (Managerial Cost Accounting) Sites Team Instructions for the
                      FY16 Emergency Stop Code Patch:
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 This patch makes an addition to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file as of 
 May 1, 2016.
  
 No Clinics can be created using the new Stop Code contained in the patch
 until after this patch is implemented.
  
 MCA Sites Teams, Scheduling, and IRM (Information Resource Management)
 should coordinate to perform the following sequence:
  
   1. Run the DSS worksheet menu option, Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File
      [ECXSCLOAD]. Then, make any necessary adjustments before approval so
      all clinics on the worksheet have setups applicable for the month of
      April 2016.
  
   2. IRM installs the patch late on April 30 or early on May 1, 2016.
  
   3. Run the Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report [SD CLN STOP CODE 
      REP] to list those clinics that need changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION
      (#44) file. DO NOT make changes using the menu option, Enter/Edit
      Clinic Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] for the CLINICS AND STOP 
      CODES (#728.44) file at this time. Work with Scheduling staff to
      make changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file so that the clinics
      will have the correct Stop Codes in place for May 1st Non VA clinic
      consult appointments.
  
   4. Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract and ECS Extract
      for April 2016. Do not edit clinic changes for the May Stop Code
      change with the menu option, Enter/Edit Clinic Parameters [ECXSCEDIT]
      or in DSS Unit Setup Screens in Event Capture prior to running the
      April CLI Extract. It is the edit, not the "approve" that changes the
      values included in the extract. Perform normal AUDITS for the CLI
      Extract.
  
   5. After auditing and receiving confirmation of successful deblocking of
      the transmitted April CLI Extract, proceed with the Stop Code change
      to the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes Worksheet clinics and in any DSS
      Units set to Send No Records to PCE.
  
   6. For this emergency patch:
  
      a. Run the menu option, Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File [ECXSCLOAD].
         This option creates local entries in the CLINICS AND STOP CODE
         (#728.44) file and compares this file to the HOSPITAL LOCATION
         (#44) file to see if there are any differences since the last time
         the file was reviewed.
  
      b. Use the menu option, Clinics and DSS Stop Codes Print [ECXSCLIST]
         to identify existing clinics with stop code 674 in the primary
         position. Coordinate with clinic makers to identify and edit MAS
         Clinic Set-up for those existing clinics which fit the Community
         Care consult criteria. Not all active clinics with 674 will fit
         the Community Care criteria. Only non-count clinics using 674 in
         the primary position may be changed to stop code 669; all other
         Stop Code changes will require a new clinic. This option produces
         a worksheet of (A) All Clinics, (C) Active, (D) Duplicate, (I)
         Inactive, (U) Unreviewed Clinics that are awaiting
         approval, and (X) Export to Text File for Spreadsheet.
  
      c. Update for the patch as needed using the menu option, Enter/Edit
         Clinic Parameters [ECXSCEDIT]. Clinics changed to use stop
         code 669 in the primary or secondary position should be assigned
         Action to Send Code = 6.
  
      d. Approve the changes using menu option, Approve Reviewed DSS
         Clinic Worksheet [ECXSCAPPROV]. Finalize all Stop Code changes on
         the worksheet to be ready to run the April DSS CLI Extract.
  
      e. Make needed Stop Code changes in Event Capture to DSS Units set to
         Send No Records to PCE.
