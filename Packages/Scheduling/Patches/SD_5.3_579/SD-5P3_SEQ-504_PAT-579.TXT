 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC000000426114 - letters not dated and do not contain letter and last 
                      4.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site requested to add the date the Recall letter is printed, the first
    letter of the patient's name and the last four digits of the patient's
    social security number to Recall letters.
  
    This is the format for all other scheduling letters. Site requested
    this information to be added to the letters to become standardized to
    national packages.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines SDRRTSK and SDRRRECL have been modified to add the date the 
    letter was printed, the first letter of the patient's last name 
    followed by the last four digits of their social security number on the
    upper right part of the Recall letter when using the Auto Print for
    Recall Reminder [SDRR TASK JOB] or Print Letter by Patient
    under the Clinic Recall Print Menu [SDRR PRINT MENU] menu options.
  
    This change only applies to recall letters; recall cards will not be
    affected.
  
  
 2. INC000000440303 - letters not printing on one printer.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A site reported that recall letters are not printing on a printer due
    to an <UNDEFINED>DATE+21^SDRRTSK error occurring when the nightly
    background job runs.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine SDRRTSK to check if the record exist in the RECALL
    REMINDERS (#403.5) file so that the error no longer occurs.
  
  
 3. INC000000812157 - <UNDEFINED>DQD1+7^SDRRRECL error.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    An undefined error, <UNDEFINED>DQD1+7^SDRRRECL, occurs when running
    the option Print Letters by Provider under the Clinic Recall Print menu
    [SDRR PRINT MENU] menu option.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine SDRRRECL to check if the record exists in the RECALL 
    REMINDERS (#403.5) file so that the error no longer occurs.
  
  
 4. INC000000812162 - <UNDEFINED>DQD4+7^SDRRRECL error
    
    Problem:
    --------
    An undefined error, <UNDEFINED>DQD4+7^SDRRRECL, occurs when running
    Print Letters by Team option under the Clinic Recall Print Menu [SDRR
    PRINT MENU] menu option.                            
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine SDRRRECL to check if the record exists in the RECALL
    REMINDERS (#403.5) file so that the error no longer occurs.
  
  
 5. INC000000812170 - <UNDEFINED>START+17^SDRRTSK1 error
  
    Problem:
    --------
    An undefined error, <UNDEFINED>START+17^SDRRTSK1, occurs when running
    Auto Print for Recall Reminder Cards [SDRR TASK JOB CARD] menu option.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine SDRRTSK1 to check if the record exists in the RECALL
    REMINDERS (#403.5) file so that the error no longer occurs.
  
  
 6. INC000000456023 - Letter prints with Suffix listed before last name
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a patient has a suffix in their name, such as, JR, SR, II, III,
    etc., the patient's name on the letters and cards are printing the
    suffix in front of the patient's last name.
  
    For example, the letter/card salutation is being printed as:
  
    FIRST MIDDLE JR LAST
  
    Instead of:
  
    FIRST MIDDLE LAST JR
  
    This problem occurs with the background print as well as the manual 
    letter print.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines SDRRTSK, SDRRTSK1, SDRRRECL, and SDRRRECP have been modified
    so that the patient's salutation correctly prints the suffix in the
    patient's name, when applicable.
  
  
 7. INC000000880311 - Scheduling - Recall Reminder: coding discrepancy in 
                      patient address
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A site requested to remove the comma between city and state on a 
    patient's address when printing the recall reminder letter.
  
    This is the format for all other scheduling letters.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines SDRRTSK, SDRRTSK1, SDRRRECL, and SDRRRECP have been modified 
    so that the format of the recall patient's address can be properly 
    printed.
