Subject: FIX STATUS DISPLAY IN APPOINTMENT MGMT AND LIST BY APPOINTMENT

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix a functionality issue that was introduced with patch 
 SD*5.3*591, whereby the incorrect status for an appointment is being 
 displayed in Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT] when an appointment
 has only been partially Checked Out. The original request pointed to
 incorrect displayed status of an appointment if it was purged.
 Additionally the List by Appointment [PXCE SDAM LIST] protocol was evaluated 
 to provide a consistent appointment status display when this protocol is
 executed in the PCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY options in Patient Care Encounter
 (PCE).

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000618919 - Appt Mgmt does not show that a vet has been checked out
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When retrieving the status for an appointment, if the appointment has
 only been partially Checked Out, the status in Appointment Management
 [SDAM APPT MGT] will be incorrectly displayed as 'No Action Taken', unless
 the appointment was first Checked In (which is no longer required).
 If the appointment has been Checked In, the partially Checked Out 
 appointment will correctly display the status as 'Act Req/Checked Out';
 however, a partially Checked Out appointment should display a status of
 'Act Req/Checked Out', regardless of whether it has been Checked In.
 Once the appointment is fully Checked Out, it does display the correct
 status of 'Checked Out'.  This issue only occurs with partially Checked
 Out appointments.
  
 During testing it was discovered that some appointments had 'NT' status in 
 the Appointment multiple entries while being already CHECKED OUT as indicated
 in the Outpatient Encounter file and it affected the status display when
 listing by appointment in PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY options in PCE.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SDAM1 has been modified to determine how the appointment
 status is calculated and displayed. The new logic evaluates the related
 entry in the Outpatient Encounter file, if it exists, to provide correct
 status as displayed in Scheduling and PCE in VistA. The displayed results
 are consistent and reflect the true status of appointments.
