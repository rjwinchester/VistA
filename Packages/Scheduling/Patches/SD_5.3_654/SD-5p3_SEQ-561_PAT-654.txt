 CA SDM Ticket Overview:
 =======================
  
 1. I9834903FY16 - Scheduling - Recall Reminder:
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When manually reprinting recall notification letters or cards, the 
    Recall Reminder Sent (DATE REMINDER SENT field (#6)) or the Date
    Second Reminder Sent (SECOND PRINT field (#8)) of the RECALL
    REMINDERS file (#403.5), would get updated even if the recall letter
    or card is being sent to display to the computer screen.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines SDRRRECL and SDRRRECP have been modified to not update the 
    Recall Reminder Sent (DATE REMINDER SENT field (#6)) or Date Second
    Reminder Sent (SECOND PRINT field (#8)) if the recall letter or
    card is only displayed to the computer screen.
    
  
 2. I9835477FY16 - Missing DFN when checking bad address indicator
  
    Problem:
    --------
    If a patient's address is flagged with the Bad Address Indicator 
    (BAI), a MailMan message does not get generated and sent to the
    mail group, SDRR BAD ADDRESS, to warn users when manually reprinting
    Recall Reminder letters and cards. 
    
    The notification letter or card is still printed and mailed to the 
    patient with an invalid address.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines SDRRRECL and SDRRRECP are modified to not print the patient's
    recall letter or card if patient's bad address is indicated.
  
    Added a missing DFN when calling $$BADADR^DGUTL3 for properly creating
    a MailMan message and quits printing if the patient has a bad address.
  
  
 3. I9836522FY16 - Word modification in the MailMan message
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When printing recall letters, and a patient's address is flagged with
    a Bad Address Indicator, the subject line of the MailMan warning
    message is incorrect. The subject line should indicate 'Bad Address
    - letter will not be printed for:' not 'Bad Address- card will not be
    printed for:'. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines SDRRTSK and SDRRRECL have been modified to change the word
    from 'card' to 'letter' in the MailMan message if the patient has a Bad
    Address Indicator set when printing letters.
  
  
 4. I6076714FY16 - Recall Reminder Letter Does Not Include Complete Address
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The recall reminder letter does not include the complete address for a 
    Canadian veteran. In VistA, a Canadian address includes the Street 
    Address [Line 1], City, Postal code, Province, and Country fields. The 
    recall reminder letters print the Street Address and City only. The 
    Postal code, Province, and Country fields are not included. Letters 
    are returned back to the site as undeliverable.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routines SDRRRECL, SDRRRECP, SDRRTSK, and SDRRTSK1 to ensure
    Canadian address is printed completely and correctly for Canadian 
    veterans.
