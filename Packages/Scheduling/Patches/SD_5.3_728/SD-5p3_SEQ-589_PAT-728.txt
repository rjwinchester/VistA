Package : SD - SCHEDULING                     Priority: Mandatory
Version : 5.3       SEQ #589                    Status: Released

Associated patches: (v)SD*5.3*696  <<= must be installed BEFORE `SD*5.3*728'

Subject: FY20 STOP CODE CHANGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 SD*5.3*728 provides Fiscal Year 2020 updates to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7)
 file as requested by the Office of Finance, Managerial Cost Accounting
 Office (MCAO).
  
                          *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 **************************************************************************
 *  This patch is being released with a compliance date of October 1,     *
 *  2019 and should be installed as close to Close of Business (COB) on   *
 *  September 30, 2019 as possible, but not after October 1, 2019. Early  *
 *  installation of this patch could result in transmission of incorrect  *
 *  Stop Codes that will result in errors from Austin.  Coordination with *
 *  the MAS (Medical Administration Service) PAS (Program Application     *
 *  Specialist)/ADPAC (Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator) *
 *  is imperative as SD*5.3*728 will cause changes to the CLINIC STOP     *
 *  (#40.7) file. Testing can be done in a site's mirror account before   *
 *  installation in production to verify changes. SD*5.3*728 modifies and *
 *  creates Stop Codes effective October 1, 2019; therefore, installing   *
 *  early may modify certain Stop Codes that may currently be in use at   *
 *  your site.  It is advised that clinics with Stop Codes assigned that  *
 *  will incur restriction date/type changes should be corrected as soon  *
 *  as possible after installation. Please keep in mind that new Stop     *
 *  Codes should not be assigned in MAS/Scheduling until October 1, 2019  *
 *  as the PCE encounters bearing FY20 Stop Codes will not be accepted in *
 *  Austin until that date.  All other MAS Stop Code changes should be    *
 *  made as early as possible on October 1, 2019.                         *

 Instructions for the FY20 Stop Code Patch:
  
 SD*5.3*728 makes additions and changes to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file
 as of October 1, 2019. No clinic can be created using any new Stop Codes 
 contained in the patch until after this patch is implemented.
  
 Scheduling & IRM should coordinate to perform the following sequence: 
  
 1. IRM installs the patch late on September 30 or early on October 1, 
    2019.
  
 2. Scheduling staff: Run the Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report 
    [SD CLN STOP CODE REP] to list those clinics that need changes in the
    HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file for FY20.
  
 3. Scheduling staff: Make changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) 
    file so that the clinics will have the correct Stop Codes in place 
    for October 1st clinic appointments.
  
 MCA Staff:
  
 1. Before October 1 (prior to installation of the patch) run Option 2:
    Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File [ECXSCLOAD] from the Setup for DSS 
    Clinic Information menu [ECX SETUP CLINIC].
  
 2. Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract for September 2019.
    It is the create and edit, not the 'approve', that changes the values 
    included in the CLI extract.  Perform normal AUDITS for the CLI 
    Extract.
  
 3. DO NOT make changes for October clinics at this time.  
  
 4. Between October 12 and 31, after auditing and receiving confirmation 
    of successful deblocking of the transmitted September CLI Extract,
    proceed with FY20 Stop Code changes to the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes
    Worksheet:
  
    a. After the September extract has been run, transmitted and is 
       considered final (in your mind, no re-run/re-transmit needed), you
       may run Option 2 CREATE DSS Clinic Stop Code File [ECXSCLOAD].  
       This option creates local entries in the CLINICS AND STOP CODES
       (#728.44) file and compares this file to the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44)
       file to see if there are any differences since the last time the
       file was reviewed.
  
    b. After Option 2 has completed, use the Option 3:  Clinics and DSS
       Stop Codes Print [ECXSCLIST].  This option produces a worksheet of
       (A) All Clinics, (C) Active, (I) Inactive, or only the (U) 
       Unreviewed Clinics that are awaiting approval.
  
    c. Run Option 7:  Clinic & Stop Codes Validity Report [ECX STOP CODE
       VALIDITY].  This step will check that all Stop Codes conform.  
       Note:  a 'blank' output indicates there are no problems with Stop
       Code and credit stop validity.
  
    d. Update for FY20 as needed using Option 4:  Enter/Edit Clinic 
       Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] option.
  
    e. Approve changes using Option 5:  Approve Reviewed DSS Clinic 
       Worksheet [ECXSCAPPROV] option.  Finalize all Stop Code changes on 
       the worksheet to be ready to run the October DSS CLI Extract.
  
    f. MCA teams with questions, please log a WonderDesk ticket through
       http://vaww.dss.domain.ext/helpdsktckt.asp or by sending an
       Outlook message to the VHA MCAO CSHD mail group.
