 This patch will correct one defect in several Patient-Centered Management
 Module (PCMM) VistA Application Program Interface (API)s used by 
 MyHealtheVet (MHV) Secure Messaging (SM).
  
 Software Changes:
 =================
  
 Entry point TPPR^SCAPMC12 was modified to fix a function call where an 
 array was not passed by reference.
  
 Entry point INIT^SCAPMCU1 was modified to default to current date/time 
 rather than just current date.
  
 Entry point DTCHK^SCAPU1 was modified to fix several date compare defects.
  
  
 RTC defect 333486 was logged by MHV Secure Messaging.
 Secure Messaging team is supporting PCMMR team with the release of this 
 VistA patch.

 1. RTC 333486 Defect - PCMM Provider not showing in SM Admin Query. 
 Problem:
 When Secure Messaging (SM) Primary Care providers (PCP) are associated to 
 teams in PCMM Web (PCMM-R) as PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER or 
 PHISICIAN-ATTENDING roles, they should be available to be selected as PCP 
 in SM Triage Groups that enable the secure communication between the 
 patients and their PCP team.
 After the PCP association with the PCMM-R team is synced in VistA, the 
 new provider association is not showing until the next calendar day which 
 results in a delay of a maximum of 24 hours. During this period the 
 provider is unavailable to be selected in the SM Triage Group for 
 receiving/sending emails to his/her patients.
 This issue is caused by the VistA Scheduling APIs that MHV SM is using 
 (Integration Agreement #5250) to extract the VistA provider association. 
 This results in the PCP flags not being retrieved correctly from the 
 VistA Team Position Assignment and History files.
  
 Resolution:
 The code was changed to correct the API calls for Integration Agreement 
 #5250. The code was changed to use the Date/Time stamps (vs. just the 
 date) to compare the time of the PCP associations to PCMM-R teams. This 
 makes the data available for the API queries to pull the data from VistA 
 immediately after PCMM-R VistA sync jobs have run to update the team
 information in VistA.
