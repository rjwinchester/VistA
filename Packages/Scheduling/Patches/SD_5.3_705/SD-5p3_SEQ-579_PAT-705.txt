Description:
============

 This patch will include code changes for several routines for two NSR's 
 that were approved by the Software Modification Waiver Committee 
 associated with Scheduling Package in VistA.
  
 The following will be addressed in this patch:
     1) Add A Blank Line Between Appointments in Print Scheduling Letters
        [SDPRLETTERS]. This is an optional feature which can be enabled if the 
        site wants to use it.
  
     2) Modifications were made to VistA Scheduling Option Display 
        Appointments [SDDISPPEND] to allow a site the ability to included 
        additional header text which could include Station Name, Station 
        Address, Station Phone Numbers, etc.  Changes were also made to display 
        the Primary Care provider, Associate Provider and team, as well as the 
        physical location for an appointment. Clinic appointments were screened 
        for administrative clinics, and finally, output of Social Security
        Number (SSN) was truncated to four digits instead of outputting the
        entire SSN.
     
        Note that the following features are optional and can be enabled if
        the site wants to use them:
             Add additional header information to the Patient Scheduling Letter
             Exclude clinic appointments for administrative clinics.
   
     3) Modifications made to menu option SCHEDULING PARAMETERS [SD PARM 
        PARAMETERS] to enter/edit new fields Additional Header Text,
        Exclude Administrative Clinics and Enable Blank Line fields.
  
 TECHNICAL SUMMARY:
 ==================   
  
 Routines
 --------
 The routine SDLT was modified to add a blank line between appointments in 
 Print Scheduling Letters.
  
 The routine SDDPA was modified to Print Address Header, to Display PC 
 Provider, Associate and Team, to Truncate SSN to Display Only Last Four
 Digits, to Display Important Station Phone Numbers, to Display Physical
 Location for An Appointment and to Screens Out Call Appointments (Stop
 Code 674).
  
 Routines SDPARM, SPARM1 and SDPARM2 were modified to add fields Additional 
 Header Text, Exclude Administrative Clinics and Enable Blank Line fields to 
 menu option SCHEDULING PARAMETERS [SD PARM PARAMETERS].
