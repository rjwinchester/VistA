Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. Duplicate encounters show on the PCE Encounter List screen for a future
    appointment that has notes associated with it before the date of the
    visit.
 2. Consult Service names are being truncated in the Make Consult 
    Appointment [SC MAKE CONSULT APPOINTMENT] option.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1. INC0000001090035 - 5 Patch PX*1*124 not working as described for one 
                       patient
  
 Problem:
 ========
 If a future appointment is made and then notes are associated with that
 appointment before the day of the appointment, the PCE Encounter List
 screen will show a duplicate encounter after either one of the following 
 two things happen:
  
   1) The appointment is checked out on the day of the appointment
   or 
   2) The appointment is not touched on the day it is scheduled, but then
      the Appointment Status Update (Background) option [SDAM BACKGROUND JOB] 
      is run for that date (the appointment date).
   
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A check was added to the ^SDVSIT routine to look for an existing entry in the
 VISIT file [#9000010] for the exact date/time of the appointment and to use 
 that visit if it exists for the patient instead of creating new one IF the
 appointment's SERVICE CATEGORY, POINTER TO CLINIC STOP FILE, POINTER TO 
 HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44), & ENCOUNTER TYPE all match the existing
 entry. A timeout was also added to a lock in SDVSIT to correct an XINDEX
 error.
  
 2. INC0000001090076 - Truncated Display of Consult Service Name  
   
 Problem:
 ========
 The list of consults screen in the Make Consult Appointment 
 [SC MAKE CONSULT APPOINTMENT] option does not allocate enough columns to show 
 the entire consult service name in all cases. Sometimes the consult service 
 name gets truncated. The SERVICE NAME field (#.01) in the REQUEST SERVICES 
 file (#123.5) can have a maximum length of 63. The list of consults screen 
 only allows a length of 23 before it truncates. This can lead to an
 incorrect consult service being selected.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Increased the display length of the Consult Service Name in routine ^SDCNSLT 
 to 63 (the maximum length of the field). This allows users to differentiate
 between multiple services. Other fields were relocated to a second line.
