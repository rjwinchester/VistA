Description:
============

 Patch SD*5.3*638 addresses three Remedy ticket issues:
  
 1. A request has been made to discontinue the bi-monthly Electronic Wait 
    List (EWL) transmissions to the Austin Information Technology (AITC).
  
 2. Users are unable to remove data from the DATE INACTIVATED (#3) field
    in the SD WL CLINIC LOCATION (#409.32) file if there are open Wait List
    entries.
  
 3. When adding Wait List entries by Service Specialty, if a specific
    clinic is added and Auditing is turned on, a subscript error will 
    occur.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000001277998 - Scheduling - EWL Austin Transmit
   
    Problem: 
    --------
    A request has been made to stop the bi-monthly Electronic Wait List
    (EWL) transmissions from the VistA sites to the Austin Information
    Technology Center (AITC). The VHA Service Support Center (VSSC) has
    converted to obtain that data now from the Corporate Data Warehouse
    (CDW), and they are no longer using the data being sent by the sites.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    VistA option SD Wait List Trans to AAC [SD WAIT LIST TRANS TO AAC] will
    be disabled using post-install routine SDWL638. This routine will also
    remove any Task Man scheduled tasks to prevent further data
    transmissions. A QUIT command will also be added to routine SDWLTR to
    prevent the option from being executed unintentionally.
  
 2. INC000001296005 - Scheduling - EWL Issue with accessing wait list option
   
    Problem: 
    --------
    If a clinic has been inactivated from Wait List functionality while
    having open Wait List entries; users are unable to reactivate the
    clinic.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A check will be added to routine SDWLPE to determine if a clinic
    already has a date in the DATE INACTIVATED (#3) field of the SD WL
    CLINIC LOCATION (#409.32) file before evaluating open Wait List entries
    and forcing the user to exit the option.
  
 3. INC000001297501 - <SUBSCRIPT>IX+1^DIE1 ^SDWL(409.3,"SCC","")
   
    Problem: 
    --------
    When creating a service/specialty wait list type, if the user adds a
    clinic the software is designed to change the entry from
    service/specialty to specific clinic. This is done by deleting the
    current record and creating another using FileMan calls. When Auditing
    is turned on the SD WAIT LIST (#409.3) file, a subscript error occurs.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Resetting the DA variable in between a FILE^DICN call and a ^DIE call
    in CLIN^SDWLE2 will prevent the subscript error from occurring when
    Auditing is enabled.
  
 Documentation:
 --------------
 The EWL user manual will be updated to remove information on bi-monthly
 transmissions on pages 82-84. This information will be replaced with a message
 advising that information is now passed between the VSSC and the CDW.
