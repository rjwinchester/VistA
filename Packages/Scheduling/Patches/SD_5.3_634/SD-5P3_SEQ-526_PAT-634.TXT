Subject: PAIT IPv6 ADDRESS FORMAT MODIFICATION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 In preparation for the VA's transition from Internet Protocol version 4 
 (IPv4) to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), the Patient Appointment 
 Information Transmission (PAIT) package will require modifications to 
 make it IPv6 ready.
  
 IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IP), the 
 communications protocol that provides an identification and location 
 system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. 
 IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal 
 with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 is 
 intended to replace IPv4.
  
 VistA is only compatible with IPv4 currently and this effort is to 
 prepare for IPv6 compatibility.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 INC000001094333  PAIT IPv6 Conversion
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When SD-PAIT tasked transmission job is completed, a job completion 
 bulletin is generated and sent to the SD-PAIT mail group. Currently,
 the length of the IP Address column for this MailMan message is for 
 the IPv4 address format. It needs to be expanded to have enough
 space for the new IPv6 address format. 
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SDRPA04 has been modified by this patch. The length of the IP 
 Address column in this MailMan message has been increased from eleven
 (11) characters to thirty-nine (39) characters to accommodate this new
 IPv6 address format.
  
 After this patch is released, both address formats can be displayed 
 properly in this MailMan message.
  
  
 Technical:
 ==========
 The current IPv4 address format looks like: nn.nn.nn.nn
  
 The future IPv6 address format will look like:
 hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh:hhhh
  
 n = Numeric value.
 h = Hexadecimal value
  
  
 Software and Documentation Distribution:
 ========================================
 Sites may retrieve the updated documentation directly via FTP. The 
 preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
 download.vista.domain.ext
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.
  
 Sites may also elect to retrieve the documentation directly from the
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory from a specific server as follows:
  
 Albany:                       ftp.domain.ext
 Hines:                        ftp.domain.ext
 Salt Lake City:               ftp.domain.ext

 PAIT_TECHNICAL_MANUAL.PDF     PAIT Technical Manual    Binary
  
 These files must be transferred using the binary (BIN) file transfer mode.
  
 The complete and updated manuals will be posted to the VDL immediately 
 after the release of the patch.
