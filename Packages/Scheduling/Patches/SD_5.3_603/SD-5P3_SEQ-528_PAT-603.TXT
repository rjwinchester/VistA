Description:
============

 This patch implements changes to VistA required to support the new 
 Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web. There is a companion CPRS
 patch (OR*3.0*387) that implements changes to Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
 required to display content for the Primary Care Header and Detail Window.
  
 This patch is a part of a phased, coordinated process for deploying PCMM 
 Web. The VistA software for this patch and the companion OR*3.0*387 
 patch is released as two KIDS host files. They may be downloaded from a 
 secured ftp site as directed by the PCMM Web Implementation Team.
  
 *******************************************************************
 DO NOT INSTALL THIS PATCH ON A PRODUCTION SYSTEM UNTIL NOTIFIED BY 
 THE PCMM WEB IMPLEMENTATION MANAGER.
 *******************************************************************
  
 In order to fully support a team based, patient-centric approach to
 healthcare delivery, enhancements to PCMM have been developed to allow a
 team to be formed and aligned around a patient, including providers across
 multiple VA sites and in non-VA settings to enable care coordination and
 communication. The software supports automated data collection for
 management metrics and analysis related to access, workload, and panel
 management. VHA's model of team-based care is known as the
 Patient-Aligned Care Team (PACT). The goal is to evolve and replace
 existing PCMM software with functionality that identifies all team members
 and specialists (VA and non-VA) involved in the care of the patient, as
 well as their contact information and provide modalities to facilitate
 provider-provider communication. This new PACT Management Module is known
 as PCMM Web. According to the PCMM Modification Workgroup, the
 relationship between the patient and his/her Primary Care Provider (PCP)
 will help to enhance patient care and the treatment process. Patients who
 regularly visit the same PCP receive better healthcare and utilize fewer
 healthcare resources because of the PCP's ability to treat patients more
 efficiently and effectively.
  
 Most of the changes to VistA are to background processing that will not 
 be visible to users. An Application Proxy user was created to support 
 batch processing for reading and updating VistA files.

   teamlet member.
 The descriptions for the following field descriptions were modified to 
 reflect that PCMM Web will maintain FTEE history data.
   FTEE HISTORY multiple (#1)
     FTEE HISTORY (#.01) field
     VALUE (#.02) field
     USER (#.03) field
 The trigger (FTEXR) on the FTEE EQUIVALENT (#.09) field will be deleted by
 the post-install routine. (This trigger performed updates to FTEE 
 HISTORY, now maintained by PCMM Web.)

   CPRS HEADER TEXT (#.06) field - This field is populated by PCMM Web with
     primary care information to be displayed in the CPRS PCMM Header.
   CPRS PC WINDOW CACHE (#.07) field - This field stores the last data set 
     displayed in the CPRS Primary Care Details Window. This cached data
     will be displayed if there is no connection to PCMM Web.
  
 OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER (#409.68) file - A new Index, ACOD, was created to 
 sort records by the PATIENT (#.02) field and CHECK OUT PROCESS COMPLETION
 (#.07) field.

   EVENT CODE (#.03) field
   EVENT DATA (#.04) field
  
 TEAM PURPOSE (#403.47) File - Two records were added:
   PRIMARY CARE - NVCC
   PRIMARY CARE - HBPC
  
  
 Routines
 --------
 The routine SCMCTSK was modified to update several files when a patient 
 date of death is entered or removed in the PATIENT (#2) file.
   - User enters or removes a date of death for a patient in VistA
   - A cross reference on the PATIENT (#2) file DATE OF DEATH (#.351) field
     executes
       FC^DGFCPROT
   - This routine submits the DG FIELD MONITOR protocol to TaskMan
   - The DG FIELD MONITOR protocol executes the protocols in its Items list
   - The SCMC PCMM INACTIVATE ON DATE OF DEATH protocol executes 
       DEATH^SCMCTSK
   - This entry point updates the following File
       PCMM PATIENT EVENTS (#404.54) file - record is created or updated
  
 The routine SCMCTSK2 was modified to ensure the PCMM NIGHTLY TASK [SCMC 
 PCMM NIGHTLY TASK] menu option job never runs on VistA. (A QUIT statement
 was added immediately after the entry point - NIGHT.)
  
 Three new routines; SCMCWS1, SCMCWS1A, SCMCWSUT; were developed to 
 implement a new Application Program Interface (API) that calls a PCMM Web
 web service to retrieve PACT and other team information that is displayed
 in the CPRS PC Details Window.
 This API uses the HealtheVet Web Service Client (HWSC) to implement the 
 web service. The default set up is performed by the post-install routine.
 This API is called by the CPRS RPC: ORWPT1 PCDETAIL. A new ICR, 6027 - 
 SCMC PCMM/R GET PRIMARY CARE DETAILS, was created and activated to 
 support this functionality.
 These routines are also used by the new RPC, SCMC PCDETAIL. It is used to
 batch load CPRS PC Window Cache during PCMMR deployment.
  
 *************************************************************************
 NOTE: Sites will encounter an XINDEX Error after the installation of this
 patch. SCMCWS1 uses HWSC. It calls a Cache Class to parse the eXtensible 
 Markup Language (XML) document returned by the web service call.
 A SAC Exemption (134) was approved on 02/04/2015.
 *************************************************************************
  
 A new routine, SCMCDDR, was developed to implement the RPC, SCMC LISTER.
 It returns VistA data to PCMM Web using the VA FileMan DBS API: Lister
 (LIST^DIC).
  
 A new routine, SCMCDDR0, was developed to implement the RPC, SCMC FINDER.
 It returns VistA data to PCMM Web using the VA FileMan DBS API: Find
 (FIND^DIC).
  
 A new routine, SCMCDDR2, was developed to implement the RPC, SCMC GETS
 ENTRY DATA. It returns VistA data to PCMM Web using the VA FileMan DBS
 API: Data Retriever (GETS^DIQ). 
  
 A new routine, SCMCDDR3, was developed to implement the RPC, SCMC FILER.
 It updates VistA data from PCMM Web using a VA FileMan DBS APIs: Filer
 (FILE^DIE) and Updater (UPDATE^DIE).
  
 A new routine, SCMCENCT, was developed to implement the RPC, SCMC GET
 PATIENT ENCOUNTERS. It returns patient encounter data to PCMM Web. The
 data is used to determine if and when a patient had a completed encounter
 with a teamlet member.
  
 A new routine, SCMCNPER, was developed to implement the RPC, SCMC GET
 NEW PERSON. It returns provider information to PCMM Web.
  
 A new routine, SCMCPAT, was developed to implement two RPCs.
  SCMC PATIENT DIEDON returns a patient's date of death to PCMM Web.
  SCMC PATIENT INFO returns patient demographic information to PCMM Web.
  
 A new routine, SCMCFTEE, was developed to implement five RPCs; SCMC
 FTEE CREATE, SCMC FTEE READ, SCMC FTEE READALL, SCMC FTEE UPDATE, SCMC
 FTEE DELETE. They allow PCMM Web to maintain FTEE HISTORY multiple (#1) in
 the POSITION ASSIGNMENT HISTORY (#404.52) file.
  
 The routine SCMCMHTC was modified to fix a date comparison issue.
  
 The routine SCAPMC23 was modified to correct an endless loop when reading 
 unexpected data.
  
 The routine SCMCDD1 was modified to create or update OUTPATIENT PROFILE  
 (#404.41) file records for all assignment types. The routine was also
 modified to add "fail-safes" to quit processing if PATIENT TEAM ASSIGNMENT
 (#404.42) file or PATIENT TEAM POSITION ASSIGNMENT (#404.43) file records
 are not found when sending mail messages.
  
 Two routines, SCMCTSK5 and SCMCTSK6, were modified to change
 auto-inactivation related time periods and other text in report and mail
 boiler plate text. All auto-inactivation processing will be performed by
 PCMM Web.
  
 The routine SDCOU was modified to create ACOD index records for Credit 
 Stop Code OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER (#409.68) file records. The original code 
 did not properly handle new style indexes. The Set and Kill logic was 
 modified to do so.
  
 The pre-install routine, SD53I603, was developed to perform the following 
 actions:
  - Delete the global for the STANDARD POSITION (#403.46) file and create
    the initial file header.
  
 The post-install routine, SD53P603, was developed to perform the 
 following actions:
  - Add or update HWSC server and web service file entries
  - Add the application proxy user
  - Convert values in the PATIENT TEAM POSITION ASSIGNMENT (#404.43) file
    STATUS (#.12) field from NA to IU
  - Build the new ACOD index for the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER (#409.68) file
  - Build the new C cross reference for PATIENT TEAM POSITION ASSIGNMENT 
    (#404.43) file
  - Un-schedule the legacy PCMM NIGHTLY TASK [SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK]
    menu option from TaskMan
  - Place PCMM legacy menu options out-of-order
  - Change users' secondary menu option from SCMC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION to
    SCMC PCMMR WEB USER MENU
  - Create missing ACOD index records in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER (#409.68)
    file
  - Delete the trigger cross reference (FTEXR) on the POSITION ASSIGNMENT
    HISTORY (404.52) file FTEE EQUIVALENT (#.09) field
  - Create two records in the TEAM PURPOSE (#403.47) file
    - PRIMARY CARE - NVCC
    - PRIMARY CARE - HBPC
  
 A new routine, SCMCOPT, was developed to place a number of PCMM legacy 
 menu options and a protocol out-of-order. The items to be placed
 out-of-order are listed below in the Options Associated and Protocols
 Associated sections. This routine also contains an entry point to change 
 the value in the SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS (#.01) field in the SECONDARY MENU
 OPTIONS (#203) multiple in the NEW PERSON (#200) file for users that 
 have the option SCMC PCMM GUI WORKSTATION to SCMC PCMMR WEB USER MENU. 
 Both entry points are called by the post-installation routine, SD53P603.
  
 A new routine, SCMCFPOS, was developed to fix the TEAM POSITION (#404.57) 
 file at sites that have deviated from the gold STANDARD POSITION (#403.46)
 file that is released with this patch.
