Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  The purpose of this patch is to correct Severity 1 and 2 defects that were
  reported in VS GUI v2.0.0.5 which was released to site Mirror accounts on 
  5/3/2016.
   
  This patch addresses the following issues:
   
 1. REQUEST/CONSULTATION entries that are linked to appointments which are in
    a cancelled or no-show state are not displaying in VS GUI.
 2. REQUEST/CONSULTATION entries that have a FILE ENTRY DATE that is older 
    Than 365 days should not be displaying in VS GUI.
 3. The last clinic availability time for a given day is not displaying in 
    The VS GUI Request Management grid.
 4. The VS GUI Clinic Schedule does not update slot counts correctly when
    appointments are booked on a day that has a partial clinic availability
    cancellation.
 5. Walk-in appointments turn green when checked in when they should stay 
    Blue to indicate it is a walk-in.
 6. Users can't overbook appointments between clinic start time and first
    available appointment in the VS GUI.
 7. VS GUI is displaying the wrong patient when using the Clinic Group 
    feature.
 8. The VS GUI Clinic report is displaying Stop Code Internal Entry Number 
    (IEN) instead of Stop Code number.
 9. VS GUI does not display a consult in scheduled status in the Request 
    Management grid when there has never been an appointment scheduled into 
    the same stop code between yesterday Today (T-1) or into the future. 
 10. Availability display in VS GUI does not match VistA when appointments are
     cancelled in VistA.
 11. The initial Request Management grid does not display all consults for a 
     patient, but when you search by patient it shows them all.
 12. In VS GUI, the appointment remained PINK when user performed the UNDO No
     Show action in VistA.
 13. When making an appointment against a consult in VS GUI, the LAST ACTION
     TAKEN field (#9) in the REQUEST CONSULTATION file was not updated in the
     same way that it is from VistA.
 14. When cancelling a consult appointment in VS GUI, the New Activity Text 
     in the COMMENT is not complete when compared to a consult appointment 
     that was cancelled via VistA.
 15. A consult that is <365 days old with Wait Time of >= 90 days does not 
     get included in the initial Request Management grid when the appointment 
     linked to it is cancelled or no-showed.
 16. When a partial clinic availability cancellation is performed on a day 
     that has appointments scheduled and has an overbook outside the available
     slots, the VS GUI displays grey with hash outside the range that was
     cancelled.  
 17. There is an issue with the 90 minute clinic partial cancellation, clinic 
     is partially cancelled from 0900-1030.  VS GUI shows cancellation for 
     0900-0930 only (grey with hash) and greyed out the rest 0930-1030. 0930-
     1030 should be displaying in grey with hash.
 18. When performing a Recall query for specific clinic(s), the results
     include recalls that have no clinic attached to it.
 19. A flag was added on the appointment conflict to handle Telehealth and 
     Chart Check appointments
 20. Appointment color indication does not get updated when performing Undo
     functionality in Clinic Group  (e.g. Undo Check in, Undo Check Out, 
     etc). Also, unable to select Undo Check-in once the Walk-in appointment 
     has been checked-in.
 21. VS GUI hangs when selecting an unscheduled appointment that was placed 
     in VistA
 22. VS GUI does not display availability if it starts at 805am.
 23. The VSE Veteran Appointment Request (VAR) Application Certificate Expired
 24. Move VS GUI trace.log from Program Files (x86) to Program Data and 
     update the VS GUI shortcut icon permissions.
 25. The blue color that is being used to annotate a Walk-In appointment is 
     so dark that the users can't see the information.

  Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
  --------------------------------------------
   
 1. I8720696FY16 - In the VS GUI, consults that have been cancelled by clinic
                   or no-showed are not displaying in the VS GUI Request
                   Management grid.
   
   Problem:   
   ----------
   REQUEST/CONSULTATION entries that are linked to appointments in a cancelled
   or no-show state are occasionally not displaying in VS GUI Request
   Management grid.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   In order to resemble VistA processing, the Request Management Grid has been
   corrected to look in the COMMENT field (#5) of the REQUEST PROCESSING
   ACTIVITY multiple field (#40) of the REQUEST/CONSULTATION file (#123) for
   the expected keyword of 'no-show' for No-shows and 'cancel' for cancelled
   appointments. This is also implemented for the 'AG' cross-reference of the
   REQUEST/CONSULTATION file (#123) in patch GMRC*3.0*86.
   
 2. I8754980FY16 - Consults greater than 365 days old should not show up in the
                   VS GUI Request Management grid.
    
   Problem:
   -------
   Entries from the REQUEST/CONSULTATION file (#123) are being displayed in
   VS GUI even if the FILE ENTRY DATE field (#.01) of the
   REQUEST/CONSULTATION file (#123) is older than 365 days.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   a. The Request Management grid has been modified to NOT display Consult 
      Requests that are greater than 365 days old at application startup.
  
   b. The Query Tool has been updated to not return Consults > 365 days, even
      if they are requested.
   
 3. I9206435FY16 - The last clinic availability time for a given day is not
                   displaying in the VS GUI Request Management grid.
    
   Problem:
   -------
   The last available time for a clinic for a given day is not displaying in
   the VS GUI Request Management grid due to a fix for partial clinic
   availability cancellations.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   This has been corrected by updating the SDEC APPSLOTS Remote Procedure Call
   (RPC) to better distinguish between a clinic that has a partial clinic
   availability cancellation and a clinic that does NOT have any partial clinic
   availability cancellations.
   
 4. I9314124FY16 - The VS GUI clinic schedule does not update slot counts
                   correctly when appointments are booked on a day that has
                   partial clinic availability cancellation.
    
   Problem:
   -------
   The VS GUI clinic schedule does not update slot counts correctly when
   appointments are booked on a day that has partial clinic availability
   cancellation.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   This issue was found to also be related to partial clinic cancellation. The
   times that were being scheduled were valid and not part of the partial
   clinic cancelled time. The SDEC APPSLOTS RPC was using the CAN node
   (previous pattern) instead of the current pattern from the HOSPITAL LOCATION
   file (#44). This has been corrected.
  
 5. I8674527FY16 - Walk-in appointments turn green when checked in when it
                   should stay blue to indicate it is a walk-in.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   When creating a walk-in appointments in VS GUI, the appointment turns green
   if the appointment is checked-in. The appointment needs to remain blue to
   indicate it is a walk-in. 
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Corrected the display logic for checked-in walk-in appointments.
   
 6. I8674132FY16 - Users can't overbook appointments between clinic start time
                   and first available appointment in the VS GUI.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   Users cannot overbook appointments between clinic set hour start time and
   the first availability defined in VS GUI.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Modified overbook logic to test the target appointment time is after the
   clinic start time for the day.
   
 7. I9609508FY16 - VS GUI is displaying the wrong patient when using the Clinic
                   Group feature.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   When using the clinic group feature in VS GUI a patient will become stuck in
   the cache. The user can change the patients but the patient in the cache
   will override the entry. Users think they are scheduling an appointment for
   Patient A but the appointment will be scheduled for Patient B (cache).
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Disabled TimeSlotViewer event handling for Clinic Group/Provider Schedule.
   
 8. R9460435FY16 - The VS GUI Clinic Report is displaying stop code IEN instead
                   of stop code.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   VS GUI is returning the ID pointer to the CLINIC STOP file (#40.7) instead
   of the stop code number.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   This has been corrected by changing the SDEC REP1GET RPC to return the stop
   code number instead of the stop code id in the 8th return piece.
   
 9. I8722975FY16 - VS GUI does not display a consult in the Request Management
                   grid when there has never been an appointment scheduled into
                   the same stop code between yesterday (T-1) or into the
                   future.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   If the consult status is "Scheduled", the consult should not display in the
   Request Management Grid if there is an appointment scheduled into a clinic
   that has the same stop code between yesterday (T-1) or into the future.
   If that appointment has been cancelled or no showed then the consult needs
   to display in the Request Management grid if it is less than 365 days old.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The issue was caused by the consult check routine which does not check to
   see if the appointment has been cancelled/no-showed. This has been
   corrected.
   
 10. I8915952FY16 - Availability display in VS GUI does not match VistA when
                    appointments are cancelled in VistA.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   When a partial day cancellation is performed on a clinic that is set up to
   display in 30 minute increment, the clinic schedule switches to a 15 minute
   increment and the hours of cancellation are over the specified range of
   hours that have been cancelled.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SDEC APPSLOTS has been modified to look for the "CAN" node which will
   contain the previous pattern before the cancel.
   
 11.  R9839712FY16 - VSE VAR Application Certificate Expired
   
   Problem:
   -------
   The VSE VAR application certificate was issued for 1 year
   (6/30/2015-6/29/2016).
   
   Resolution:
   ---------
   The same certificate has been reactivated.
   
 The following defects were encountered and corrected during internal SQA
 testing or User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
   
 PW_025 - The initial Request Management grid does not display all consults for
          a patient, but when you search by patient it shows them all.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   There were consults that did not get included in the initial load of data in
   the Request Management grid. The consults are in the correct statuses thus
   were expected to be included in the initial sets of data.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SDECRMG RMG RPC and the SDEC IDX Refresh option have been modified to
   only allow consults that are not older than 365 days old.
   
 PW_052 - In VS GUI, the appointment remained PINK when user performed the UNDO
          No Show action in VistA.
   
   Problem: 
   -------
   When UNDO No show is performed in VistA, the appointment in VS GUI still
   displays in pink.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SDAM routine for VistA that supports reversing a No-show appointment has
   been modified to update the SDEC APPOINTMENT file to indicate the No-show.
   
 PW_004 - When making an appointment against a consult in VS GUI, the LAST
          ACTION TAKEN field (#9) in the REQUEST CONSULTATION file was not
          updated in the same way that it is from VistA.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   When an appointment is booked via VS GUI, the Last Action field in the
   Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Consult does not reflect the
   correct status.  It still says "CPRS RELEASE ORDER" when it should say
   "Scheduled".
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The LAST ACTION TAKEN field in the REQUEST/CONSULTATION field (#123) was not
   being updated by the SDEC APPADD RPC. This has been corrected.
   
 PW_005 - When cancelling a consult appointment in VS GUI, the New Activity
          text in the COMMENT is not complete when compared to a consult
          appointment that was cancelled via VistA.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   When an appointment is cancelled either by Clinic or Patient in VS GUI, in
   the Activity of the Consult, the clinic information and date/time of
   appointment is getting deleted.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SDEC APPDEL RPC has been updated to properly include the clinic
   information and the date/time of appointment.
   
 PW_027 - A consult that is <365 days old with Wait Time of >= 90 days does not
          get included in the initial Request Management grid when the
          appointment linked to it is cancelled or no-showed.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   There were consults that did not get included in the initial load of data in
   the Request Management grid. The consults are in the correct statuses thus
   were expected to be included in the initial sets of data.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SDECRMG RMG RPC and the SDEC IDX Refresh option have been modified to
   only allow consults that are not older than 365 days old.
   
 PW_039 - When a partial clinic availability cancellation is performed on a day
          that has appointments scheduled and has an overbook outside the
          available slots, the VS GUI displays grey with hash marks outside the
          range that was cancelled.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   When a partial clinic availability cancellation is performed on a day that
   has appointments scheduled and has an overbook outside the available slots,
   the VS GUI displays grey with hash marks outside the range that was cancelled.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   SDEC APPSLOTS will now look for the "CAN" node which will contain the
   previous PATTERN before the Cancel. That "CAN" node will be used to
   determine where the X's should be to represent the time slots that had been
   cancelled. The results returned from SDEC APPSLOTS will match what it
   had previously done, however the slot counts will be replaced with an X.
   This resolves the issue with the Cancelled blocks going beyond the Cancelled
   time range. In the event that there is not a "CAN" node, an additional check
   has been added to the logic in SDEC APPSLOTS to not include cancelled blocks
   that go beyond the end of the cancelled time range. If cancelled blocks go
   beyond the end of the cancelled time, the display increment could still
   change from 30 to 15 minutes in GUI.
   
 PW_040 - There is an issue with the 90 minute clinic partial cancellation,
          clinic is partially cancelled from 0900-1030.  VS GUI shows
          cancellation for 0900-0930 only (grey with hash marks) and greyed out
          the rest 0930-1030. 0930-1030 should be displaying in grey with hash
          marks.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   There is an issue with the 90 minute clinic partial cancellation, clinic is
   partially cancelled from 0900-1030.  VS GUI shows cancellation for 0900-0930
   only (grey with hash marks) and greyed out the rest 0930-1030. 0930-1030
   should be displaying in grey with hash marks.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   SDEC APPSLOTS returns the "CAN" node that contains the previous PATTERN
   before the Cancel. The slot counts will be replaced with an X to match the
   previous pattern used.
   
 PW_044 - When performing a Recall query for specific clinic(s), the results
          includes recalls that have no clinic attached to it.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   The SDECRMG RMG RPC is incorrectly attempting to return Recall entries that
   do not have a Clinic defined.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   This has been corrected by limiting the returns from the SDEC RECGET and
   SDECRMG RMG RPCs to only those entries that have a clinic defined.
   
 PW_060 - Added flag on appointment conflict to handle Telehealth and Chart
          Check appointments.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   VS GUI needs to allow to book a Telehealth appointment even though a patient
   already has an existing appointment at the same time in a different clinic.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Added the "Is this appointment part of a Telehealth or Chart Check
   appointment pair?" question to the Conflicting Appointment dialog and
   converted it to a Yes\No confirmation.
   
 PW_055 - Appointment color indication does not get updated when performing
          Undo functionality in Clinic Group (e.g. Undo Check in, Undo Check
          Out, etc.).
   
   Problem:
   -------
   Walk-in Appointment color indication does not get updated when performing
   Undo functionality in Clinic Group (e.g. Undo Check in, Undo Check Out,
   etc.). Also, unable to select Undo Check-in once the walk-in appointment has
   been checked-in.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Updated appointment context menu enabling logic to allow editing of walk-In
   appointment. Fix also ensures the correct color is displayed on the screen
   based on appointment status.
   
 PW_058 - VS GUI hangs when selecting an unscheduled appointment that is made
          in VistA.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   In the SDEC APPOINTMENT file, the appointment end time is getting stored
   with the same value as the appointment begin time.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   This has been corrected in SDAMWI1 where the call to define the SDEC
   APPOINTMENT entry is made.
   
 PW_059 - VS GUI does not display availability if it starts at 0805am.
   
   Problem:
   -------
   The 60 and 30 minute display increments are only looking for availability
   starting on the 1/4 hour.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   This has been corrected by changing the SDEC APPSLOTS RPC to look at 5
   minute increments.
