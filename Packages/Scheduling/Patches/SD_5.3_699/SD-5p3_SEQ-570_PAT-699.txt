  - Informational

Description:
============

 VistA Scheduling (VS) Graphical User Interface (GUI) version 2.0.0.15 was
 found to contain a few defects upon production release that were not
 caught in earlier rounds of testing. A new release, VistA Scheduling GUI
 version 2.0.0.15.1, is being distributed via SCCM with fixes for these
 issues.
  
 These defects are GUI only. There is no new VistA patch associated with this
 GUI release, as it continues to use the VistA patch associated with the
 previous GUI release, SD*5.3*679.
  
 The corrected defects are as follows (with a workaround for dealing with each
 defect before the GUI update is applied):
 1. Appointment start time and duration
     a. Problem: During some overbooking and Multiple Return to Clinic (MRTC)
        actions a system bug will change the time of the new overbooked
        appointment to the earlier or later available slot (white space 
        on the clinic grid). It may be difficult for users to see and in
        some cases difficult or impossible to manually override.
        BE ALERT: This could cause confusion about appointment times for
        patients who are overbooked.
     b. Workaround:
           i. Schedulers should double check the start time of new
              overbooked and MRTC appointments very carefully.
          ii. When scheduling an overbook, put your cursor in the Start
              Time field and manually edit the appointment time.
         iii. If you need to overbook part of an MRTC series with a locked
              time slot, you can switch to VistA to make that particular
              appointment. This will require a manual disposition of
              "Removed/No Longer Necessary" of that MRTC child request in
              VS GUI.
 2. Calendar slots appearing open (white)
     a. Problem: If the user left clicks to select a slot in the calendar,
        additional white "slots" often appear in the calendar display. 
        This only changes the appearance of the calendar in VS GUI, it does
        not change the grid in VistA and does not affect whether a user can
        or cannot schedule into that slot.
     b. Workaround: Schedulers can clear out the residual white spaces by
        advancing the calendar forward/back, or putting their cursor into
        the clinic search box and hitting Enter.
 3. Appointment length when rescheduling in a variable length clinic
     a. Problem: Dragging a variable length appointment that has more than one
        slot associated with it to a new time will default the newly 
        scheduled appointment length to the minimum slot length (not the
        longer appointment length) when it is dropped.
     b. Workaround: You can continue to drag and drop for single slot
        appointments. For appointments that span multiple slots, the 
        scheduler will need to cancel and reschedule the appointment and 
        not drag and drop into a new slot.
 4. Appointment length when scheduling in a variable length clinic
     a. Problem: When the user highlights multiple slots in the schedule 
        to book an extended appointment in a variable-length clinic, and
        then right-clicks on any slot other than the last one in order to
        choose "Add Appointment", the system would book only the clicked
        slot instead of all selected slots.
     b. Workaround:
           i. To extend appointments, click the first slot, hold down Shift, and
              click the final slot to highlight the full duration needed.
          ii. Once you have the full length of the variable appointment
              selected, right click in the very bottom of your orange area, and
              select "Add Appointment" to get the full length to transfer into
              the Make Appointment box. If you click anywhere in the
              highlighted area outside of the very bottom, it will reduce the
              appointment duration to one slot.
         iii. Double check the appointment duration before hitting OK. If it is
              incorrect, use the drop-down duration to adjust OR go back to
              the calendar and reselect the extended period.
  
 All VistA sites shall install the VS PRODUCTION and TEST GUIs on
 all workstations using the CMCB package provided by SD. The TEST GUIs will
 be used to provide training to VS GUI users.
