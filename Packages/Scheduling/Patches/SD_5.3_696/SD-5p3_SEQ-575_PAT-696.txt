Description:
============

 Patch SD*5.3*696, provides Fiscal Year 2019 updates to the CLINIC STOP
 file (#40.7) as requested by the Office of Finance, Managerial Cost
 Accounting Office (MCAO).
  
  
                          *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
  
 This patch is being released with a compliance date of October 1, 2018,
 and should be installed as close to Close of Business (COB) on September
 30, 2018, as possible, but not after October 1, 2018. 
  
 Early installation of this patch could result in transmission of incorrect
 Stop Codes that will result in errors from Austin.  
  
 Coordination with the MAS (Medical Administration Service) PAS (Program 
 Application Specialist)/ADPAC (Automated Data Processing Application 
 Coordinator) is imperative as patch SD*5.3*696, will cause changes to the
 CLINIC STOP file (#40.7).
  
 Testing can be done in a site's mirror account before installation in 
 production to verify changes. Patch SD*5.3*696, modifies and creates Stop
 Codes effective October 1, 2018; therefore, installing early may modify
 certain Stop Codes that may currently be in use at your site.  It is
 advised that clinics with Stop Codes assigned that will incur restriction
 date/type changes should be corrected as soon as possible after
 installation. 
  
 Please keep in mind that new Stop Codes should not be assigned in 
 MAS/Scheduling until October 1, 2018, as the Patient Care Encounter (PCE)
 encounters bearing FY19 Stop Codes will not be accepted in Austin until 
 that date.  
  
 All other MAS Stop Code changes should be made as early as possible on 
 October 1, 2018.
  
                                    ***
  
 Instructions for the FY19 Stop Code Patch:
  
 Patch SD*5.3*696, makes additions and changes to the CLINIC STOP file
 (#40.7) as of October 1, 2018.
  
 No clinic can be created using any new Stop Codes contained in the patch 
 until after this patch is implemented.
  
  
 Scheduling staff & IRM should coordinate to perform the following
 sequence:
  
    1. IRMs should install the patch late on September 30, 2018 or early
       on October 1, 2018.
  
    2. Scheduling staff: Run the Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report 
       [SD CLN STOP CODE REP] to list those clinics that need changes in 
       the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) for FY19.
  
    3. Scheduling staff: Make changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44)  
       so that the clinics will have the correct Stop Codes in place for 
       October 1st clinic appointments.
  
  
 MCA Staff:
  
    1. Before October 1, 2018, (prior to installation of the patch) run
       Option 2: Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File [ECXSCLOAD] from the
       Setup for DSS Clinic Information menu [ECX SETUP CLINIC].
  
    2. Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract for September 
       2018. It is the create and edit, not the 'approve', that changes the
       values included in the CLI extract.  Perform normal AUDITS for the 
       CLI Extract.
  
    3. DO NOT make changes for October clinics at this time.  
  
    4. Between October 12 and 31, after auditing and receiving confirmation
       of successful deblocking of the transmitted September CLI Extract, 
       proceed with FY19 Stop Code changes to the DSS Clinics and Stop 
       Codes Worksheet:
  
       a. After the September extract has been ran, transmitted and is 
          considered final (in your mind, no re-run/re-transmit needed), 
          you may run Option 2 CREATE DSS Clinic Stop Code File 
          [ECXSCLOAD].
   
          This option creates local entries in the CLINICS AND STOP CODES 
          file (#728.44) and compares this file to the HOSPITAL LOCATION 
          file (#44) to see if there are any differences since the last 
          time the file was reviewed.
  
       b. After Option 2 has completed, use the Option 3:  Clinics and DSS
          Stop Codes Print [ECXSCLIST].  This option produces a worksheet 
          of (A) All Clinics, (C) Active, (I) Inactive, or only the (U)
          Unreviewed Clinics that are awaiting approval.
  
       c. Run Option 7:  Clinic & Stop Codes Validity Report [ECX STOP CODE
          VALIDITY].  This step will check that all Stop Codes conform. 
  
          Note: A 'blank' output indicates there are no problems with Stop
          Code and credit stop validity.
  
       d. Update for FY19 as needed using Option 4:  Enter/Edit Clinic 
          Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] option.
  
       f. Approve changes using Option 5:  Approve Reviewed DSS Clinic 
          Worksheet [ECXSCAPPROV] option.  Finalize all Stop Code changes  
          on the worksheet to be ready to run the October DSS CLI Extract.
