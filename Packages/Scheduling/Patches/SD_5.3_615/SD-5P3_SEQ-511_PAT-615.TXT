Description:
============

 This patch provides Fiscal Year 2015 updates to the CLINIC STOP 
 file (#40.7) as requested by the Office of Finance, Managerial Cost
 Accounting Office (MCAO).
  
                         *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 **************************************************************************
 ** This patch should be installed as close to COB on September 30, 2014 **
 ** as possible, but not after the start of business on October 1, 2014. **
 ** Early installation of this patch could result in transmission of     **
 ** incorrect stop codes that will result in errors from Austin.         **
 ** Coordination with the MAS (Medical Administration Service) PAS       **
 ** (Program Application Specialist)/ADPAC is imperative, as the patch   **
 ** will cause changes to the CLINIC STOP file (#40.7). Testing can be   **
 ** done in a site's mirror account before installation in production to **
 ** verify changes.                                                      **
 **                                                                      **
 ** This patch inactivates, creates and modifies descriptions of stop    **
 ** codes effective October 1, 2014, therefore, installing early may     **
 ** modify certain stop codes that may currently be in use at your site. **
 ** It is advised that clinics with stop codes assigned that will incur  **
 ** restriction date/type changes should be corrected as soon as         **
 ** possible after installation. Please keep in mind that new stop code  **
 ** corrections cannot be assigned until October 1, 2014. All other stop **
 ** code corrections should be made as early as possible on October 1,   **
 ** 2014. Sites need to coordinate their DSS CLINICS AND STOP CODES file **
 ** (#728.44) worksheet maintenance to save the latest FY2014 values     **
 ** (as of September 30, 2014), and then not change the worksheet to     **
 ** have FY2015 values until after the DSS Clinic (CLI) extract for      **
 ** September data has run successfully.                                 **

 MCA Site Team Instructions for FY15 Stop Code Patch (SD*5.3*615)
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 This patch makes additions and changes to the CLINIC STOP (Stop Code) 
 (#40.7) file as of October 1, 2014.
  
 - No clinic can be created using any new or reactivated Stop Codes 
   contained in the patch until after this patch is implemented.
  
 - Any clinics using a Stop Code inactivated by the patch should have an
   active Stop Code assigned. Assigning appropriate active Stop Codes to
   clinics can be accomplished prior to patch implementation if desired.
  
 MCA Site Teams, Scheduling and IRM should coordinate to perform the 
 following sequence:
  
 1) Run the DSS worksheet option CREATE DSS CLINIC STOP FILE. Then, 
    make any necessary adjustments before approval so all clinics on the
    worksheet have setups applicable for the month of September 2014.
  
 2) IRM installs the patch late on September 30 or early on October 1, 
    2014.
  
 3) Run the NONCONFORMING STOP CODES CLINIC REPORT to list those clinics
    that need changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file for FY15. Work
    with Scheduling staff to make changes in file (#44) so that the clinics
    will have the correct stop codes in place for October 1st clinic
    appointments. DO NOT make changes using Enter/Edit DSS Stop Codes for
    Clinics (file #728.44) at this time.
  
 4) Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract for September 2014.
    Updates should not be made for October stop code changes with the
    ENTER/EDIT DSS STOP CODES FOR CLINICS option prior to running the 
    September CLI Extract. Perform normal AUDITS for the CLI Extract.
  
 5) After auditing the September CLI Extract proceed with FY15 Stop Code
    changes to the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes Worksheet clinics:
  
    a. Run the CREATE DSS CLINIC STOP CODE FILE option. This option 
       creates local entries in the DSS CLINIC AND STOP CODES file 
       (#728.44) and compares file #728.44 to the HOSPITAL LOCATION file
       (#44) to see if there are any differences since the last time the
       file was reviewed.
  
    b. Use the option CLINICS AND DSS STOP CODES PRINT. This option 
       produces a worksheet of (A) All Clinics, (C) Active, (I) Inactive, 
       or only the (U) Unreviewed Clinics that are awaiting approval.
  
    c. Update for FY15 as needed using the ENTER/EDIT DSS STOP CODES FOR 
       CLINICS.
  
    d. Approve changes using the APPROVE REVIEWED DSS CLINIC WORKSHEET 
       option. Finalize all Stop Code changes on the worksheet to be ready 
       to run the October DSS CLI Extract.
