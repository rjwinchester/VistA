Description:
============

 This patch provides Fiscal Year 2016 Mid-Year updates to the CLINIC STOP 
 (#40.7) file as requested by the Office of Finance, Managerial Cost 
 Accounting Office (MACO).
  
                         *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 **************************************************************************
 ** This patch is being released with a compliance date of April 1, 2016.**
 ** This patch should be installed as close to Close of Business (COB)   **
 ** on March 31, 2016 as possible, but not after April 1, 2016. Early    **
 ** installation of this patch could result in transmission of incorrect **
 ** Stop Codes that will result in errors from Austin. Coordination with **
 ** the MAS (Medical Administration Service) PAS (Program Application    **
 ** Specialist)/ADPAC (Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator)**
 ** is imperative as the patch will cause changes to the CLINIC STOP     **
 ** (#40.7) file. Testing can be done in a site's mirror account before  **
 ** installation in production to verify changes. This patch inactivates **
 ** and modifies Stop Codes effective April 1, 2016; therefore installing**
 ** early may modify certain Stop Codes that may currently be in use     **
 ** your site. It is advised that clinics with Stop Codes assigned that  **
 ** will incur restriction date/type changes should be corrected as soon **
 ** as possible after installation. Please keep in mind that new Stop    **
 ** Code corrections should not be assigned in MAS/Scheduling until      **
 ** April 1, 2016 as PCE encounters bearing FY16 Mid-Year Stop Codes     **
 ** will not be accepted in Austin until that date. All other MAS Stop   **
 ** Code corrections should be made as early as possible on April 1,     **
 ** 2016.                                                                **

        MCA (Managerial Cost Accounting) Sites Team Instructions for 
                       FY16 Mid-Year Stop Code Patch:
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 This patch makes modifications to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file as of April
 1, 2016.
  
 No Clinic can be created using any new Stop Codes contained in the patch
 until after this patch is implemented. Any clinics using a Stop Code
 inactivated by the patch should be replaced with a new clinic using an
 active Stop Code. This can be accomplished prior to patch implementation
 if desired.
  
 MCA Site Teams, Scheduling, and IRM (Information Resource Management) 
 should coordinate to perform the following sequence:
  
   1. Run the DSS worksheet Option 2: Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File 
      [ECXSCLOAD] option. Then, make any necessary adjustments before
      approval so all clinics on the worksheet have setups applicable for
      the month of March 2016.
  
   2. IRM installs the patch late on March 31 or early on April 1, 2016.
  
   3. Run the Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report [SD CLN STOP CODE 
      REP] option to list those clinics that need changes in the HOSPITAL
      LOCATION (#44) file for FY16 Mid-Year. DO NOT make changes using
      Option 4: Enter/Edit Clinic Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] option
      for the CLINICS AND STOP CODES (#728.44) file at this time. Work with
      Scheduling staff to make changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file
      so that the clinics will have the correct Stop Codes in place for
      April 1st clinic appointments.
  
   4. Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract and ECS 
      Extract for March 2016. Do not edit clinic changes for April Stop
      Code changes with Option 4: Enter/Edit Clinic Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] 
      option or in DSS Unit Setup Screens in Event Capture prior to 
      running the March CLI Extract. It is the edit, not the "approve" that
      changes the values included in the extract. Perform normal AUDITS for
      the CLI Extract.
  
   5. After auditing and receiving confirmation of successful 
      deblocking of the transmitted March CLI Extract, proceed with FY16 
      Mid-Year Stop Code changes to the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes 
      Worksheet clinics and in any DSS Units set to Send No Records to PCE.
  
   6. For FY16 Mid-year:
  
      a. Run Option 2: Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File [ECXSCLOAD] option.
         This option creates local entries in the CLINICS AND STOP CODE
         (#728.44) file and compares this file to the HOSPITAL LOCATION
         (#44) file to see if there are any differences since the last time
         the file was reviewed.
  
      b. Use the Clinics and DSS Stop Codes Print [ECXSCLIST] option.
         This option produces a worksheet of (A) All Clinics, (C) Active,
         (D) Duplicate, (I) Inactive, (U) Unreviewed Clinics, or only 
         the (X) Export to Text File for Spreadsheet Use that are awaiting
         approval.
  
      c. Update for FY16 Mid-Year as needed using Option 4: Enter/Edit 
         Clinic Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] option.
  
      d. Approve changes using Option 5: Approve Reviewed DSS Clinic
         Worksheet [ECXSCAPPROV] option. Finalize all Stop Code changes on
         the worksheet to be ready to run the April DSS CLI Extract.
  
      e. Make needed Stop Code changes in Event Capture to DSS Units set to
         Send No Records to PCE.
