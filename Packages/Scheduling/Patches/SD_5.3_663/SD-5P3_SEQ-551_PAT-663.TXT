Description:
============

 NOTE:   Patch SD*5.3*663 (FY18 STOP CODE CHANGES) is being released
         along with Patch EC*2.0*136 (FY18 INACTIVE STOP CODE DSS 
         UNIT REVIEW) in host file: SD53_663_EC20_136.KID.
  
 Patch SD*5.3*663 provides Fiscal Year 2018 updates to the CLINIC
 STOP (#40.7) file as requested by the Office of Finance, Managerial
 Cost Accounting Office (MCAO).
  
 Patch EC*2.0*136 inactivates any DSS Units in Event Capture set to

                          *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 **************************************************************************
 *  These patches are being released with a compliance date of October 1, *
 *  2017 and should be installed as close to Close of Business (COB) on   *
 *  September 30, 2017 as possible, but not after October 1, 2017. Early  *
 *  installation of this patch could result in transmission of incorrect  *
 *  Stop Codes that will result in errors from Austin. Coordination with  *
 *  the MAS (Medical Administration Service) PAS (Program Application     *
 *  Specialist)/ADPAC (Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator) *
 *  is imperative as Patch SD*5.3*663 will cause changes to the CLINIC    *
 *  STOP (#40.7) file. Testing can be done in a site's mirror account     *
 *  before installation in production to verify changes. Patch SD*5.3*663 *
 *  inactivates and creates Stop Codes effective October 1, 2017;         *
 *  therefore, installing early may modify certain Stop Codes that may    *
 *  currently be in use at your site. It is advised that clinics with     *
 *  Stop Codes assigned that will incur restriction date/type changes     *
 *  should be corrected as soon as possible after installation. Please    *
 *  keep in mind that new Stop Codes should not be assigned in            *
 *  MAS/Scheduling until October 1, 2017 as the PCE encounters bearing    *
 *  FY18 Stop Codes will not be accepted in Austin until that date.       *
 *  All other MAS Stop Code changes should be made as early as possible   *
 *  on October 1, 2017.                                                   *

 Instructions for the FY18 Stop Code Patch:
  
 Patch SD*5.3*663 makes additions and changes to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7)
 file as of October 1, 2017. Patch EC*2.0*136 inactivates any DSS Units
 in Event Capture set to Send No Records to PCE with an associated Stop 
 Code being inactivated by Patch SD*5.3*663. 
  
 No clinic can be created using any new Stop Codes contained in the patch
 until after this patch is implemented. Any clinic using a Stop Code
 inactivated by Patch SD*5.3*663 should be replaced with a new clinic
 using an active Stop Code. This can be accomplished prior to patch
 implementation if desired.
  
 MCA Site Teams, Scheduling and IRM should coordinate to perform the 
 following sequence:
  
 1. From the menu, Setup for DSS Clinic Information [ECX SETUP CLINIC], run
    the DSS worksheet Option 2:  Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File 
    [ECXSCLOAD]. Then, make any necessary adjustments before approval so
    all clinics on the worksheet have setups applicable for the month of
    September 2017.
  
 2. IRM installs the patch late on September 30 or early on October 1, 
    2017.
  
 3. Run the Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report [SD CLN STOP CODE REP]
    to list those clinics that need changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44)
    file for FY18.
  
    Scheduling staff: make changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file
    so that the clinics will have the correct Stop Codes in place for
    October 1st clinic appointments.
  
    MCA staff: DO NOT make changes using Option 4:  Enter/Edit Clinic
    Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] for the CLINICS AND STOP CODES (#728.44) file 
    at this time.
  
 4. Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract and ECS Extract
    for September 2017.  Do not edit clinic changes for October Stop Code
    changes with Option 4:  Enter/Edit Clinic Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] option
    or in DSS Unit Setup Screens in Event Capture prior to running the
    September CLI Extract. It is the edit, not the "approve", that changes
    the values included in the extract.  Perform normal AUDITS for the CLI
    Extract.
  
 5. After auditing and receiving confirmation of successful deblocking of
    the transmitted September CLI Extract, proceed with FY18 Stop Code
    changes to the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes Worksheet clinics and in any
    DSS Units set to Send No Records to PCE.
  
 6. For FY18:
  
    a. Queue Option 2:  Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File [ECXSCLOAD] to run
       on October 1, 2017.  This option creates local entries in the 
       CLINICS AND STOP CODES (#728.44) file and compares this file to the
       HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file to see if there are any differences
       since the last time the file was reviewed.
  
    b. After Option 2 has completed, use the Option 3:  Clinics and DSS
       Stop Codes Print [ECXSCLIST].  This option produces a worksheet of
       (A) All Clinics, (C) All Active Clinics, (D) Duplicate Clinics,
       (I) All Inactive Clinics, (U) Unreviewed Clinics that are awaiting
       approval and (X) Export to Text File for Spreadsheet.
  
    c. Run Option 7:  Clinic & Stop Codes Validity Report [ECX STOP CODE
       VALIDITY]. This step will check that all Stop Codes conform.  
       Note:  a 'blank' output indicates there are no problems with Stop
       Code and credit stop validity.
  
    d. Update for FY18 as needed using Option 4:  Enter/Edit Clinic 
       Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] option.
  
    e. Approve changes using Option 5:  Approve Reviewed DSS Clinic 
       Worksheet [ECXSCAPPROV] option.  Finalize all Stop Code changes on
       the worksheet to be ready to run the October DSS CLI Extract.
  
    f. Make needed Stop Code changes in Event Capture to DSS Units set to 
       Send No Records to PCE.
  
    g.  MCA teams with questions, please log a WonderDesk ticket through
        http://vaww.dss.domain.ext/helpdsktckt.asp or by sending an
        Outlook message to the VHA MCAO CSHD mail group.

 Software Retrieval:
 ===================
 Patch SD*5.3*663 & Patch EC*2.0*136 are combined in host file
 SD53_663_EC20_136.KID.
  
 Installation of this host file should be coordinated among the packages 
 affected since only one installation is necessary.
  
 Sites may retrieve the KIDS build in one of the following ways:
  
   1. The preferred method is to SFTP the file from 
      download.vista.domain.ext which will transmit the file from the
      first available SFTP server.
  
   2. Sites may also elect to retrieve the patch directly using Secure 
      File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
      from the server as follows:
  
      Hines             domain.ext
      Salt Lake City    domain.ext 
  
      Host File          File Name                 SFTP Protocol
