 Problem:  
 -------
 It has been identified that SDRR CLEAN-UP job could potentially close a 
 Recall Reminder that should not be closed without review.  This could 
 potentially cause a patient to be lost to follow up care. Facilities are 
 actively changing their workflow to manually close/manage active Recalls 
 instead of relying on the SDRR CLEAN-UP job. This is a formal campaign at 
 the national level through the Office of Veteran Access to Care (OVAC), 
 and sites have been actively engaged to prepare for this workflow change.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Unschedule the SDRR CLEAN-UP job and do not reschedule it.   
 Sites/National Office can monitor the successful Unscheduling at each 
 site through a report on the VHA Support Service Center (VSSC) website. 
 The monthly "Auto-Routine" column statistics should be blank after a site 
 has unscheduled the SDRR CLEAN-UP job.  This report is open to anyone 
 behind the VA firewall at:

 Problem:  
 -------
 Instructions are needed for staff who are tasked to unschedule the SDRR 
 CLEAN-UP job. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Unscheduling this job uses the existing option Schedule/Unschedule 
 Options [XUTM SCHEDULE] as it is designed to be used.  This particular 
 job falls into the Scheduling (SD) namespace, but anyone who can 
 schedule/unschedule tasks with Taskman Management can perform this task.
  
 Navigate to Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM SCHEDULE].  It is located 
 under the Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] at most sites.

 1. Ensure you are looking at Option Name: SDRR CLEAN-UP on the first 
 line.  ***If you accidently chose SDRR TASK JOB, stop and start over.***
  
 2. Look at the information already entered.   You should see Option Name 
 and Menu Text filled in at the top.  If you do not have any information 
 in ANY prompt below the solid line under Menu Text, STOP, and skip to 
 end.  You just confirmed that the job is not scheduled at this site, and 
 no future action on your part is needed.  
  
 3. If you do see information in the prompts on the screen, use your down 
 arrow to put your curser into the first space of the first prompt that 
 contains information.  Type the @ sign (overwrites the first letter of 
 the current information) and Return.
  
 4. Repeat for each prompt that contains information.
  
 5. When you arrive at the last prompt, down arrow one last time to jump 
 to the COMMAND: prompt.  Enter S to save and E to exit. 
  
 6. Verify that the system took the change.  Reopen option 
 Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM SCHEDULE] and choose SDRR CLEAN-UP.  
 The information in each prompt should be blank (below).   If there is 
 information in any prompt, please repeat steps 2-5.
