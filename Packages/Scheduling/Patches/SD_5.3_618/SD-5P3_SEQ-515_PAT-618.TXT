 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 1. INC000000603057 - Patient appointment lists no longer print 
                      alphabetically
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When generating the Appointment List [SDLIST] & the Inpatient 
    Appointment List [SDAPP INPT] menu options, patients who have the same 
    appointment date and time in the same clinics, are not displaying in 
    alphabetical order.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines SDAL, SDAL0, and SDCIAL have been modified to sort patient 
    names alphabetically. This patch fixes Appointment List as well as
    Inpatient Appointment List.
  
 2. INC000000731055 - Description For Appointment Type Organ Donors
    
    Problem:
    --------
    The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) has requested that the Organ Donor 
    appointment type description needs to be updated to include
    non-veterans in the DESCRIPTION field (#10) of the APPOINTMENT TYPE
    file (#409.1).
  
    Current wording:
  
     DESCRIPTION: Exam of a veteran who wishes to be an organ donor to 
     determine if organ designated will be useable.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A post-install routine SD53P618 has been created to add the following 
    wording, "or non-veteran", to the DESCRIPTION field (#10) of the
    APPOINTMENT TYPE file (#409.1).
  
    The new description reads:
  
     DESCRIPTION: Exam of a veteran or non-veteran who wishes to be an
     organ donor to determine if organ designated will be useable.
  
 3. INC000000967362 - Update the length of clinic IEN number in PAIT
                      Documentation
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Since Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) has changed the 
    length of the Clinic IEN Number from 6 to 7 digits on their systems to 
    accept this value sent from VistA, VistA needs to update this
    information in the PAIT documentation.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    There is no coding change in VistA. The length of the data field Clinic
    IEN Number has been updated from 6 to 7 digits for the HL7 segment
    AIL.3.1 in the PAIT Technical Manual.
  
  
 Software and Documentation Distribution:

 ANONYMOUS,SOFTWARE directory from a specific server as follows:
