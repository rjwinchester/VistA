Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide posted on the 
 Anonymous directory for installation order. This is critical for proper 
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the implementation date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM)diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
 systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
 which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research.
  
 This patch implements the following changes to VistA Scheduling required
 to accommodate ICD-10-CM codes.
  
 1. For Scheduling related prompts, changed the labels to "ICD10" if 
 the Diagnosis date is after the implementation date and "ICD9" if the 
 diagnosis date is prior to the implementation date. For the Scheduling 
 prompts, where the diagnosis date is unavailable/not yet determined,
 the labels were changed to "ICD".
  
 2. For the 'Set Up A Clinic' option within VistA Scheduling, user is 
 allowed to add ICD-10 diagnosis codes prior to the implementation date. 
 The 'Set Up A Clinic' option also provides the ability to identify one
 primary default diagnosis from each of the code sets (ICD-9 or ICD-10).
  
 3. VistA Scheduling package provides an implementation checklist to 
 print from the Supervisor Menu that will help to ensure that ICD-10
 equivalent (if there are any) Default Diagnoses are set up for each clinic
 that had ICD-9 Default Diagnoses set up.
  
 4. After ICD-10 implementation date, user can add, edit and 
 store ICD-10 diagnosis codes (up to 8 characters including the decimal 
 point that follows the third character),ICD-10 diagnosis codes whereas 
 prior to implementation of ICD-10, they retain the ability to add, edit, 
 store ICD-9 diagnosis codes.
  
 5. The VistA Scheduling package provides the ability to sort and print
 the ICD-9 codes if the appointment dates are prior to ICD-10 implementation 
 date, and ICD-10 diagnosis codes if appointment dates are after the ICD-10 
 implementation date.
  
 6. The VistA Scheduling package provides the ability to select and 
 sort Provider/Diagnosis Report by ICD-9 diagnosis code when the beginning
 (appointment) date is prior to ICD-10 implementation date, and by ICD-10
 codes after the implementation of ICD-10. The labels for this report are
 also changed to "ICD9" or "ICD10" based on the ICD-10 implementation date.
  
 7. If beginning date is prior to implementation of ICD-10 and ending date 
 is after the implementation of ICD-10, the user is prompted to enter
 an ending date that is prior to implementation date of ICD-10 for ICD-9
 diagnosis codes.
  
 8. If appointment date is prior to ICD-10 implementation, "ICD9" label 
 is added to the Routing Slip Report. If the appointment date is
 after the ICD-10 implementation, "ICD10" label is added to the Routing
 Slip Report.
