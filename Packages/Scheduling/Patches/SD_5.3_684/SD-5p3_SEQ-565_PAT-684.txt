  1. R18206898FY18 - Identified an error in SDBuild in production - 
     Availability is restored in error
   
     Problem:
     --------
     When canceling a date through the Cancel Clinic Availability 
     [SDCANCEL] option that has previously been removed from availability
     through the Set up a Clinic [SDBUILD] option, the availability for
     that date will inadvertently be restored with the day's default 
     pattern if indefinite availability is enabled. This occurs because
     the Cancel Clinic Availability [SDCANCEL] option deletes the 
     PATTERN (#44.005) sub-file of the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file if
     the CURRENT AVAILABILITY (#44.005,1) sub-field pattern has no open
     slots.
    
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine SDC has been updated to remove the KILL command on the PATTERN
     (#44.005) sub-file of the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file. This prevents
     the availability grid from recreating the PATTERN (#44.005) sub-file
     with the default availability pattern.
