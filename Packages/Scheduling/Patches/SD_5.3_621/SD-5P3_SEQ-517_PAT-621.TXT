Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following five (5) Remedy tickets:
 1. Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT] allows entry of a desired date
    that's prior to the patient's date of birth or clinic availability.
 2. The Transmission History Report - Full [SCDX AMBCAR XMIT HIST FULL]
    option prints 'TRY LATER' when the output is directed to MailMan
    (P-MESSAGE) or a file/printer.
 3. The CLINIC SERVICES RESOURCES field (#29) in the HOSPITAL LOCATION 
    File (#44) points to a file that no longer exists.
 4. The *COMMUNICATION FORMAT field (#2007) in the HOSPITAL LOCATION 
    File (#44) points to a file that no longer exists.
 5. Appointments entered using a past date display the incorrect Scheduling
    Request Type.

 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 1. INC000000592781 - Desired dates allowed that are prior to DOB or clinic
                      availability
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When making an appointment in the Appointment Management options (see 
    below), a desired date that is  prior to the patient's date of birth (DOB)
    or clinic availability date is allowed.
        Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT]
        Make Appointment [SDM]
        Multiple Appointment Booking [SDMULTIBOOK]
        Make Consult Appointment [SC MAKE CONSULT APPOINTMENT]
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDM0 has been modified to call AVCHK^SDM1 to check if the desired
    date is prior to the patient's DOB. Also a call is made to AVCHK1^SDM1 to 
    check if the desired date is prior to the clinic's availability date.
  
  
 2. INC000000784133 - SCDX AMBCAR XMIT HIST FULL report not printing
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Transmission History Report - Full [SCDX AMBCAR XMIT HIST FULL] report
    does not print when the output is sent to MailMan (P-MESSAGE) or a 
    file/printer. The report's output is only viewable on the screen.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SCDXPRN2 has been modified to remove the call to routine 
    EN^XUTMDEVQ which handles the output device; to now allow the call EN1^DIP 
    which in turn calls the ^%ZIS entry point to handle the output device.
  
  
 3. INC000001004429 - Field (#29) in File (#44) points to non-existent file
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The CLINIC SERVICES RESOURCE Field (#29) in the HOSPITAL LOCATION 
    File (#44) points to the CLINIC SERVICES RESOURCE File (#403.12); a file
    that no longer exists. Additionally, when the CLINIC SERVICES RESOURCE
    File (#403.12) was deleted the DD for the file was not cleaned up well
    leaving the two nodes below.
  
        Global ^DD(403.12
        ^DD(403.12,.01,5,1,0)="44^.01^12"
        ^DD(403.12,"TRB",44,.01,12,.01)=""
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The data type for the CLINIC SERVICES RESOURCE Field (#29) was changed
    to free text. An asterisk (*) was added before the field name to indicate
    it's no longer used. Also, the technical description filed was updated 
    with the following:
        This field is no longer used. It was a pointer to the CLINIC SERVICES 
        RESOURCE File (#403.12) which no longer exists.
         
    Additionally, post-install routine SD53P621 removed the DD nodes from 
    the CLINIC SERVICES RESOURCE File (#403.12) that were not properly cleaned 
    up.

 5. INC000001015947 - Past date appt has incorrect Scheduling Request Type
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Appointments entered with a past date display the incorrect Scheduling
    Request Type.
    
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDM1A has been modified so that past appointments will have a
    Scheduling Request Type of 'O' FOR OTHER THAN 'NEXT AVA.' APPT.
