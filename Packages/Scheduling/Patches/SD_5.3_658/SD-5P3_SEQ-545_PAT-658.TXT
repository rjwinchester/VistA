Description:
============

 VS GUI v2.0.0.8 and this patch provide the 'Additional Enhancements' to the
 VistA Scheduling (VS) Graphical User Interface (GUI) v2.0.0.5 application
 which were requested by Office of Veteran Access to Care (OVAC), as well as
 fixes to 35 CA SDM tickets.  
  
 These additional enhancements will provide greater flexibility in the
 scheduling process, provide the ability to manage requests more efficiently
 and effectively, synchronize patient information between VS GUI and VistA
 Scheduling Legacy, improve the printing process, save time by cleaning up
 unresolved requests, contact patients for appointments more effectively and
 efficiently and improve performance.
  
 ENHANCEMENTS
  
 Epic #1-Grid Match and Unscheduled Appointments
 For VSE Schedulers who schedule a series of appointments for a Veteran. The
 solution provides the scheduler with the ability to schedule appointments at
 times and with the variations needed to support clinic operation, as well as
 identifying the exact appointment times for unscheduled patients/walk-ins.
 That helps provide greater flexibility in scheduling Veterans. Unlike the
 current system that does not offer the flexibility needed, our process
 increases availability and provides better tracking information.
  
 Epic #2-Edit and View Requests
 For VSE Schedulers who schedule appointments in VSE. The solution allows
 schedulers to manage requests more efficiently and effectively by editing
 requests, saving and viewing all comments, and re-opening requests as needed
 while always preserving the original preferred date (PD). That helps the
 scheduler make appointments for Veterans without having to create a new
 request and ensures that Veterans receive care when needed. Unlike the current
 system that will not allow the scheduler to edit some critical request
 information and will not re-open requests for no show and canceled by patient
 appointments, our process allows schedulers to more effectively view and edit
 requests, which will improve the accuracy and efficiency of the scheduling
 process. 
  
 Epic #3-Demographic Data Updates
 For VSE Schedulers who schedule appointments within VS GUI, the solution
 allows the scheduler to update information in VS GUI and the correct
 information will be updated in VistA. That helps the scheduler better serve
 the Veteran by making updates more efficiently and while making an appointment
 for the Veteran. Unlike the current system that forces the scheduler to move
 back and forth between VS GUI and VistA, reducing the likelihood that
 schedulers will want to use VS GUI and increasing the time to make changes,
 our process reduces the time the scheduler needs to update important Veteran
 demographic information because the scheduler can update the Veteran's
 demographic information while making appointments and without having to use
 the VistA system.
  
 Epic #5-CCOW and Patient Identification
 For VSE Schedulers who schedule appointments in VSE, the solution synchronizes
 the patient information across functional areas within VSE to the patient in
 focus and provides more information about a patient's identification in the
 calendar view of appointments. That helps the scheduler search for and view
 patient appointments more efficiently and consistently. Unlike the current
 process where the scheduler has to search on the patient in each application,
 independently, and doesn't have enough information for identifying
 appointments in the calendar, our process allows schedulers to more
 effectively manage appointments.
  
 Epic #7-Improved Printing
 For VSE Schedulers, providers, and patients who need to print or read printed
 schedules and scheduling letters (clinic cancellation, appointment
 cancellation, no-show, and pre-appointment), the solution enables improved
 printing of letters and printing of Veteran appointments. That provides
 printing of letters with visually effective formatting, no loss of
 information, and provides printing of appointments for Veterans -- unlike the
 current VSE system that has issues printing all types of letters and
 schedules. Our process improves the processes related to printing in VSE.
  
 Epic 9-Trash Queue Cleanup
 For administrators who need to identify and purge unresolved requests, the
 solution allows a task to be run to identify open appointment requests or
 duplicate appointment requests and close them, producing a report for
 administrators. Note: Excludes VAR requests which are called Veteran Request
 or Mobile and Welcome to VA (W2VA) requests - all stored in the SDEC APPT
 Request file. That helps the administrator by rectifying unresolved requests
 automatically. Unlike the current process where there are duplicate requests
 and unresolved requests that must be resolved by the administrator, our
 process saves schedulers and administrators time but still allows them to
 review closed duplicates and open requests.
  
 Epic 10- For VSE Schedulers who need to create and view Veteran, appointment,
 and clinic information in VSE, the solution allows the user to set their
 default view preferences and adds a view only option. That helps to improve
 scheduler efficiency, unlike the current VSE system that does not provide
 these features. Our process improves the processes used by schedulers and
 improves overall service to the Veteran.
  
 Epic  11-Veterans Appointment Request (VAR) Queue
 For VSE Schedulers who schedule appointments in VSE, the solution displays the
 telephone number that was entered into the VAR screen by the Veteran in the
 VAR queue. That helps to ensure the scheduler will be contacting the Veteran
 at the number they have provided, unlike the current process where the phone
 number entered into VAR does not display in VSE. Our process allows schedulers
 to more efficiently and effectively contact patients for appointments.
  
 Epic 13- For all VSE users who view, schedule, or manage information in VSE,
 the solution provides efficient and effective response time, displaying pick
 lists, query results, and reports real time and without performance issues
 such as white screens or a seemingly endless hourglass. That helps to ensure
 the scheduler is able to serve Veterans efficiently and effectively,
 maintaining good productivity. Unlike the current process that pulls up
 limited data, takes too long to pull up data, or results in white screens, the
 solution allows VSE to display pick lists in five (5) seconds or less. VSE
 informs user of progress during the generation of queries. Our process allows
 schedulers to more efficiently and effectively perform their jobs.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. I10691629FY16- User can select a different patient from the calendar
                   (PSPO 3242)
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When a user searches and selects a patient and clicks on an appointment in
   the calendar for a different patient, this action changes the patient in the
   Ribbon Bar to the new patient information but leaves the RM grid with the
   original patient.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The Client has been updated to redisplay both the Patient and Patient's
   Requests when an appointment is selected from the calendar.
  
 2. 11142558FY17- Comments in VS GUI do not work properly; there are
                  differences between VistA and VS GUI; includes NOTES &
                  Comments that are in different fields in the GUI  (PSPO 3306)
   
   Problem:
   -------
   Several clerks had noted that the comment system in VS GUI does not work
   properly compared to VistA.  Comments are appearing in different
   places or occasionally not at all. One clerk in particular was attempting to
   show the differences between VSE/VistA and we came across a comment
   "follow-up required within 7-10 days" that appeared in VistA but not VSE.
   This particular clinic may have over 300 interactions with patients per day
   so a comment like that getting lost could lead to follow-ups potentially
   being scheduled outside the requested window.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SDEC APPADD RPC has been updated to properly store the NOTE into the
   Patient's appointment record. The SDECADD routine has been updated to
   properly store to the NOTE multiple of the SDEC APPOINTMENT file (#409.84)
   when an appointment is added or updated from VistA.
  
 3. I10665102FY16- Availability does not zero out
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When an appointment is booked at 815-915am in VistA for a clinic that has
   availability from 0800-0900, in VistA the 8am slot still shows 1 and at
   815 it shows an *. In VS GUI, the slot still shows 1 from 8-9 and there is
   no *.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The client has changed the handling of the data returned from the SDEC
   APPSLOTS rpc to insure the corrected availability is displayed in the Clinic
   Schedule.
  
 4. I10320124FY16- Scheduling letters printed with the default font of 15 do
                   not print the information correctly on the page.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   Users want to be able to change the font size when printing letters and be
   able to set the default font size so they do not have to reset it every time
   an appointment letter is printed.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   A new PARAMETER DEFINITION (XPAR) has been added called SDEC DEFAULT FONT
   SIZE which will hold the default Font.
   Two new RPCs have been added - 
    - SDECU4 GETFONT allows the VS GUI to get the current default font size.
    - SDECU4 PUTFONT allows the VS GUI to set a new default font size to the
      new XPAR.
  
 5. I9982851FY16- VSE Grid displaying incorrect slot availability.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   There is an issue where several clinic grids are not displaying the correct
   slot availability.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The GUI client has been updated to correctly size the Appointment Time slots
   to display at the slot start time and over the duration of the slot.
  
 6. I10449686FY16- VS GUI displays too many slots for a 60min increment clinic.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   VS GUI displays too many slots for a 60min increment clinic. In VistA, users
   only see 1 slot per hour whereas in VS GUI users see 2 slots per hour
   (1 per 30min slot).
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The GUI client has been updated to correctly size the Appointment Time slots
   to display at the slot start time and over the duration of the slot.
  
 7. R10131762FY16- VS GUI Not Prompting for Overbook
  
   Problem:
   -------
   VS GUI does not follow the same rules as VistA when determining if a prompt
   for Overbook should occur.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   A new RPC has been added, SDEC57 OBM, which uses the same rules for
   determining when an overbook status has occurred and what message should be
   displayed to the user.
  
 8. I9871873FY16- VSE Calendar is not displaying the Overbook symbol beside the
                  overbook appointment.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When a Scheduling User has the SDMOB security key, that user can overbook
   appointments outside the scheduling grid hours. When the appointment is
   booked after the normal work hour, the overbook symbol is not present in the
   VSE GUI beside the appointment.
   Example: if a clinic is set up for working hours from 8am - 4pm and an
   overbook apt is made at 8pm - the VSE GUI the displays the patient name and
   appointment at the 8 pm slot but the overbook symbol is displayed at 5pm.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The GUI client has been updated to change the handling of the return from
   the SDEC APPSLOTS rpc to insure the overbook symbol is displayed in the
   Clinic Schedule.
  
 9. I10659119FY16- VSE is not displaying the RM GRID in the correct Priority
                   Order.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   The correct default sort is as follows:
     1. Requests with blank Priority Group
     2. Priority Group 1
        OR all patients whose request for care is SC related
        (Field #409.3,15 = YES).
        Display records with SCVisit=Yes first followed by SCVisit=Null.
     3. Priority Group 2 whose request for care is NOT SCVisit then Priority
        Group 3 and if Priority Group 3 is not SCVisit .. and so on.
     4. For ascending Priority Group order within each group, the system shall
        sort the requests by the desired date, and within each desired date,
        the system shall sort the requests by the date the request was made.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   For EWL and APPT request types, SC Related is determined by the SERVICE
   CONNECTED PRIORITY field. This field is found in both SD WAIT LIST and SDEC
   APPT REQUEST files.
   
   Note that Groups 2-8 are treated like GROUP 1 if SERVICE CONNECTED
   PRIORITY is 'YES', so they could end up mixed with no order to the
   GROUP. For Recall and Consults, SC Related is defined as if it were
   'YES' for GROUP 1 and Null for all others.
   
   '... for Recall and Consult for all other Priority groups it should be
   null. For Priority Group 1 it will be Yes.'
  
 10. I9674926FY16- The Patient Address is too high on the letter to fit into a
                   #10 standard one window envelope. 
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When printing patient letters from VS GUI, the Patient Address is too high
   on the letter to fit into a #10 standard one window envelope. When you print
   in VISTA to a network printer, it's fine.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   This has been found to be a Windows issue, therefore when printing letters
   that need to go into a #10 window envelope, these letters should be printed
   from within VistA.
  
 11. I10043597FY16- The length of the Special Needs and Preferences REMARKS
                    field in VS GUI is causing unresponsive system.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   There is a problem with the Remarks section in the special needs and
   preferences in VS GUI. If there are too many characters (no max set) the
   system will give the white screen and users will need to close out.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Although the REMARKS field (#6) of the SDEC PREFERENCES AND SPECIAL NEEDS
   file (#409.845) is a Word Processing field, the string coming in is being
   stored as only 1 line no matter how long it is. This could cause the entry
   to exceed the maximum allowed string length. This has been corrected by
   dividing the string into multiple lines with a maximum line size of 80
   characters.
  
 12. I10619212FY16- All requests in the VS Request Grid should open to TODAYs
                    Date when the CID/PD Date is in the PAST.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   All Request in the VS GUI Request Grid should open to TODAYs Date when the
   CID/PD Date is in the PAST. Currently the calendar opens to the CID/PD Date
   in the Request (APPT, EWL, RECALL, CONSULT). This is causing confusion at
   the sites and possible incorrect scheduling. Making all requests work the
   same way will eliminate confusion and possible incorrect scheduling.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The GUI client has been updated to open the calendar to Todays Date when the
   CID (preferred date) is in the past.
  
 13. I9937259FY16- Comments entered in the VS GUI APPT Request are not being
                   displayed when the Request is viewed and they are not
                   transferring to the EWL Request.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   The Comments field in the Appointment Dialog for VS GUI contains important
   information concerning the Appointment being requested. This comment is
   added to the APPT Request but is not being displayed when the user selects
   the VIEW REQUEST function from the request grid. Also, when the function to
   transfer the APPT Request to the EWL Request, the comments are not
   transferring to the EWL Request.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SDEC APPADD rpc has been updated to pass the comment all the way through
   to the appropriated Appointment Request, Patient Appointment, and Clinic
   Appointment.
  
 14. I10695144FY16- New or Established field is not calculating according to
                    Business Rules set by ACAP office.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   Currently the VS GUI is looking at the specific CLINIC but it should be
   looking at the Primary Stop Code of the Clinic to determine NEW or
   ESTABLISHED status. 
   Per Dr. Davies comment in the Issue Report - the definition of 'established'
   that we have in place now is simply those patients who have completed at
   least one appointment in a given stop code in the past 24 months. I agree
   that it is logical to use check out since I presume that is the data element
   indicates they have completed at least one appointment in the stop code.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SDEC PCST2GET rpc has been updated to use the Clinic Stop code in place
   of the Clinic id AND also has been updated to use the check-out time instead
   of the appointment time to determine if the patient is 'NEW' or
   'ESTABLISHED'.
  
 15. I11146466FY17- Need the ability to make a scheduled appointment at a time
                    that overlaps an already scheduled appointment.
                    (ex - Tele-Health)
  
   Problem:
   -------
   In the current VistA scheduling application the user is able to enter a
   scheduled appointment at a time that is not consistent with the allocated
   time slots.
   Example - A slot is allocated at the top hour with the appointment length
   of one hour at 9, 10, and 11. The user needs to make a scheduled appointment
   at 9:10. The VSE GUI needs to add the capability to enter the appointment
   time when scheduling an appointment. The entered appointment time must
   display accurately in the calendar grid.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The VS GUI client has been updated to allow booking and overlap appointment.
  
 16. I9883746FY16- MRTC not reflecting correct CID Date
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When cancelling an MRTC appointment, if the user selects cancel by patient
   and enters a different CID date, the Child request reopens with the original
   CID date. When the appointment is rescheduled the calendar opens to original
   CID date. And after scheduling the appointment and viewing the appointment
   details in Vista the CID date is showing the same date as the re-scheduled
   appointment date.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The GUI client has been updated to correct the MRTC process that was not
   reflecting the correct CID Date. When cancelling an appointment by patient
   that is part of an MRTC, and the the CID date is changed, the new CID date
   is not reflected in the re-opened appt request.
  
 17. I9654231FY16- Multi-Appointment booking in VSE GUI - incorrect CID being
                   passed to VistA
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When Multi-Appointments (MRTC) are booked in the VSE GUI. each appointment
   made has its own request with a calculated CID/Preferred Date. The
   CID/Preferred Date that is being set in VSE is not the same as what is being
   shown in VistA.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The GUI client has been updated to pass the correct CID to the SDEC APPADD
   rpc.
  
 18. I10573215FY16- Multiple Return To Clinic (MRTC) is allowing the clinic to
                    be changed to a clinic that is not within the same stop
                    code as the requested clinic
  
   Problem:
   -------
   In VS GUI, Multiple Return To Clinic (MRTC) is allowing the clinic to be
   changed to a clinic that is not within the same stop code as the requested
   clinic. This could result in the patient not getting the kind of
   care/appointment that the provider requested.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   A new rpc has been added called SDEC01 CLINICS which will return a list of
   clinics for a given CLINIC STOP code or that match a given clinic.
   The GUI client has been updated to use the new SDEC01 CLINICS rpc to fill
   the combo box with clinics having matching stop codes.
  
 19. 9883550FY16- If the user does not complete the steps when cancelling a
                  MRTC appointment, the appt is not completely cancelled.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   If the user does not complete the steps when cancelling a MRTC appointment,
   VSE is not cancelling all of the functions. This is allowing the user to
   attempt to start the cancellation over in the same transaction which is
   causing an error.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The GUI client has been updated to improve the flow of cancelling an MRTC
   appointment so that the cancellation is completed correctly.
  
 20. I9642120FY16- During the process of Multi-Book appointment booking, the VS
                   GUI hangs.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   There are times when VS GUI hangs during the process of adding a Multi-Book
   appointment. This seems to be due to unrecognized overbook messages.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The GUI Client has been updated to handle all overbook messages and removed
   the inappropriate messages.
  
 21. I9829412FY16- ENH REQ Approved: MULTIPLE APPOINTMENT BOOKING-SDMULTIBOOK
                   Option- Appts MADE in VistA Legacy are not reflected in VS
                   GUI.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   In MULTIPLE APPOINTMENT BOOKING - SDMULTIBOOK option - Appointments MADE in
   VistA are not showing in the calendar for VS GUI.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SDMULTIBOOK option has been updated to store the new appointment data
   into the SDEC APPOINTMENT file and to add an entry to the SDEC APPT REQUEST
   file when appropriate
  
 22. I9956180FY16- Edits made to request comments in VS GUI do not get sent to
                   VistA legacy.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   If a user edits the Notes field of the Appointment Dialog in VS GUI, the
   edit is not sent to VistA. The Notes field of the Appointment
   Cancel dialog also is not sent to VistA. The appointment request
   will reopen on the request grid and the comments will not reflect the
   edit, only the original notes entered when the initial creation of the
   appointment was performed.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SDEC EDITAPPT RPC has been updated to store the edited Note to the
   Clinic Appointment record.
  
 23. I9568671FY16- VS GUI should be updated to always show the CID Date on the
                   RM Grid for Consults.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   GMRC*3*81 made changes to some fields that VS GUI is referencing and VS GUI
   needs to be updated. The VS GUI should always show the CID Date found in
   the Consult. This will need to be coded to start this process as of the
   compliance date of the patch. Current requirements are - In OT3, there
   is a requirement for Consult that If the 'Entered Date' and 'Earliest
   Appropriate Date' (both from the Consult in CPRS) are equal to each other
   then VS GUI shall use the 'Urgency' field for CID unless the Urgency field
   is equal to 'Stat' or 'Next Available', 'Emergency' or 'Today' then use
   'Earliest Appropriate Date' as the CID.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SDEC REQGET RPC has been updated to check that GMRC*3.0*81 has been
   installed on or before the File Entry Date (and time). If so, we always
   return the 'EARLIEST DATE' (CLINICALLY INDICATED DATE) as the 9th return
   piece (PRIO). If GMRC*3.0*81 has not been installed by the FILE ENTRY DATE,
   we execute the same logic as before, which is:
    If the 'Entered Date' and 'Earliest Appropriate Date' (both from the
    Consult in CPRS) are equal to each other then VS GUI will use the
    'Urgency' field for CID unless the Urgency field is equal to 'Stat' or
    'Next Available', 'Emergency' or 'Today' then use 'Earliest Appropriate
    Date' as the CID.
  
 24. I9381748FY16- Query for Recall results with black screen and application
                   freezing.  
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When using the Query Tool in VS GUI to submit a data request that includes
   a clinic filter causes the screen to go black and there is a delay of 2-3
   minutes before the results are returned.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   This has been addressed in the SDEC RECGET RPC by using the existing E xref
   in the RECALL REMINDERS file (#403.5) to look up by Clinic when a Clinic ID
   is included in the filters.
  
 25. I9878547FY16- VSE keeps freezing at many points from log in to well within
                   the program.  
  
   Problem:
   -------
   VS GUI freezes and displays a white or black screen at various points in the
   application.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Additional cross-references have been added to some of the VS GUI related
   files along with support from the VS GUI related APIs to speed up searches
   from the RM Grid.
   The GUI Client has been updated to use multi-threading for several processes
   that tend to take more time than is acceptable.
  
 26. I11145711FY17- Consults are to be displayed in the RM Grid regardless of
                    the request date
  
   Problem:
   -------
   All Pending Consults should be displayed in the RM GRID regardless of the
   Request Date.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The 365 day restriction has been removed from the SDEC REQCHK and
   SDECRMG RMG RPCs.
  
 27. I10612450FY16- Calendars in the Schedules Section do not sync together
  
   Problem:
   -------
   In VS GUI, if the user is viewing/selecting clinics in the Clinic Schedules
   versus selecting a request type and changes clinics, whatever date the
   previous clinic was on will remain showing in the calendar on the left. The
   grid and calendar located in the grid will default to today's date.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The GUI Client has been updated to correct the calendar sync when the user
   changes clinics and when the CID is in the past.
  
 28. I10645706FY16- Month View in Schedules Section is not functioning properly
  
   Problem:
   -------
   Changing to a Month View and then selecting the triangle within the day
   slot, opens the wrong date.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The GUI Client has been corrected to display the correct date when selecting
   the triangle within the day slot.
  
 29. I10659319FY16- VS GUI is not reflecting the SC Related field in the RM
                    GRID correctly.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   In the VS GUI the SC Related field on the RM Grid is not reflecting the
   SERVICE CONNECTED PRIORITY field of the VS GUI Request.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SCVisit value was not getting updated when the record was read going
   into the Request Management screen.  This has been corrected.
  
 30. I10644445FY16- Editing an Appt Request leaves Clinic/Service field blank
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When editing an appointment request the clinic/service field is blank when
   the Appointment Request box opens. Matching clinic names are appearing in a
   separate window outside of the appointment request box versus under the
   clinic/service box. The box allows the user to highlight a clinic name but
   the name does not populate the clinic/service field. 
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The GUI Client has been updated to properly display the data in the
   clinic/service field AND when selecting a clinic, the matching clinic names
   display under the clinic/service box as expected.
  
 31. I10371353FY16- Address in the New Appointment block under the Contact Tab
                    is displaying the Next Of Kin -  city, state, zip instead
                    of patient address information
  
   Problem:
   -------
   The Address that is in the Contact Information in the Add Appointment dialog
   is not the same as the one that displays in the demographics area. Further
   researched shows that the Contact Information is pulling the Address from
   the Next Of Kin address. Team is evaluating to determine if this was a
   requirement or a potential enhancement request.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The GUI Client has been updated to pull the correct patient address data for
   the Contact Information and the Demographics area.
  
 32. I10046473FY16- Large Amount of Characters in Notes Section causes an error
                    in VS GUI Appt Remarks after entering an Appt
  
   Problem:
   -------
   In the Notes field of New Appointment dialog the user/scheduler can enter
   3000+ characters; however, the text is filing to Other field of the
   Appointment Sub-file and that field is limited to only 150 characters of
   text.
   
   If the scheduler does add a large amount of text then VS GUI will
   register an unable to load dialog error when OK is selected in New
   Appointment dialog and the application will freeze up.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Modified New Appointment dialog to limit Notes to 150 characters.
  
 33. I9961448FY16- Entering a "^" when creating an appointment request in VS
                   GUI causes a table error box and user cannot correct.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   VistA does not allow the use of this symbol '^' when entering comments
   into the other field inside of appointment management. However it will
   notify and allow the user to re-enter the comments.
   
   When using this symbol in VS GUI in an appointment request, a table error
   box is received and the user is not given the opportunity to correct.
   The request completes and comments are not reflected.
   
   When using this symbol while scheduling an appointment, in the Notes the
   user is given the table error. The user is not given the opportunity to
   correct. The new appt box closes. Pending appointments show the
   scheduling appt however the user is not able to select the appt to
   display the grid or choose that clinic date using the scheduling section
   and manually entering the clinic and selecting the day on the calendar.
   The grid appears grayed out and the same table error is received.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SDEC WLSET, SDEC ARSET, and SDEC RECSET RPCs have been updated to check
   for these ^ characters during input validation. If the ^ character is
   detected, it is changed to a space.
  
 34. I10644588FY16- Viewing EWL Request is not displaying Clinic/Service field
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When viewing an EWL Request the Clinic/Service field is not populated.  This
   issue is happening because the first part of the clinic name is the same for
   multiple clinics.  For example, CHY ORTHO PECKHAM, CHY ORTHO PECKHAM RETURN,
   CHY ORTHO PECKHAM WALK IN. 
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The GUI Client has been updated to correctly search and display Clinic
   names.
  
 35. I11611508FY17- When using the VS GUI, the user currently has no indication
                    whether he is connected to a test or production
                    environment.  An indication must be provided the user when
                    connected to a test environment.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When running VS GUI, there is no indication if the application is live or
   still in a test environment. The system must let the user know they are
   connected to the test environment.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The GUI Client has been updated to display the text 'TEST PRODUCTION' or
   'PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT' in the header based on the Sign-on flag [7].
   'PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT' displays in RED and 'TEST PRODUCTION' displays in
   black on a white background.
  
 36. I12577233FY17- There are differences between VistA and VS GUI regarding
                    NOTES and Comments that do not match.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   The OTHER field (#3) that is in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) under the
   APPOINTMENT multiple field (#1900) and then under the PATIENT multiple field
   (#2) is not populated from the SDEC APPADD rpc if the text has exceeded the
   150 character limit.
   From VistA appointment management (SDAM), when an appointment is added or
   cancelled and if the user enters text in the OTHER INFO prompt, the NOTE
   field (#1) in the SDEC APPOINTMENT file (#409.84) is not being populated.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SDEC APPADD rpc has been updated to limit the note to 150 characters so
   that the 150 character limit is not exceeded.
   The VistA Appointment Management option has been updated to include the
   OTHER INFO comment when calling the update for the SDEC APPOINTMENT file
   (#409.84).
   The post-installation routine SDEC658 will Schedule a one time Taskman job
   that will sync the OTHER field (#3) under the PATIENT multiple field (#2)
   for the APPOINTMENT multiple field (#1900) in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file
   (#44) with the NOTE field (#1) in the SDEC APPOINTMENT file (#409.84).
   A report will be provided via Mailman to the person installing the patch
   once the Taskman job finishes. This report will show the differences between
   the 2 fields and how they were resolved. The subject of the Mailman message
   will be: "SD*5.3*658 NOTE UPDATE REPORT DATA for <date>".
  
 37. I2596663FY17- SDAM Appointment Management errors when a user replies 'YES'
                   to the prompt "WANT PATIENT NOTIFIED OF LAB, X-RAY, OR EKG
                   STOPS?"
  
   Problem:
   -------
   Changes made to accommodate the MULTIPLE APPOINTMENT BOOKING [SDMULTIBOOK]
   option are causing an error at the "WANT PATIENT NOTIFIED OF LAB, X-RAY, OR
   EKG STOPS?" prompt due to the SL variable being killed when the date/time is
   being collected for this prompt.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SDAM Appointment Management has been updated to re-initialize the SL
   variable if needed.
  
  38. I2524606FY17- The DATE APPT MADE and DATA ENTRY CLERK fields of the
                    HOSPITAL LOCATION Appointment record and the PATIENT
                    Appointment record are being over-written when an
                    appointment is Cancelled.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   The DATE APPT MADE field (#8) and the DATA ENTRY CLERK field (#7) in the
   HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) under the APPOINTMENT multiple field (#1900)
   and under the PATIENT multiple field (#2) are being overwritten with the
   current date/time and user if a REMARK is entered.
   Also, the DATE APPT MADE field (#20) and the DATA ENTRY CLERK field (#19) in
   the PATIENT file (#2) under the APPOINTMENT multiple field (#1900) are being
   overwritten with the current date/time and user if a REMARK is entered.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The Set Note logic used by the SDEC APPDEL rpc has been corrected to not
   change the DATA ENTRY CLERK fields and the DATE APPT MADE fields.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 This patch contains no PRE Installation processing.
 Post-Installation processing does the following:
   1. Registers the new APIs to the SDECRPC option.
   2. Builds new cross-references.
   3. Populates the new ABBREVIATION field (#.011) in the SDEC RESOURCE file
      (#409.831).
   4. Adds the new SDEC REQ REOPENED BY SDCANCEL option to the SDOUTPUT menu.
   5. Schedule a one time Taskman job that will sync the OTHER field (#3) under
      the PATIENT multiple field (#2) for the APPOINTMENT multiple field
      (#1900) in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) with the NOTE field (#1) in
      the SDEC APPOINTMENT file (#409.84).
      A report will be provided via Mailman to the person installing the patch
      once the Taskman job finishes. This report will show the differences
      between the 2 fields and how they were resolved. The subject of the
      Mailman message will be: "SD*5.3*658 NOTE UPDATE REPORT DATA for <date>".
