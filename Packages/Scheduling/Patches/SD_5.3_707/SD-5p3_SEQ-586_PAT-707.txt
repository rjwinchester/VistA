 The Community Care Referrals and Authorizations (CCR&A) application is an
 enterprise-wide system used by Community Care (CC) staff to automatically
 generate referrals and authorizations for all Veterans receiving care in
 the community. Clinical and VA CC staff located at VA Medical Centers,
 Outpatient Clinics, Community Based Outpatient Clinics, and Veterans 
 Integrated Service Network offices use this application.  The CCR&A
 solution is an integral component of the VA Community Care Information
 Technology (IT) architecture that allows Veterans to receive care from
 Community Providers.
  
 This patch implements functionality to make, cancel and mark as NO Show 
 appointments for Community Care Referral appointments in non-count clinics
 at the Veteran's home Vista site. The appointment actions are completed in
 the HealthShare Referral Manager (HSRM) software by non-VA and VA care
 coordination staff. Appointment information for appointments made in the
 community is recorded in HSRM, and this data is then automatically pushed
 into Vista using HL7 Scheduling Information Unsolicited (SIU) messages.
  
 NOTE: THIS PATCH IS AN INTERACTIVE PATCH. THE PATCH INSTALLER IS 
 REQUIRED TO ENTER/RESPOND TO PROMPTS DURING THE INSTALLATION.
  
 NOTE: This patch creates the  GMRC HSRM SIU HL7 MESSAGES VistA Mail 
 Group. This mail group will send a VistA email message to the members of 
 this group if there is a problem with filing the HSRM consult 
 appointment due to not being able to match the consult title to a VistA 
 clinic. This group should be populated after the patch install is
 completed. Members of this mail group should be VistA users that can 
 resolve the issue with the clinic name and consult title.
