 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
  
 1.  INC3582232 - <UNDEFINED>DEMW+1^SDACSCG *VA("PID") at NYH
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An undefined error occurs when running the Edit Computer Generated
 Appointment Type [SDACS CGEDIT] option. This error occurs because
 the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER (#409.68) file entry is missing the
 PATIENT (#.02) field.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SDACSCG was modified to ignore records that are missing the
 PATIENT (#.02) field. These are not valid records since the PATIENT
 (#.02) field is required for the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER (#409.68) file.
  
 2.  INC3173455 - Issue with Computer Generated Error Report
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Edit Computer Generated Appointment Type [SDACS CGEDIT] option
 does not contain the necessary patient information for the affected
 end user (AEU) to determine the appointment type for computer generated
 appointments.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SDACSCG was modified to add the information requested by the
 AEU(s) needed to determine the appointment type for computer generated
 appointments. These entry fields include the division, clinic location,
 stop code, service connected, rated disability information, primary
 eligibility, secondary eligibility, and current eligibility for the
 encounter.

 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------------
 Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option.  The message containing the 
 backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at 
 the Message Action prompt.  The PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE is 
 then used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA system.
