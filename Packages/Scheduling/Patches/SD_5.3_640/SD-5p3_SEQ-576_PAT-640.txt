Subject: DISABLE ACRP & APM HL7 TRANSMISSIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch SD*5.3*640 contains the shutdown of the Health Level-7 (HL7)
 Ambulatory Care nightly transmission (ACRP) that goes out from each
 Veteran Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 instance each day to the National Patient Care Database (NPCDB).  The
 NPCDB is being shut down in Austin and the Corporate Data Warehouse
 (CDW) is replacing the database as the authoritative source.  The
 VistA extracts, done to populate the CDW, will replace the need for 
 the HL7 transmission.
  
 Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) has also requested to stop
 the transmission of the Monthly Additional Performance Monitors HL7 data
 from VistA instances to Data Management Interface (DMI) at AITC.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. INC1039897 - DISABLE ACRP HL7 TRANSMISSION
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) requests the shutdown of
    the HL7 Ambulatory Care Reporting Project (ACRP) nightly transmissions
    from each Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC) to the 
    National Patient Care Database (NPCDB).  The NPCDB is being shut
    down in Austin and the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) is replacing
    the database as the authoritative source.
  
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A post-installation routine SCDXSTOP has been created that will:
  
    1. Disable current AMB-CARE logical link to HL7 for ACRP.
  
    2. Ensure that the Ambulatory Care Nightly Transmission to NPCDB [SCDX
       AMBCAR NIGHTLY XMIT] option is not scheduled to run daily.
  
    3. Set the following menu options to out-of-order:
  
       3.1 Ambulatory Care Nightly Transmission to NPCDB
           [SCDX AMBCAR NIGHTLY XMIT]
       3.2 Retransmit Ambulatory Care Data by Date Range
           [SCDX AMBCAR RETRANS BY DATE]
       3.3 Retransmit Selected Error Code 
           [SCDX AMBCAR RETRANS ERROR]
       3.4 Selective Retransmission of NPCDB Rejections 
           [SCDX AMBCAR RETRANS SEL REJ]
  
    A QUIT command will also be added to routines SCDXMSG, SCDXRT01, 
    SCDXRT02, and SCDXRT03 to prevent the option from being executed
    unintentionally.
    
 2. INC1392254 - Discontinue Monthly Additional Performance Monitors HL7 
                 data transmissions from 130 VistA instances to DMI at
                 AITC
  
    Problem:
    --------
    AITC requests the shutdown of the Monthly Additional Performance 
    Monitors HL7 data transmissions from VistA instances to DMI at AITC.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A post-installation routine SCDXSTOP has been created that will:
    
    1. Disable current SDPM logical link to HL7.
  
    2. Ensure that the Nightly job for PM data extract [SDOQM PM NIGHTLY 
       JOB] option is not scheduled to run daily.
  
    3. Ensure the Schedule APM Performance Monitor Task [SCRPW APM TASK
       JOB] option is not scheduled to run on a monthly basis.
       
    4. Set the following menu options to out-of-order:
  
       4.1 Schedule APM Performance Monitor Task
           [SCRPW APM TASK JOB]
  
       4.2 Performance Monitor Retransmit Report (AAC)
           [SCRPW PM RETRANSMIT REPORT]
  
       4.3 Nightly job for PM data extract
           [SDOQM PM NIGHTLY JOB]
  
    A QUIT command will also be added to routines SDPMHLS and SDOQMP
    to prevent the option from being executed unintentionally.
