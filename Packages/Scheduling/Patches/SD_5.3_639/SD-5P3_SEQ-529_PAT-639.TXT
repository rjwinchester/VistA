 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 INC000001282848  Scheduling - Patient Appt Information Transmission:
   
 Problem:
 --------
 Since the VHA Support Service Center (VSSC) no longer uses the patient 
 appointment scheduling data that is generated and transmitted by the 
 Patient Appointment Information Transmission (PAIT) software, VistA sites 
 need to stop the bimonthly appointment data that is wrapped in HL7 batch 
 messages and transmitted to the Austin Information Technology Center 
 (AITC).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The patch will disable the PAIT HL7 transmission from each VistA 
 site to the VSSC at AITC in Austin, Texas. The following will resolve 
 this issue:
  
    1. Disable SD-PAIT Logical Link.
    2. Remove Taskman PAIT Transmission [SD-PAIT TASKED TRANSMISSION]
       task job.
    3. Place the following HL7 SD-PAIT menu options Out-of-Order:
       - SD-PAIT MANUAL BATCH REJECT
       - SD-PAIT MANUAL TRANSMISSION
       - SD-PAIT TASKED TRANSMISSION
       - SD-PAIT REPAIR
    4. Make the following SD-PAIT related HL7 Application Parameters
       inactive.
       - SD-AAC-PAIT
       - SD-SITE-PAIT
  
 Technical:
 ==========
 A post-installation routine SDRPSTOP has been created to insure the 
 SD-PAIT logical link, nightly scheduled background job, PAIT related 
 menu options, and parameters get disabled.
  
 To prevent routines linked to the disabled menu options from running,
 QUIT commands have been added to the entry point of the routines
 SDRPA00, SDRPA04, and SDRPA09.
  
  
 Software and Documentation Distribution:
 ========================================
 Sites may retrieve the documentation directly via SFTP. The preferred 
 method is to SFTP the files from:
  
        download.vista.domain.ext
  
 This transmits the files from the first available SFTP server.  
  
 Sites may also elect to retrieve the documentation directly from the
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory from a specific server as follows:
  
 Albany:          sftp.domain.ext
 Hines:           sftp.domain.ext
 Salt Lake City:  sftp.domain.ext
