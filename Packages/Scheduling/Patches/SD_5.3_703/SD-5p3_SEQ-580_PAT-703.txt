Description:
============

 This patch will include code changes for several routines for three New 
 Service Requests (NSRs) that were approved by the Software Modification
 Waiver Committee associated with Scheduling Package in VistA.
  
 The following will be addressed in this patch:
    1) Remove Full Social Security Number(SSN) from the Appointment List
       [SDLIST] - The national patient Appointment List displays the patient's
       full nine digits of their SSN. Patient Appointment lists are printed 
       in clinics and outpatient areas daily. This modification replaces the 
       entire nine digits of the SSN from the Appointment List with only
       the last four digits of the patient's SSN.
  
    2) Stop Code added to Cancelled Clinic Report - The Cancelled Clinic Report
       [SDAM CANCELLED CLINIC RPT] is used to provide data on clinics that
       have been cancelled. A column was added to the Cancelled Clinic
       Report to provide the Stop Code of the clinic, which identifies the
       specialty or service.
   
    3) SSN REDUCTION - Clinic Availability Report - The Social Security Number
       was being displayed on the Display Clinic Availability Report [SD
       DISPLAY AVAIL REPORT] to protect a patient's full Social Security 
       Number from being viewed a change was made to display the initial of 
       the last name and the last four digits of the Social Security Number.
  
 TECHNICAL SUMMARY:
 ==================   
  
 Routines
 --------
 The routine SDAL0 was modified to replace the entire Social Security
 Number (nine digits) from the Appointment List with only the last four 
 digits of the patient's Social Security Number.
  
 The routine SDAL was modified to update the SSN to be last 4 digits of 
 the SSN on two lines starting in column 41 versus column 44 in the header.
  
 The routine SDAMOCP1 was modified to update the Cancelled Clinic Report. A
 column was added to the Cancelled Clinic Report to provide the Stop Code 
 of the clinic, which identifies the specialty or service.
  
 The routine SDCLAV0 was modified to update the Display Clinic Availability
 Report. The Display was changed to only show the "initial of the last 
 name" and the "last four digits of the Social Security Number.
