 This patch contains server side functionality for the VistA Scheduling
 Enhancements (VSE) Enhancements 3 (E3) project. The VSE E3 project 
 implements a GUI reporting application designed to run on user
 workstations, and launches via a button in the Reports tab in the VSE
 Enhancement 1 (E1) VistA Scheduling GUI application.
  
 This patch contains server functionality to perform the following 
 tasks:
  
 1) Extract appointment and encounter data from VistA Scheduling.
 2) Aggregate extracted data for a specified date range.
 3) Format the aggregated data in a predefined XML schema.
 4) Send the XML data to a requesting application through the RPC Broker.
  
 The report is not available from any legacy VistA option.
  
 The only functionality available within legacy VistA is an option to 
 queue the data extraction and compilation process via VistA option VistA 
 Scheduling GUI Resource Mgmt Report Data Compile [SDEC REPORT DATA]. This
 option has also been added to the Option Scheduling (#19.2) file to run
 once a day at 3 A.M. as a regularly scheduled background task. The
 compiled data is stored in the ^XTMP("SDVSE") and ^XTMP("SDCEX") globals
 for a full year's worth of report data when the scheduled option runs the
 first time. Each subsequent run will only collect appointment related 
 metrics data for the past 90 days. 
  
 After the SDEC REPORT DATA background job completes, a MailMan message 
 will be sent to the user that scheduled the option or that installed the 
 patch. This MailMan message can be turned off by changing the ENTRY 
 ACTION for the option through FileMan. By default, the ENTRY ACTION sets 
 the variable SDECMAIL=1. To turn the MailMan message functionality off, 
 either delete the ENTRY ACTION field entirely, or set the SDECMAIL 
 variable to zero.

 This patch adds a New Style cross-reference on the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTERS 
 file (#409.68). The 'D' index is created as a compound index on the DATE 
 field (#.01) and the CHECK OUT PROCESS COMPLETION field (#.07). The 'D'
 index is only used by the VistA Scheduling GUI Resource Management Report
 to identify potential Provider Outpatient Encounters to include in the
 report metrics.
  
 VistA Remote Procedure Call (RPC) SD VSE FILTER RPC is available for the
 VistA Scheduling GUI application to return the list of Report Types
 (Mental Health, Primary Care, Specialty Care), the list of available date
 aggregates (Year, Quarter, Month, Week, Date), and the date range
 corresponding to the selected date aggregate. The values returned by SD
 VSE FILTER RPC are used to populate the corresponding E3 report filters.
  
 VistA Remote Procedure Call (RPC) SD VSE REPORT RPC returns the report 
 data corresponding to the values selected by the initial three filters 
 (Report Type, Date Aggregate, Date Range).

 Patch Installation in TEST ONLY ***DO NOT INSTALL INTO PRODUCTION***:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The Post Install routine will add new Parameters that are associated with 
 pre-determined Stop Codes. These Stop Codes are used to identify clinics 
 to be included in the VistA Scheduling GUI Resource Management Reports for
 clinic metrics. The categories for these stop codes will be related to
 Primary Care, Specialty Care and Mental Health clinics only.
  
 The Post Install routine will queue a background job to re-index the 
 OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file (#409.68) in order to create the new 'D' 
 cross-reference used to identify Provider Encounters used in the VSE GUI 
 Resource Management Reports.
  
 The Post Install routine will also schedule the SDEC REPORT DATA option 
 to run at 3:00 AM every morning. The last thing the Post Install routine
 will do is trigger the background process to collect the VistA Scheduling
 appointment data to be used by the VistA Scheduling GUI Resource
 Management Reporting tool.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the test system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 minutes
 to install.
