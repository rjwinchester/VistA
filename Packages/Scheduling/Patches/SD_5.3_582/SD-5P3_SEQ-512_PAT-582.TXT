 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC000000467530 - Able to enter inactive clinics in Recall Reminder
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Users are able to do add/edits in Recall Reminders and select clinics
    that are inactive or are scheduled to be inactive at the time of the
    selected recall date.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Branching logic has been added to Input Template [SDRR RECALL CARD ADD]
    that will call a new API added to routine SDRRUTL to determine if the
    selected clinic will be allowed.  The new API (SCREEN1) will check to
    see if the selected clinic is inactive, and if so, will display a
    warning message to the user indicating when the clinic was Inactivated
    and return the user to the Recall Date prompt.
    
    If the clinic contains a scheduled (future) inactivation date, this
    will be compared to the selected Recall Date.  If the selected Recall
    Date is prior to the scheduled inactivation date, selection of that
    clinic will be allowed; otherwise, it will not be allowed, a warning
    message will be displayed and the user taken back to the Recall Date
    prompt.
  
    If the clinic is currently inactive, but contains a scheduled (future)
    reactivation date, the selected Recall Date will be compared to this
    date and if it is after the reactivation date, selection of that clinic
    will be allowed.  If the selected Recall Date is prior to the
    reactivation date, a warning message will be displayed and the user
    taken back to the Recall Date prompt.
  
 2. INC000000465807 - Problem with Option:  Convert Retired Providers/
                      Clinic Recalls
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using menu option Convert Retired Providers/Clinic Recalls [SDRR
    CONVERT ENTRIES], the user is given the option to change the clinic,
    as well as, the provider.  When electing to do so, the user will first
    enter the old clinic and then the new clinic, followed by a selected
    date range.  The problem is, the software will change all clinics for
    the provider, for the selected date range, even if the recalls are not
    for the identified old clinic.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDRR5 will be modified to check each of the providers recalls
    in the RECALL REMINDERS file (#403.5), for both the selected date range
    and the selected old clinic, and only change those where the clinic
    matches the selected old clinic.
  
 3. INC000000517302 - Issue with Date Second Reminder Sent field
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the option Recall Patient Inquiry [SDRR PATIENT INQUIRY],
    if the patient has more than one active recall reminder and a second
    letter has been printed for one of them, the patient inquiry report
    will print the same date in the Date Second Reminder Sent field for
    all of the patient's recalls that display after the recall that had
    the second letter printed.  A FileMan Inquiry into the actual Recall
    Reminders file reveals that only the one recall has actually had a
    second letter printed.  This is a cosmetic print issue with the
    Recall Patient Inquiry option.  Once the variable for the date second
    reminder sent is set, it is not being killed or reset, so the same
    value is printed for all subsequent recalls in the report.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines SDRRINQ and SDRRINQ1 will be modified to kill the variable
    once it is used so that it will either print a null value for the
    subsequent recall reminders or be properly reset to the correct value,
    when applicable.
