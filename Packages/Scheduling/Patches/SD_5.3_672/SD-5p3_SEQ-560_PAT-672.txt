 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. I10959194FY17 - Clinic Group would not display for second patient without
                    searching for a different clinic group first.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   In the VistA Scheduling Graphical User Interface (VS GUI), after searching
   for a Clinic Group for a patient, then selecting a new patient and searching
   for the same Clinic Group, it did not display until the user searched for a
   different clinic group, and searched again for the 1st clinic group.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The code managing Clinic, Provider and Clinic Group schedules has been
   corrected so that when the control gets focus, any existing text is not
   removed.
   When a Clinic, Provider or Clinic Group has been previously selected the
   user can press the enter key when the control has focus and the schedule for
   the selected item will be open.
  
 2. I11259063FY17 - Unable to disposition Wait List from RM Grid.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   A Wait List Request continues to be displayed in the VS GUI RM Grid even
   though the status in VistA reflects it is closed.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The VS GUI Client has been corrected to correctly use the disposition return
   piece of the SDEC WLGET remote procedure.
  
 3. I12362398FY17 - Scheduling Grid continues to display OVERBOOK capability
                    (TEAL color) when a FULL DAY cancelation has been entered.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   Scheduling Grid in VS GUI continues to display OVERBOOK capability
   (TEAL color) when a FULL DAY cancelation has been entered. A message needs
   to display to the user indicating this is an Overbook.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Added message to user when attempting to book appointment on cancelled
   clinic availability.
  
 4. I12487403FY17 - An Unhandled Exception occurs in VS GUI when attempting to
                    use drag and drop for a consult appointment.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When attempting to use drag and drop for a consult appointment, an unhandled
   exception occurs.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   This error occurred when dropping the appointment on an 'unavailable'
   position. The VS GUI client has been corrected to not allow this to
   happen.
  
 5. I12529073FY17 - In VS GUI, Slots in the Grid and the Available Slot Numbers
   Change Depending on Where I Clicked on the Grid.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   I noticed that the available slots in the grid and the available slot
   numbers changed depending on where I clicked on the grid.
   First I opened ash/dermatology md1:
     Clicked on the date of the appt in the calendar 1/30: 60 min appt
      scheduled shows 10:00 slot (0), 10:30 slot (1)
     Clicked on 1/10 in calendar, then came back to 1/30 by clicking date on
      calendar: Now same 60min appt shows availability at 10:00 (0) and blank
      at 10:30.
     I then clicked on 1/31 grid and availability for the 1/30 appt changed
      back to 10:00 (0) and 10:30 (1)
   In addition, I found that when I clicked on 1/27, 1/28 or 1/29
   (days with no availability) the slots on the weekdays moved around.
   The slot count is showing (1) at 9:15, should be a (0).
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The VS GUI Client has been corrected to keep the slot counts aligned with
   the correct slot (line).
  
 6. I12602010FY17 - Patient with a Date of Death can add a new Appointment
                    Request.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When adding a new appointment request in the VistA Scheduling Graphical User
   Interface (VS GUI), the user should be given a message and the system should
   not allow a new appointment request to be added if the patient has a Date of
   Death defined.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The VS GUI client has been corrected to recognize the Date of Death
   definition when adding a new appointment request.
  
 7. I12748395FY17 - Cancel by clinic in VS GUI allows the CID/Preferred date to
                    be changed.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   User is able to change CID/preferred date on appointment by selecting:
    Cancelled by patient
    Changed the CID/preferred date from e.g. 4/12/17 to 6/16/17
    Select Cancelled by clinic - new CID/preferred is retained
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The VS GUI client has been correct to insure the CID\Preferred Date displays
   correctly and cannot be modified for Cancelled by Clinic and Cancelled by
   Patient.
  
 8. I12871937FY17 - VS GUI Audit Report has conflicting counts when displaying
                    by user vs displaying ALL users.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   Audit Report count is changing when using ALL versus selecting an individual
   scheduler.  The date range used is not changed so the count should be the
   same.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   These counts have been corrected in the SDEC SUMMGET remote procedure.
  
 9. I13212697FY17 - Appointments scheduled in VS GUI with past date do not
   display in CPRS coversheet.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   Appointments that have been scheduled via VS GUI, have reached a PAST status
   and are not in checked out, cancelled, or no-show status do not display in
   CPRS in the Encounter pane or on Cover Sheet.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   After the appointment has been filed, SDAM will make an evaluation to
   determine if the checkin and/or checkout prompt needs to display.
   Even if the user does not checkin or checkout, an entry is added to the
   OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file (#409.68).
   This similar logic has been added to the SDEC APPADD remote procedure so
   that the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file is updated and the encounter will display
   in CPRS.
  
 10. I13233499FY17 - Issue in VS GUI when selecting 'Follow-up Needed' when
                     checking out an appointment.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When user selects Follow-Up Needed in the Check Out dialog, selects a date,
   and then clicks OK.  An APPT Request is not displaying so the user can
   create request for follow up appointment.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The VS GUI client has been corrected by fixing a logic error preventing the
   new request dialog from displaying after a Checkout with Follow-up.
  
 11. R14380532FY17 - SDRR CLINIC LETTER REPORT option will not run properly due
                     to bad data.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   If there is an entry in the RECALL REMINDERS file (#403.5) that is missing a
   patient ID, RECALL DATE, CLINIC ID, or if the Clinic record does not contain
   a name, the SDRR CLINIC LETTER REPORT option will throw an error.
   The specific error reported happened because the RECALL REMINDERS entry did
   not contain a patient ID:
    Walla Walla error trap:$ZE= <SUBSCRIPT>SORT+9^SDRRREP ^DPT("")
    S SSN=$E($P(^DPT(DFN,0),"^",9),6,9) S:SSN="" SSN=0
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The SDRR CLINIC LETTER REPORT option has been updated to catch and skip
   records that contain missing required data.
