Subject: Update to CLINIC EDIT LOG report

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 As part of the Fiscal Year (FY) 15 Decision Support System (DSS) updates,
 the Clinic Edit Log report [SD CLINIC EDIT LOG] will be modified so that
 the output can be displayed in an "^" delimited string, which can then be
 imported into a spreadsheet.
  
 **NOTE: As this patch is related to the DSS FY15 updates, it should be 
 installed at the same time as patch ECX*3*149, which contains the DSS FY15
 updates.  It is suggested that this patch be installed prior to patch 
 ECX*3*149.
  
 The clinic Edit Log Report [SD CLINIC EDIT LOG] appears on the Setup for
 DSS Clinic Information [ECX SETUP CLINIC] menu.  This option allows you to
 identify changes made to entries in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44).  
 This report is sortable by USER NAME or by DATE CHANGED and identifies the
 field changed (each change is reported individually) and includes the old
 and new values as well as who made the change and which entry was
 changed.  This option can be assigned as a standalone option for
 Scheduling users, as needed.
