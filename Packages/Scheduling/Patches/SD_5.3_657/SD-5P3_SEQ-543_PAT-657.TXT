Description:
============

 NOTE:   SD*5.3*657 is being released along with EC*2.0*135 in host file:
         SD53_657_EC20_135.KID.
  
  
 SD*5.3*657 provides Fiscal Year 2017 Mid-Year updates to the CLINIC STOP 
 (#40.7) file as requested by the Office of Finance, Managerial Cost 
 Accounting Office (MCAO).
  
 EC*2.0*135 inactivates any DSS Units in Event Capture set to Send No

 SD*5.3*657.
  
                          *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 **************************************************************************
 *  These patches are being released with a compliance date of April 1,   *
 *  2017 and should be installed as close to Close of Business (COB) on   *
 *  March 31, 2017 as possible, but not after April 1, 2017.  Early       *
 *  installation of this patch could result in transmission of incorrect  *
 *  Stop Codes that will result in errors from Austin.  Coordination with *
 *  the MAS (Medical Administration Service) PAS (Program Application     *
 *  Specialist)/ADPAC (Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator) *
 *  is imperative as SD*5.3*657 will cause changes to the CLINIC STOP     *
 *  (#40.7) file.  Testing can be done in a site's mirror account before  *
 *  installation in production to verify changes.  SD*5.3*657 inactivates,*
 *  modifies, and creates Stop Codes effective April 1, 2017; therefore,  *
 *  installing early may modify certain Stop Codes that may currently be  *
 *  in use at your site.  It is advised that clinics with Stop Codes      *
 *  assigned that will incur restriction date/type changes should be      *
 *  corrected as soon as possible after installation.  Please keep in mind*
 *  that new Stop Code corrections should not be assigned in              *
 *  MAS/Scheduling until April 1, 2017 as the PCE encounters bearing      *
 *  FY17 Mid-Year Stop Codes will not be accepted in Austin until that    *
 *  date.  All other MAS Stop Code corrections should be made as early    *
 *  as possible on April 1, 2017.                                         *

 Instructions for the FY17 Mid-Year Stop Code Patch:
  
 SD*5.3*657 makes additions and changes to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file as 
 of April 1, 2017.  Patch EC*2.0*135 inactivates any DSS Units in Event 
 Capture set to Send No Records to PCE with an associated Stop Code being 
 inactivated by SD*5.3*657.
  
 No clinic can be created using any new Stop Codes contained in the patch
 until after this patch is implemented.  Any clinic using a Stop Code
 inactivated by SD*5.3*657 should be replaced with a new clinic using an
 active Stop Code.  This can be accomplished prior to patch implementation
 if desired.
  
 MCA Site Teams, Scheduling and IRM should coordinate to perform the 
 following sequence:
  
 1. From the menu, Setup for DSS Clinic Information [ECX SETUP CLINIC], run
    the DSS worksheet Option 2:  Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File 
    [ECXSCLOAD].  Then, make any necessary adjustments before approval so 
    all clinics on the worksheet have setups applicable for the month of
    March 2017.
  
 2. IRM installs the patch late on March 31 or early on April 1, 2017.
  
 3. Run the Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report [SD CLN STOP CODE REP]
    to list those clinics that need changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44)
    file for FY17 Mid-Year.
  
    Scheduling staff should make changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) 
    file so that the clinics will have the correct Stop Codes in place 
    for April 1st clinic appointments.  
  
    MCA staff: DO NOT make changes using Option 4:  Enter/Edit Clinic
    Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] for the CLINICS AND STOP CODES (#728.44) file 
    at this time.
  
 4. Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract and ECS Extract
    for March 2017.  Do not edit clinic changes for April Stop Code changes
    with Option 4:  Enter/Edit Clinic Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] option or in
    DSS Unit Setup Screens in Event Capture prior to running the March CLI
    Extract.  It is the edit, not the "approve", that changes the values
    included in the extract.  Perform normal AUDITS for the CLI Extract.
  
 5. After auditing and receiving confirmation of successful deblocking of
    the transmitted March CLI Extract, proceed with FY17 Mid-Year Stop Code
    changes to the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes Worksheet clinics and in any
    DSS Units set to Send No Records to PCE.
  
 6. For FY17 Mid-Year:
  
    a. Queue Option 2:  Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File [ECXSCLOAD] to run
       on April 1, 2017.  This option creates local entries in the CLINICS
       AND STOP CODES (#728.44) file and compares this file to the HOSPITAL
       LOCATION (#44) file to see if there are any differences since the
       last time the file was reviewed.
  
    b. After Option 2 has completed, use the Option 3:  Clinics and DSS
       Stop Codes Print [ECXSCLIST].  This option produces a worksheet of
       (A) All Clinics, (C) Active, (D) Duplicate, (I) Inactive, (U)
       Unreviewed Clinics that are awaiting approval, and (X) Export to
       Text File for Spreadsheet.
  
    c. Run Option 7:  Clinic & Stop Codes Validity Report [ECX STOP CODE
       VALIDITY].  This step will check that all Stop Codes conform.  
       Note:  a 'blank' output indicates there are no problems with Stop
       Code and credit stop validity.
  
    d. Update for FY17 Mid-Year as needed using Option 4:  Enter/Edit 
       Clinic Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] option.
  
    e. Approve changes using Option 5:  Approve Reviewed DSS Clinic 
       Worksheet [ECXSCAPPROV] option.  Finalize all Stop Code changes on
       the worksheet to be ready to run the April DSS CLI Extract.
  
    f. Make needed Stop Code changes in Event Capture to DSS Units set to
       Send No Records to PCE.

 code, inactivating three (3) stop codes, reactivating one (1) stop code,
 and changing the names for two (2) stop codes.
  
 Listed below are the applicable stop code updates:

 NOTE: Since this is a combined patch, for information regarding FY17 
       Mid-Year Inactive Stop Code DSS Unit Review, please see Event 
       Capture patch EC*2.0*135.
  
  
 Software Retrieval:
 ===================
 SD*5.3*657 & EC*2.0*135 are combined in host file SD53_657_EC20_135.KID.
  
 Installation of this host file should be coordinated among the packages
 affected since only one installation is necessary.
  
 Sites may retrieve the KIDS build in one of the following ways:
  
   1. The preferred method is to SFTP the file from 
      download.vista.domain.ext which will transmit the file from the
      first available SFTP server.
  
   2. Sites may also elect to retrieve the patch directly using Secure 
      File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
      from the server as follows:
  
      Albany            domain.ext
      Hines             domain.ext
      Salt Lake City    domain.ext
