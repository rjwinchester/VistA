 file as requested by the Office of Finance, Managerial Cost Accounting 
 Office (MCAO).

                         *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 **************************************************************************
 ** These patches are being released with a compliance date of October 1,**
 ** 2016 and should be installed as close to Close of Business (COB) on  **
 ** September 30, 2016 as possible, but not after October 1, 2016.       **
 ** Early installation of this patch could result in transmission of     **
 ** incorrect Stop Codes that will result in errors from Austin.         **
 ** Coordination with the MAS (Medical Administration Service) PAC       **
 ** (Program Application Specialist)/ADPAC (Automated Data Processing    **
 ** Application Coordinator) is imperative as SD*5.3*649 will cause      **
 ** changes to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file. Testing can be done in a    **
 ** site's mirror account before installation in production to verify    **
 ** changes. SD*5.3*649 inactivates and creates Stop Codes effective     **
 ** October 1, 2016; therefore, installing early may modify certain Stop **
 ** Codes that may currently be in use at your site. It is advised that  **
 ** clinics with Stop Codes assigned that will incur restriction date/   **
 ** type changes should be corrected as soon as possible after installa- **
 ** tion. Please keep in mind that new Stop Code corrections should not  **
 ** be assigned in MAS/Scheduling until Oct 1, 2016 as the PCE encounters**
 ** bearing FY17 Stop Codes will not be accepted in Austin until that    **
 ** date. All other MAS Stop Code corrections should be made as early as **
 ** possible on October 1, 2016.                                         **

 MCA Site Team Instructions for the FY17 Stop Code Patch:
  
 SD*5.3*649 makes additions and changes to the Clinic Stop (#40.7) file as 
 of October 1, 2016.  Patch EC*2.0*133 inactivates any DSS Units in Event 
 Capture set to Send No Records to PCE with an associated Stop Code being 
 inactivated by SD*5.3*649.
  
 Any clinic using a Stop Code inactivated by SD*5.3*649 should be replaced 
 with a new clinic using an active Stop Code.  Any DSS Unit inactivated by 
 the patch should be reviewed and updated with an appropriate Stop Code 
 (see step 6e below).
  
 MCA Site Teams, Scheduling and IRM should coordinate to perform the 
 following sequence:
  
   1. From the menu, Setup for DSS Clinic Information [ECX SETUP CLINIC],
      run the DSS worksheet Option 2: Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File
      [ECXSCLOAD]. Then, make any necessary adjustments before approval so 
      all clinics on the worksheet have setups applicable for the month of
      September 2016.
  
   2. IRM installs the patch late on September 30 or early on October 1,
      2016.
  
   3. Run the Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report [SD CLN STOP CODE
      REP] to list those clinics that need changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION
      (#44) file for FY17.  DO NOT make changes using Option 4: Enter/Edit
      Clinic Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] for the CLINICS AND STOP CODES 
      (#728.44) file at this time. Work with scheduling staff to make
      changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file so that the clinics will
      have the correct stop codes in place for October 1st clinic 
      appointments by creating new clinics.
  
   4. Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract and ECS Extract
      for September 2016.  Do not edit clinic changes for October Stop Code
      changes with Option 4:  Enter/Edit Clinic Parameters [ECXSCEDIT]
      option or in DSS Unit Setup Screens in Event Capture prior to running
      the September CLI Extract.  It is the edit, not the "approve" that
      changes the values included in the extract.  Perform normal AUDITS
      for the CLI Extract.
  
   5. After auditing and receiving confirmation of successful deblocking of
      the transmitted September CLI Extract, proceed with FY17 Stop Code
      changes to the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes Worksheet clinics and in
      any DSS Units set to Send No Records to PCE.
  
   6. For FY17:
  
      a. Run Option 2: Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File [ECXSCLOAD] option.
         This option creates local entries in the CLINICS AND STOP CODES 
         (#728.44) file and compares this file to the HOSPITAL LOCATION
         (#44) file to see if there are any differences since the last time
         the file was reviewed.
  
      b. Use the Option 3: Clinics and DSS Stop Codes Print [ECXSCLIST].
         This option produces a worksheet of (A) All Clinics, (C) Active, 
         (D) Duplicate, (I) Inactive, (U) Unreviewed Clinics that are 
         awaiting approval, and (X) Export to Text File for Spreadsheet.
    
      c. Update for FY17 as needed using Option 4:  Enter/Edit Clinic 
         Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] option.
  
      d. Approve changes using Option 5: Approve Reviewed DSS Clinic 
         Worksheet [ECXSCAPPROV] option.  Finalize all Stop Code changes
         on the worksheet to be ready to run the October DSS CLI Extract.
  
      e. Make needed Stop Code changes in Event Capture to DSS Units set
         to Send No Records to PCE.

 Software Retrieval:
 ===================
 SD*5.3*649 & EC*2.0*133 are combined in host file SD53_649_EC20_133.KID.
  
 Installation of this host file should be coordinated among the packages
 affected since only one installation is necessary.
  
 Sites may retrieve the KIDS build in one of the following ways:
  
   1. The preferred method is to SFTP the file from 
      download.vista.domain.ext which will transmit the file from the
      first available SFTP server.
  
   2. Sites may also elect to retrieve the patch directly using Secure 
      File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
      from the server as follows:
  
      Albany            domain.ext
      Hines             domain.ext
      Salt Lake City    domain.ext
