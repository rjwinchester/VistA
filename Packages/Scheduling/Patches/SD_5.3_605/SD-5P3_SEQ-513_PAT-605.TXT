 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC0000000226808 - 5 Patch PX*1*124 not working as described for one
                       patient.
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Future appointments that have notes made prior to the day of the 
 appointment are displaying duplicate encounters on the PCE Encounter 
 List.  The PCE Encounter List screen will display a duplicate encounter 
 after one of the following two things occur:
  
   1) The appointment is Checked Out on the day of the appointment.
   
   OR
  
   2) No action is taken on the day of the appointment but the Appointment
      Status Update (Background)[SDAM BACKGROUND JOB] menu option is ran
      for the appointment date.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A check was added to the ^SDVSIT routine to look for an existing entry in the
 VISIT file [#9000010] for the exact date/time of the appointment and to use 
 that visit if it exists for the patient instead of creating new one.
 A timeout lock was also added to routine SDVSIT to correct an XINDEX
 error.
  
  
 2. INC0000000762365 - Truncated Display of Consult Service Name  
   
 Problem:
 ========
 The list of consults screen in the Make Consult Appointment 
 [SC MAKE CONSULT APPOINTMENT] option does not allocate enough columns to
 show the entire consult service name in all cases. Sometimes the consult
 service name gets truncated. The SERVICE NAME field (#.01) in the REQUEST
 SERVICES file (#123.5) has a maximum length of 63 characters. The list of
 consults screen only allows a length of 23 characters before it truncates.
 This can lead to an incorrect consult service being selected.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Modified routine ^SDCNSLT to increase the display length of the Consult
 Service Name to 63 (the maximum length of the field). This allows users to
 differentiate between multiple services. Other fields were relocated to a
 second line.
