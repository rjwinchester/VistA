Description:
============

 NOTE:   Patch SD*5.3*677 (MID-FY18 STOP CODE UPDATE) is being released
 along with patch EC*2.0*140 (MID-FY18 INACTIVE STOP CODE DSS UNIT REVIEW) 
 in host file: SD53_677_EC20_140.KID.
  
 Patch SD*5.3*677 provides Fiscal Year 2018 Mid-Year updates to the
 CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file as requested by the Office of Finance,
 Managerial Cost Accounting Office (MCAO). 
  
 Patch EC*2.0*140 inactivates any DSS Units in Event Capture set to 
 Send No Records to PCE with an associated Stop Code being inactivated
 by patch SD*5.3*677. 
  
  
                          *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 **************************************************************************
 *  These patches are being released with a compliance date of April 1,   *
 *  2018 and should be installed as close to Close of Business (COB) on   *
 *  Saturday, March 31, 2018 as possible, but not after Sunday, April 1,  *
 *  2018.  Early installation of this patch could result in transmission  *
 *  of incorrect Stop Codes that will result in errors from Austin.       *
 *  Coordination with the MAS (Medical Administration Service) PAS        *
 *  (Program Application Specialist)/ADPAC (Automated Data Processing     *
 *  Application Coordinator) is imperative as patch SD*5.3*677 will cause *
 *  changes to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) file.  Testing can be done in a    *
 *  site's mirror account before installation in production to verify     *
 *  changes. Patch SD*5.3*677 inactivates and creates Stop Codes          *
 *  effective April 1, 2018; therefore installing early may modify        *
 *  certain Stop Codes that may currently be in use at your site. It is   *
 *  advised that clinics with Stop Codes assigned that will incur         *
 *  restriction date/type changes should be corrected as soon as possible *
 *  after installation.  Please keep in mind that new Stop Codes should   *
 *  not be assigned in MAS/Scheduling until April 1, 2018 as the Patient  *
 *  Care Encounter (PCE) encounters bearing FY18 Mid Year Stop Codes will *
 *  not be accepted in Austin until that date. All other MAS Stop Code    *
 *  changes should be made as early as possible on April 1, 2018.         *

 Instructions for the FY18 Mid-Year Stop Code Patch:
  
 Patch SD*5.3*677 makes additions and changes to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7)
 file as of April 1, 2018.  Patch EC*2.0*140 inactivates any DSS Units
 in Event Capture set to Send No Records to PCE with an associated Stop
 Code being inactivated by patch SD*5.3*677. 
  
 No clinic can be created using any new Stop Codes contained in the patch
 until after this patch is implemented.  Any clinic using a Stop Code
 inactivated by patch SD*5.3*677 should be replaced with a new clinic
 using an active Stop Code. This can be accomplished prior to patch
 implementation if desired.
  
 MCA Site Teams, Scheduling and IRM should coordinate to perform the 
 following sequence:
  
 1. From the menu, Setup for DSS Clinic Information [ECX SETUP CLINIC], run
    the DSS worksheet Option 2:  Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File
    [ECXSCLOAD].  Then, make any necessary adjustments before approval so
    all clinics on the worksheet have setups applicable for the month of
    March 2018.
  
 2. IRM installs the patch late on March 31 or early on April 1, 2018.
  
 3. Run the Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report [SD CLN STOP CODE REP]
    to list those clinics that need changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44)
    file for FY18 Mid Year.
  
    Scheduling staff: Make changes in the HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) 
    file so that the clinics will have the correct Stop Codes in place 
    for April 1st clinic appointments.
  
 4. MCA staff: DO NOT make changes for April clinics using Option 4: 
    Enter/Edit Clinic Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] for the CLINICS AND STOP CODES
    (#728.44) file at this time.  Follow normal procedures to run the DSS 
    CLI Extract for March 2018.  It is the edit, not the "approve", that
    changes the values included in the CLI extract.  Perform normal AUDITS
    for the CLI Extract.
  
 5. Do not edit DSS Unit Setup Screens in Event Capture for April prior to 
    running the March ECS Extract. 
  
 6. After auditing and receiving confirmation of successful deblocking of
    the transmitted March CLI Extract, proceed with FY18 Mid-Year Stop Code
    changes to the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes Worksheet clinics and in any
    DSS Units set to Send No Records to PCE.
  
 7. For FY18 Mid-Year:
  
    a. Queue Option 2:  Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File [ECXSCLOAD] to run
       on April 1, 2018.  This option creates local entries in the CLINICS
       AND STOP CODES (#728.44) file and compares this file to the HOSPITAL
       LOCATION (#44) file to see if there are any differences since the
       last time the file was reviewed.
  
    b. After Option 2 has completed, use the Option 3:  Clinics and DSS
       Stop Codes Print [ECXSCLIST].  This option produces a worksheet of
       (A) All Clinics, (C) All Active Clinics, (D) Duplicate Clinics,
       (I) All Inactive Clinics, (U) Unreviewed Clinics that are
       awaiting approval and (X) Export to Text File for Spreadsheet Use.
  
    c. Run Option 7:  Clinic & Stop Codes Validity Report [ECX STOP CODE
       VALIDITY].  This step will check that all Stop Codes conform.  
       Note:  a 'blank' output indicates there are no problems with Stop
       Code and credit stop validity.
  
    d. Update for FY18 Mid-Year as needed using Option 4:  Enter/Edit 
       Clinic Parameters [ECXSCEDIT] option.
  
    e. Approve changes using Option 5:  Approve Reviewed DSS Clinic
       Worksheet [ECXSCAPPROV] option.  Finalize all Stop Code changes on
       the worksheet to be ready to run the April DSS CLI Extract.
  
    f. Make needed Stop Code changes in Event Capture to DSS Units set to 
       Send No Records to PCE.
  
    g. MCA teams with questions, please log a WonderDesk ticket through
       http://vaww.dss.domain.ext/helpdsktckt.asp or by sending an
       Outlook message to the VHA MCAO CSHD mail group.
