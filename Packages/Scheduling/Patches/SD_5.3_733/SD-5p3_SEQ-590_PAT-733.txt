Associated patches: (v)SD*5.3*704  <<= must be installed BEFORE `SD*5.3*733'

Subject: TMP FIXES FOR TELE HEALTH

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses three issues introduced by installing patch 
 SD*5.3*704:
  
  1. # 1120361 - After installing the patch, undefined errors for routine 
  SDTMPHLA were found in the VistA error trap at several sites. The
  "<UNDEFINED>EN+39^SDTMPHLA" error was caused because the status of the
  new appointment was not being checked for the correct status condition.
  As a result, variables were not set correctly and caused the process to
  abort. This patch corrects the check of the appointment status.
  
  2. # 1120407: - After installing the patch, errors were found at several 
  VistA sites in routine SDTMPHLB. These errors were
  "<COMMAND>EN+11^SDTMPHLB *Function must return a value at
  CHKCLIN+1^SDTMPH" this error is caused when a clinic setup 
  has a primary stop code but the secondary stop code field is not
  populated. The function that checks the stop codes has been corrected to
  return a value when either of the stop codes are defined or is null.
  
  3. # 1120947: - This patch also modifies the new cross reference on the 
  Hospital Location File (#44) to only fire when the editing of a clinic
  completes. As originally installed, the cross reference fired after each
  field was entered. This field level trigger caused other required
  variables to not be defined as the message was created and caused the  
  edit of the clinic to abort.

  Software is being released as a PackMan build.
   
  Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
  --------------------------
  In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
  decision to back-out the patch.
    
  It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines 
  included in this patch prior to installation.
   
  The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.  No
  data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no rollback
  strategy is required.
   
  To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
  matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
   
  Patch Installation:
  -------------------
  This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
  recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
  potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
  minutes to install.
