Description:
============

 This patch includes several enhancements to the Clinical Case Registries 
  (CCR) package.  These changes include:
   
  1.   Two new local registries (VA TOTAL KNEE and VA TOTAL HIP) were 
       added including the following functionality:
         a. The set up and initial build of the new registries.
         b. Adding the new registries to the nightly job that searches for
            and adds patients to them, based on registry-specific
            International Classification of Disease, 9th edition (ICD-9), 
            International Classification of Disease, 10th edition
            (ICD-10) procedure codes and Current Procedural Technology 
            (CPT) procedure codes.
         c. The standard local reports currently available in CCR will be
            available for the new registries.
   
  2.   Addition of a new Diagnosis Group for Liver Transplantation 
       within the Common Templates to be used in the report parameters
       screens to limit the report to a specific set of ICD-9 and ICD-10
       diagnoses as defined for Liver Transplantation.
   
  3.   Updates the existing report 'save as' functionality so when a
       user saves a report as a csv file, the information for all veterans
       appears in one worksheet. 
   
  4.  Updates the existing Potential Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) 
      Candidate report by adding a new filter parameter in the reporting 
      functionality for the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score and liver score date
      range.
  
  5.  Addition of a new selection panel on each report except the 
      Sustained Viral Response (SVR) report, the DAA DAA Lab Monitoring
      report and the Potential DAA Candidate report to allow the user to
      limit the report to Veterans based on the two categories of 'No SVR'
      and 'SVR'.
  
  6. A situation reported in Remedy ticket INC000001240065 that involved
     the registry initialization job starting to run within a time  
     period when it was supposed to be suspended has been fixed.
  
  7. Second developer review found non-standard M code that was changed
     to meet the SACC standards.
  
  8. The version of the CCR software was updated to 1.5.26.

  INC000001240065 :  UNY - Clinical Case Registries - Registry  Setup:
                     During installation, if the user elects to queue
                     the [ROR INITIALIZE] Initialize new registries 
                     (one time) option for a time that falls between
                     the suspend start time and the suspend end time,
                     the populate new registries process starts prematurely
                     and causes a slow down in system response time.  This
                     issue was fixed so that if this situation occurs, 
                     the job will start at the selected 'queued to run'
                     time and then will immediately go into a suspended
                     state until the suspend end time has been reached.

  2.  Update GUI.
    
    
  Patch Installation:
  ------------------
   
  M INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ----------------------------
  Installation of the patch will not take more than 5 minutes. This patch
  can be installed with VistA users online, but Registry users should be
  logged out of the CCR Registry Application, as a new GUI is to be
  installed. There are no options that need to be disabled prior to patch
  install.
   
  NOTE: The nightly task (Registry Update & Data Extraction [ROR TASK] 
  option) must not be running during the installation.
   
  Pre/Post Installation Overview:
  -------------------------------
  The pre-installation routine for this patch checks to be sure the task 
  Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE] is not running.  
  If it is, the user is informed of the task number found and that the job
  must finish or be terminated before the patch can be installed.  The 
  patch installation then exits, incomplete.  Routine name is PRE^RORP026.
   
  The post-installation routine for this patch is POST^RORP026 and 
  performs the following functions:
   
    - Adds the Liver Transplantation diagnosis group to common templates
      in the PARAMETERS file (#8989.5)
    - Adds new panels for 'FIB-4' and 'SVR' selection criteria to the
      appropriate reports in the ROR REPORT PARAMETERS file (#799.34)  
    - Adds inpatient procedures fields to the ROR METADATA file (#799.2)
    - Adds new registries to the ROR ICD SEARCH file (#798.5) along with 
      their corresponding procedure codes (ICD-9, ICD-10 and CPT)
    - Adds new entries to the LIST ITEM file (#799.1) for the 2 new
      registries for the appropriate codes sets.
    - Schedules the Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE]
      option to run. 
   
   
  Installation Instructions:
  --------------------------
  The post-initialization routine for this patch schedules the Initialize 
  new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE] task to run.  During the 
  installation process, you will be presented with a series of questions
  that must be answered that will be used to schedule this task.
   
  The following questions provide the parameters needed to schedule
  this task:
   
  Maximum number of registry update subtasks:
    [valid response is a number 0-10]
   
  Suspend the post-install during the peak hours:
    [valid response is Yes/No]
     If the answer to this question is Yes, then the following 2 questions 
     must be answered:
   
        Suspension start time:
          [valid response is any valid time input]
   
        Suspension end time:
          [valid response is any valid time input occurring after the 
           start time]
   
   Date/Time to run the new registry initialize task:
    [valid response is a date/time that is at least 15 minutes in the 
     future.]
    
   
  Installation steps:
  ------------------
   
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
   
  2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
      following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the 
      patch designation 'ROR*1.5*26':
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.  It is
          recommended this step be done as it will be needed if a rollback
          is required for this patch in the future.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
       
  4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
      choose the patch to install.
   
  5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      NO//', respond NO
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? NO//', respond NO

            new registries added with this patch.
  
        b.  Updates data in the following files:
               ROR METADATA (#799.2)
               PARAMETERS (#8989.5)
               ROR REPORT PARAMETERS (#799.34)
               ROR LIST ITEMS (#799.1)
               ROR ICD SEARCH (#798.5)
  
    - Adds the Liver Transplantation diagnosis group to common templates
      in the PARAMETERS file (#8989.5)
    - Adds new panels for 'FIB-4' and 'SVR' selection criteria to the
      appropriate reports in the ROR REPORT PARAMETERS file (#799.34)
