Description:
============

 This patch includes several enhancements and corrections to the Clinical
 Case Registries (CCR) package.  These changes include:
   
 1. Two new local registries added: (Movement Disorders - VA MOVEMENT
    DISORDERS Adrenal Adenoma - VA ADRENAL ADENOMA)  including the
    following functionality:
  
    a. The set up and initial build of the new registries.
    b. Adding the new registries to the nightly job that searches for and
       adds patients to them, based on registry-specific International
       Classification of Disease, 9th edition (ICD-9), International
       Classification of Disease, 10th edition (ICD-10) procedure codes
       and Current Procedural Technology (CPT) procedure codes.
    c. The standard local reports currently available in CCR will be
       available for the new registries.
  
 2. A correction was made for a defect found where the patients ICN was
    missing on the portion of the Pharmacy Prescription Utilization Report
    that lists the Highest Combined Outpatient (OP) and Inpatient (IP)
    Utilization Summary. The report has been updated to include the ICN.
  
 3. A correction was made on the Diagnoses report to keep the
    display of Date of Death (DOD) consistent with all other reports.
    Currently, If a time piece exists in VistA for the DOD, the Diagnosis
    report displays the DOD as the date with the time include.   All the
    other reports display the  DOD as just the date without the time. The
    time stamp has been removed from the Date of Death column on the
    Diagnosis Report to ensure consistency among all reports.
  
 4. Two new report columns, entitled "PACT Team" and "PCP," will be added
    to the report output following the column titled "ICN."
    The "PACT team" data will list the patients Patient Care Team and
    "PCP" data will list the patients Primary Care Provider. These new
    report columns will be added everywhere "ICN" currently appears in all
    reports.  The report column width for these new columns will be sized
    to accommodate approximately 30 characters. 
    If a patient does not have a PACT or PCP, the output will be null.
  
 5. A new selection criteria parameter has been added for 'Age 
    Range'. The new selection criteria is added to all reports on the GUI
    side and to the column header when executing the following reports.
    - BMI by Range
    - Clinic Follow Up
    - Combined Meds and Labs
    - Current Inpatient List
    - DAA Lab Monitoring
    - Diagnoses
    - Hepatitis A Vaccine or Immunity
    - Hepatitis B Vaccine or Immunity
    - Inpatient Utilization
    - Lab Utilization
    - List of Registry Patients
    - Liver Score by Range
    - Outpatient Utilization
    - Pharmacy Prescription Utilization
    - Potential DAA Candidates
    - Procedures
    - Radiology Utilization
    - Registry Lab Tests by Range
    - Registry Medications
    - Renal Function by Range
    - Sustained Virologic Response
    - VERA Reimbursement Report 
  
 6. This patch renamed the existing 'HIV WB' lab test group to 'HIV
    Confirm'. The renamed lab group is located under the Edit Site
    Parameters, Lab Tests tab of the HIV registry and is used to
    include patient confirmatory testing.
    The new 'HIV Confirm' lab group is displayed in the Result Ranges
    panel on the Registry Lab Tests by Range report as well as on the
    Patient Data Editor for those patients where the selected lab test was
    used.
  
 7. One new medication has been added to the ROR GENERIC DRUG file
    (#799.51) to be used as inclusion criteria for patients in the
    respective registry(s).
      a. HEP C registry: SOFOSBUVIR/VELPATASVIR/VOXILAP
  
 8. The version of the CCR software has been updated to 1.5.31.

  M INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ----------------------------
  Installation of the patch will not take more than 5 minutes. This patch
  can be installed with VistA users online, but Registry users should be
  logged out of the CCR Registry Application, as a new GUI is to be
  installed. There are no options that need to be disabled prior to patch
  install.
   
  NOTE: The nightly task (Registry Update & Data Extraction [ROR TASK] 
  option) must not be running during the installation.
   
  Pre/Post Installation Overview:
  -------------------------------
  The pre-installation routine for this patch checks to be sure the task 
  Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE] is not running.  
  If it is, the user is informed of the task number found and that the job
  must finish or be terminated before the patch can be installed.  The 
  patch installation then exits, incomplete.  Routine name is PRE^RORP031.
   
  The post-installation routine for this patch is POST^RORP031 and 
  performs the following functions:
   
  
     - Adds a new selection panel, AGE_RANGE to all CCR to report.
  
     - Adds the new AGE_RANGE entry to the ROR XML ITEM file (#799.31).
  
     - Rename HIV WB entry in the ROR LIST ITEM file (#799.1) to "HIV 
       Confirm"

 M Installation Instructions:
 ----------------------------
  1. Unschedule or delete the Registry Update & Data Extraction [ROR
     TASK] job (CCR nightly job).
  
  2. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
   
  3.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
  4.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
      following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the 
      patch designation 'ROR*1.5*31':
  
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.    It is
          recommended this step be done as it will be needed if a rollback
          is required for this patch in the future.
      b.  **Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
            ** Note that for this patch, this option will produce a system
               error due to the known problem with Fileman not correctly
               handling the lookup to a file with no B cross reference.
               There is currently no workaround for this problem.
               The error expected to be produced is:
                 I C["P",$D(@("^"_$P(^(0),U,3)_"0)")) S C=$P(^(0),U,2)
                 Q:'$D(^(+Y,0))  S Y=$P(^(0),U) I $D(^DD(+C,.01,0)) S
                 C=$P(^(0),U,2) G S
                 <SYNTAX>S+1^DIQ
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
      d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
  5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
     ROR*1.5*31.
