Subject: CCR ENHANCED REPORTS, HEP A/HEP B

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch includes several enhancements to the Clinical Case Registries 
 (CCR) package.  These changes include:
   
    1. A new Selection Panel was added on each report except Diagnosis
       report for a diagnosis date range.  This will allow the user to 
       limit the report to patients with one or more select diagnosis of
       interest within the specified date range.
   
    2. Two new clinical reports were added to the CCR available reports
       list.
      
         a. Hepatitis A Immunity or Vaccine
         b. Hepatitis B Immunity or Vaccine
  
       These 2 reports allow users of the CCR system to get a list of
       patients who were treated at the V.A. and who have or do not have
       vaccination and/or immunity for the associated Hepatitis disease for
       investigative purposes.  Additional fields can be used to further
       screen the patients who will be included on this report.
  
    3. The version of the CCR software was updated to 1.5.29. 
   
  
 This patch adds the following new GUI elements:
  
  1. A new selection panel created, entitled, "Patients" to use with the new 
      Hep A and Hep B reports. 
  
  2. A new selection panel created, entitled, "Vaccinations Date Range" to 
      use with Hep A and Hep B reports.
  
  3. A new selection panel created, entitled, "Immunity Date Range" to use
      with Hep A and Hep B reports.
  
  4. The version of the CCR GUI software has also been updated to 1.5.29.
