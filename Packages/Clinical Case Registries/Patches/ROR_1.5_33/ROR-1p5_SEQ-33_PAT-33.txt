 *** BEFORE PATCH INSTALLATION PLEASE READ SECTION 5 OF THE INSTALLATION GUIDE
  
 1.     Six new local registries added: 
       (Transplant Heart - VA TRANSPLANT HEART
        Transplant Intestine - VA TRANSPLANT INTESTINE
        Transplant Kidney - VA TRANSPLANT KIDNEY
        Transplant Liver - VA TRANSPLANT LIVER
        Transplant Lung - VA TRANSPLANT LUNG
        Transplant Pancreas - VA TRANSPLANT PANCREAS)
      
        including the following functionality:
  
     a. The set up and initial build of the new registries.
     b. Adding the new registries to the nightly job that searches for and
        adds patients to them, based on registry-specific International
        Classification of Disease, 9th edition (ICD-9), International
        Classification of Disease, 10th edition (ICD-10) procedure codes.
     c. The standard local reports currently available in CCR will be
        available for the new registries.
  
  
  2. Three new medications are added to the ROR GENERIC DRUG file
     (#799.51) to be used as inclusion criteria for patients in the
     respective registry(s).
          a. HIV registry   BICTEGRAVIR/EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR
                            EFAVIRENZ/LAMIVUDINE/TENOFOVIR
                            LAMIVUDINE/ TDF
   
  3. A new Future Appointments selection panel is added to the 
   following seven reports for all registries:
  
   1) BMI by Range
   2) Combined Meds and Labs
   3) Hepatitis A Vaccine or Immunity
   4) Hepatitis B Vaccine of Immunity
   5) Liver Score by Range
   6) Registry Lab Tests by Range
   7) Renal Function by Range 
  
   For the Hepatitis C registry only:
   1) Potential DAA Candidates
   
  4. The new future appointment panel will have a radio button
    with a label "All Patients" which will be the default. A second
    button with a label "Only patients with an appointment in the
    next X days". If the user selects this button,
    then the box is active and the user must type in a number that
    will find future appointments that are scheduled from the run date
    to X days in the future  A column will then be displayed on the
    report that shows the date of that next appointment. Only those
    patients that have future appointments in that time frame will be
    displayed on the report. 
   
    If the "All Patients" default is chosen, all patients that fall into the
   report range will be displayed and
   no future appointment information will be displayed.
   
   
  5. On the report header for reports that display "Only patients with
   appointment in the X number of days", new text will be displayed as follows
   to let the user know that the report was run for future appointments only.
   
               Options:           Only appts in the next X days
   
   
  6. New LOINC codes have been added to the ROR LAB SEARCH file (#798.9) 
   to add patients to the HIV pending list.   They are:

      reports when sorting by the ICN, PACT or PCP columns. 
       
  8. New functionality for un-scheduling the ROR TASK nightly job
 when new registries are being added to the Clinical Case Registry (CCR) 
 package. (Section 5 of Installation Guide).  If the ROR TASK Job is
 not running, the task will be unscheduled by the install process
 and will remain unscheduled until all registries have
 been initiated. When the registries finish populating,
 one of three mailman messages will be generated: 
  
 If the ROR TASK job does not exist: 
 SUBJECT: ROR TASK option must be scheduled
          Please use the Schedule/Un-schedule Options [XUTM SCHEDULE]
          option to schedule the ROR TASK option to run as a regular
          background job.
                   
          Set the time of day to whatever you think best.
          Set the Rescheduling Frequency = 1D
          Set the Task Parameters = VA HEPC, VA HIV
  
 If the ROR TASK job was rescheduled:
 SUBJECT: ROR TASK option was rescheduled
          The ROR TASK option was successfully rescheduled.
          
          You may wish to check/alter the scheduling conditions, but
          please keep this option scheduled at all times unless a ROR
          patch is being installed.
          
          Use Schedule/Un-schedule Options [XUTM SCHEDULE] to check.
  
 If the ROR TASK job was not rescheduled:
 SUBJECT: ROR TASK option was not rescheduled
          The ROR TASK option could not be rescheduled.
          Please reschedule it as soon as possible.
          ROR TASK should be scheduled to run daily unless a ROR
          patch is being installed.
          
          Use the Schedule/Un-schedule Options [XUTM SCHEDULE] option
          to schedule ROR TASK.

 ------------------
  
 M Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
  
  
  
  
  
 M INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ----------------------------
 Installation of the patch will not take more than 5 minutes. This patch
 can be installed with VistA users online, but Registry users should be
 logged out of the CCR Registry Application, as a new GUI is to be
 installed. There are no options that need to be disabled prior to patch
 install.
   
 NOTE: The nightly task (Registry Update & Data Extraction [ROR TASK] 
 option) must not be running during the installation.
   
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 The pre-installation routine for this patch checks to be sure the task 
 Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE] is not running.  
 If it is, the user is informed of the task number found and that the job
 must finish or be terminated before the patch can be installed. 
  
 The pre-installation routine also checks to see if the Registry Update and
 Data Extraction [ROR TASK] background job is running. If it is, the user is 
 informed and the patch cannot be installed until that job is finished.
  
 The post-installation routine for this patch is POST^RORP033 and 
 performs the following functions:
   
 a)     Identifies new LOINC codes to track,
 b)     Identifies new drugs to track, and
 c)     Adds future appointment to reports
 d)     Reschedules the ROR TASK option and sends a MailMan message to
        the patch installer.
