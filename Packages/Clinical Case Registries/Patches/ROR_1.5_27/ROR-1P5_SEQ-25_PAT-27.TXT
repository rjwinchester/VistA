  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  This patch includes several modifications to the Clinical Case Registries
  (CCR) package:
  
     1.  Add 3 new medication entries to the ROR GENERIC DRUG file 
         (#799.51)
          a.  Abacavir/Dolutegravir/Lamivudine
                Abbreviation: ABC/DOL/3TC
          b.  Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir
                Abbreviation: LED/SOF
          c.  Dasabuvir/Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/Ritonavir
                Abbreviation: OBV/PTV/r+DSV
  
     2.  Modifications to Potential Direct Acting Antiviral  (DAA)
         Candidate report to remove exclusion of patients who received
         Boceprevir or Telaprevir.
  
     3.  Modifications to Potential DAA Candidate report to remove
         exclusion of patients who do not have genotype 1.
  
     4.  Correct the definition of Sustained virologic response (SVR) by
         removing the criteria that patients whose lab results starts with
         ">" have SVR.
  
     5.  Correct the List of Patients Report selection screen by disabling
         the Registry Status Pending Comment check box if Pending is not
         checked. (GUI) 
  
     6.  Update Help Files Copied to Local Drive for Network Installations
         (GUI)
  
     7.  Modify Custom Controls within the CCR GUI to Ensure Section 508
         Compliance (GUI)
  
     8.  Modified the global lock logic in routine RORLOCK to utilize the
         minimum default lock time system variable DILOCKTM rather than
         3 seconds.  This is a correction for a SACC violation reported in
         closed Remedy ticket #968114 (DILOCKTM not being utilized)
  
     9.  Added entries to the ROR LIST ITEM file to make sure the 
         proper Result Ranges panels appear on the BMI by Range, Liver
         Score by Range and Renal Function by Range reports for each of 
         the following 9 registries: 
             VA ALS, VA APNEA, VA COLORECTAL CANCER, VA HCC, VA LUNG 
             CANCER, VA MELANOMA, VA OSTEOPOROSIS, VA PANCREATIC CANCER,
             VA PROSTATE CANCER
  
    10.  The version of the CCR software is updated to 1.5.27.
  
    11.  Remedy tickets 1228316 and 1227499 reported a problem involving
         a maxstring error that was occurring in the nightly job.  This 
         has been resolved. Some sites that encountered the maxstring
         error were instructed to inactivate some of the registries added
         with patch ROR*1.5*24 to temporarily avoid the error.  The post
         installation in this patch will reactivate any of the 8 registries
         included in patch ROR*1.5*24 that have been marked as inactive.

  Patch Installation Overview:
  ============================ 
   
  This patch includes an M patch and a revised Graphical User Interface
  (GUI) executable.
   
  Below is a summary of the installation steps required for this patch.
   
  1.  Install M components.
  2.  Update GUI.
    
    
  Patch Installation:
  ------------------
   
  M INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ----------------------------
  Installation of the patch will not take more than 5 minutes. This patch
  can be installed with VistA users online, but Registry users should be
  logged out of the CCR Registry Application, as a new GUI is to be
  installed. There are no options that need to be disabled prior to patch
  install.
   
  NOTE: Make sure the nightly task (Registry Update & Data Extraction [ROR
        TASK] option) is not running during the installation.
   
  Pre/Post Installation Overview:
  -------------------------------
  The pre-installation routine for this patch checks to be sure the user
  installing the patch holds the ROR VA IRM security key. If this is not
  the case, the user is prompted that the install has aborted and must be
  restarted by someone who owns this key.  Routine name is PRE^RORP027.
   
  The post-installation routine is POST^RORP027 and performs the following
  2 steps:
     1.  Checks the STATUS of the 8 registries in the ROR REGISTRY
         PARAMETERS file (#798.1) that were added by patch ROR*1.5*24.  If
         any of these entries are marked as INACTIVE, they will be
         reactivated.  In the unlikely event that the registry status
         cannot be changed, the user will be warned that they should update
         the status for the registry manually using Fileman.
  
     2.  Adds new entries to the ROR LIST ITEM file (#799.1) for each new
         registry added in patches ROR*1.5*21 and ROR*1.5*24 to make sure
         the proper Result Ranges panels appear on the BMI by Range, Liver
         Score by Range and Renal Function by Range reports.

          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
