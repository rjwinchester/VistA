Description:
============

 This patch includes several enhancements to the Clinical Case Registries
 (CCR) package.  These changes include:
  
    1.  The entire Clinical Care Registries graphical user interface (CCR
        GUI) has been reviewed for adherence to the Section
        508 standards. Modifications will be made to the custom controls
        within the CCR GUI to obtain complete Section 508 certification.
  
    2. An additional selection panel titled "Sex" will be created.
  
    3. To facilitate off-line record matching, patient Integration 
       control number (ICN) will be added to all reports, except the
       Current Inpatient List.
  
    4. An additional selection panel titled "Additional Identifier" will 
       be created.
    
    5. The "Utilization Date Range" selection panel will be added to the
       Diagnosis Report in order to provide sites with the ability to run 
       reports that limit output to patients with utilization within a
       specific date range.
  
    6. Addition of a new the Obstructive Sleep Apnea Registry (VA APNEA) 
       local registry including:
       a. The initial build of the new registry.
       b. Including the new registry in the nightly job that searches for
          and adds patients to the registry, based on registry-specific
          International Classification of Disease, 9th edition (ICD-9)
          codes.
       c. Most local reports currently available in CCR will be available 
          for the new registry.
  
    7. Report enhancement for screen on gender.
  
    8. Report enhancement for addition of optional additional identifier
       column.  This column will contain the patient's ICN.
  
    9. Addition of a new drug (Dolutegravir) for the Human Immunodeficiency
       Virus (HIV) registry.
  
   10. The nightly Health level 7 (HL7) message will be updated to also
       include the number of reports run in all of the local registries
       including the new Obstructive Sleep Apnea Registry.
