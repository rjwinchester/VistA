Subject: SUSTAINMENT PATCH FOR CLINICAL CASE REGISTRIES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch includes the following corrections to the 
 Clinical Case Registries (CCR) package.
   
  
  
 1.     Three new local registries are added: 
           -  Lymphoma Registry  - VA LYMPHOMA
           -    NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) Registry - VA NASH
           -    ILD (interstitial lung disease) Registry  -  VA ILD
     
      
        including the following functionality:
  
     a. The set up and initial build of the new registries.
     b. Adding the new registries to the nightly job that searches for and
        adds patients to them, based on registry-specific International
        Classification of Disease, 9th edition (ICD-9), International
        Classification of Disease, 10th edition (ICD-10) procedure codes.
     c. The standard local reports currently available in CCR will be
        available for the new registries.
  
  
  2. One new medication is added to the ROR GENERIC DRUG file
     (#799.51) to be used as inclusion criteria for patients in the
     respective registry.
          a. HIV registry   COBICISTAT/DARUNAVIR/EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR AF
            Abbreviated:   "COBI/DARUNAVIR/EMTRIC/TAF"
   
  3. The Future Appointments selection panel is added to the 
     following two reports for all registries:
  
   1) Diagnoses
   2) Procedures
   
   
  4. On reports where the Future Appointments panel is 
     available, a new column Clinic Name has been added to
     all reports to the right of the Next Appt column.
  
  
  5. A new column, Admission Date has been added to the left of 
     Admitting Diagnosis column on the report output for the
     Current Inpatient List report. 
   
  
  6. The display of the LOINC codes on the top of the Hepatitis A
     and Hepatitis B reports were not displaying. This issue has
     been resolved in this patch.  The LOINC codes now display 
     prior to the data.
  
       
  7. Tool tips have been fixed for the Vaccination Date Range and 
    Immunity Date Range panels on the Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B reports. 
  
  
       
  8. The version of the CCR software has been updated to 1.5.34

 Installation of the patch will not take more than 5 minutes. This patch
 can be installed with VistA users online, but Registry users should be

 Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE] is not running.  
 If it is, the user is informed of the task number found and that the job
 must finish or be terminated before the patch can be installed. 
  
 The pre-installation routine also checks to see if the Registry Update and
 Data Extraction [ROR TASK] background job is running. If it is, the user is 
 informed and the patch cannot be installed until that job is finished.
  
 The post-installation routine for this patch is POST^RORP034 and 
 performs the following functions:
   
 a)     Adding CPT and ICD9 and ICD10 codes added to ROR ICD SEARCH file
 b)     Identifies new drugs to track, and
 c)     Adds future appointment to reports
 d)     Reschedules the ROR TASK option and sends a MailMan message to
