Description:
============

 This patch includes several enhancements and corrections to the Clinical
 Case Registries (CCR) package.  These changes include:
  
 1. Two new local registries added: (Transgender - VA TRANSGENDER and
    Frailty - VA FRAILTY) including the following functionality:
  
    a. The set up and initial build of the new registries.
    b. Adding the new registries to the nightly job that searches for and
       adds patients to them, based on registry-specific International
       Classification of Disease, 9th edition (ICD-9), International
       Classification of Disease, 10th edition (ICD-10) procedure codes.
    c. The standard local reports currently available in CCR will be
       available for the new registries.
  
 2. Two new medications have been added to the ROR GENERIC DRUG file
    (#799.51) to be used as inclusion criteria for patients in the
    respective registry(s).
      a. HEP C registry  : GLECAPREVIR/PIBRENTASVIR
      b. HIV registry    : DOLUTEGRAVIR/RILPIVIRINE
  
 3. This patch is adding the "Admitting Diagnosis" (Free-Text) as a new
    column in the 'Current Inpatient List' report. The new column will be
    located after the Room-Bed column.
  
 4. The Hep A and B Immunity reports have been modified to look at the most
    recent immune status result.
  
 5. Updates to Patient Medication history - The patient medication history
    report has been modified to include all medications even if the drugs
    are unmatched to the VA Products.
  
    To resolve this issue the following have been made:
  
    - Post install routine of the patch has been designed to collect 
      existing drug matching on daily basis and store them in ROR files.
    - A new nightly job which will be executed automatically is called 
      Schedule ROR Drug Match [ROR DRUG MATCH]
    - Patient Medication report has been modified to check the new 
      matching nodes created by this patch if they do not exist in pharmacy
      side.
  
 6. In the CCR GUI, the Patient Editor title has been modified to display 
    the correct registry name when a local registry is selected.
  
 7. In the CCR GUI, the BMI by Range and the Renal Function by Range CSV 
    output has been modified to not display "No data has been found" when 
    the Summary only option was selected for the report.
  
 8. In the CCR GUI, a "More" button has been added after the "Patients 
    found" count when there are more patients than the maximum number of
    patients to retrieve setting is set for.
  
 9. The version of the CCR software has been updated to 1.5.32.
