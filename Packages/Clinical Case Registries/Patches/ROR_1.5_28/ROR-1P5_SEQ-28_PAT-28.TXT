Description:
============

 This patch includes several enhancements and corrections to the Clinical
 Case Registries (CCR) package.  These changes include:
   
     1. Five new local registries added: (Crohn's Disease - VA CROHNS,
         Dementia - VA DEMENTIA, Hepatitis B - VA HEPB, Thyroid Cancer - 
         VA THYROID CA and Ulcerative Colitis - VA UC) including the
         following functionality:
           a. The set up and initial build of the new registries.
           b. Adding the new registries to the nightly job that searches
              for and adds patients to them, based on registry-specific
              International Classification of Disease, 9th edition (ICD-9),
              International Classification of Disease, 10th edition
              (ICD-10) procedure codes and Current Procedural Technology 
              (CPT) procedure codes.
           c. The standard local reports currently available in CCR will be
              available for the new registries.
   
     2. It was discovered that the CCR national database is missing some
         problem list entries for the patients in the HIV and Hepatitis-C
         registries dating from 2009 through 2011.  To recover this data,
         this patch will force the CCR nightly job [ROR TASK] to perform a
         one time re-extract of all problem list entries that were added 
         from 1/1/2009 to the present for patients in these two registries.
         This may cause a slight increase in the amount of time it takes
         the nightly job to finish the first time it runs after the
         installation of this patch.
  
     3. A problem was discovered with the header display if a user selects
         the "Complete" or "Summary" report option when running a report.  
         The words 'Complete Report' or 'Summary Report' are supposed to
         display after the label Options:, but currently, nothing is being
         displayed there. 
  
     4. Six new medications have been added to the ROR GENERIC DRUG file
         (#799.51) to be used as inclusion criteria for patients in the
         respective registry(s).
           a. HIV registry: ATAZANAVIR/COBICISTAT, COBICISTAT/DARUNAVIR,
                             ELVITEGRAVIR
           b. HEP C registry: OMBITASVIR/PARATEPREVIR/RITONAVIR,
                              DACLATASVIR, ELBASVIR/GRAZOPREVIR
  
     5. A new selection criteria parameter has been added to the DAA Lab
        Monitoring report.  The parameter is used to screen the drug list
        for whether the drug was DAA supplied or in-house filled.
  
     6. A correction was made for a defect found where the ICN value does
        not appear on the INPATIENT UTILIZATION report when the user
        selects to include additional identifier in the report request.
  
     7. When the VA TOTAL KNEE and VA TOTAL HIP registries were added to 
        the CCR system by a previous patch, the word Registry was not
        added to the display name of the registries.  This was fixed in
        this patch by adding the word 'Registry' to the entry in the 
        SHORT DESCRIPTION (#4) field of the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file
        (#798.1) for the VA TOTAL KNEE and VA TOTAL HIP registry entries. 
  
     8. A modification was made to allow the DAA Lab Monitoring report to 
        use all drugs defined for the registry as well as locally defined
        drugs as screening criteria for the report.
  
     9. Conversion of GUI from Delphi XE5 to Delphi XE8.
  
    10. The version of the CCR software has been updated to 1.5.28.

  Patch Installation Overview:
  ============================ 
   
  This patch includes an M patch and a revised Graphical User Interface
  (GUI) executable.
   
  Below is a summary of the installation steps required for this patch.
   
  1.  Install M components.
  2.  Update GUI.
    
    
  Patch Installation:
  ------------------
   
  M INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ----------------------------
  Installation of the patch will not take more than 5 minutes. This patch
  can be installed with VistA users online, but Registry users should be
  logged out of the CCR Registry Application, as a new GUI is to be
  installed. There are no options that need to be disabled prior to patch
  install.
   
  NOTE: The nightly task (Registry Update & Data Extraction [ROR TASK] 
  option) must not be running during the installation.
   
  Pre/Post Installation Overview:
  -------------------------------
  The pre-installation routine for this patch checks to be sure the task 
  Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE] is not running.  
  If it is, the user is informed of the task number found and that the job
  must finish or be terminated before the patch can be installed.  The 
  patch installation then exits, incomplete.  Routine name is PRE^RORP028.
   
  The post-installation routine for this patch is POST^RORP028 and 
  performs the following functions:
   
     - Modifies two registry entries' SHORT DESCRIPTION field (#4) of the
       ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file (#798.1) to add the word 'Registry'.
       These registries were recently added by patch ROR*1.5*26 and this is
       needed to keep the display of registry names in the CCR GUI
       consistent. The registries affected are VA TOTAL HIP (Total Hip
       Replacement Registry) and VA TOTAL KNEE (Total Knee Replacement
       Registry).
  
     - Adds a new selection panel to the DAA Lab Monitoring report.
  
     - Sets the flag to force the nightly job HL7 extract to back pull the
       problem list entries from 2009 forward for patients in the HIV and
       Hepatitis-C registries.
  
     - Schedules the Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE]
       option to run. If the new registries included in the patch have
       already been initialized, the user can opt not to re-do the 
       initialize for each registry.
  
     - Adds nine entries to the ROR LIST ITEM file (#799.1) for each of the
       new registries added with this patch.
  
   
  Installation Instructions:
  --------------------------
  The post-initialization routine for this patch schedules the Initialize 
  new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE] task to run.  During the 
  installation process, you will be presented with a series of questions
  that must be answered that will be used to schedule this task.
  
  The following questions provide the parameters needed to schedule
  this task:
   
  Maximum number of registry update subtasks:
    [valid response is a number 0-10]
   
  Suspend the post-install during the peak hours:
    [valid response is Yes/No]
     If the answer to this question is Yes, then the following 2 questions 
     must be answered:
   
        Suspension start time:
          [valid response is any valid time input]
   
        Suspension end time:
          [valid response is any valid time input occurring after the 
           start time]
   
   Date/Time to run the new registry initialize task:
    [valid response is a date/time that is at least 15 minutes in the 
     future.]
    
  
 If this patch was previously installed and one or more of the new
  registries has already been initialized, the following will be
  prompted to allow this step to be skipped for each of the new 
  registries:
  
     >> New registry <registry name (internal entry number of registry)>
  has already completed initialization
  Do you want to rerun its initialization?: NO// 
  
 Once initialized, do not respond YES to this prompt unless you are
 requested to do so by the CCR team.
  
  
  Installation steps:
  ------------------
   
  1. Unschedule or delete the Registry Update & Data Extraction [ROR
     TASK] job (CCR nightly job).
  
  2. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
   
  3.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
  4.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
      following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the 
      patch designation 'ROR*1.5*28':
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.    It is
          recommended this step be done as it will be needed if a rollback
          is required for this patch in the future.
      b.  **Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
            ** Note that for this patch, this option will produce a system
               error due to the known problem with Fileman not correctly
               handling the lookup to a file with no B cross reference.
               There is currently no workaround for this problem.
               The error expected to be produced is:
                 I C["P",$D(@("^"_$P(^(0),U,3)_"0)")) S C=$P(^(0),U,2)
                 Q:'$D(^(+Y,0))  S Y=$P(^(0),U) I $D(^DD(+C,.01,0)) S
                 C=$P(^(0),U,2) G S
                 <SYNTAX>S+1^DIQ
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
       
  5.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
      choose the patch to install.
   
  6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      NO//', respond NO
  
  7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? NO//', respond NO
  
  8.  The post-initialization routine for this performs the following 
      functions:
          a. Updates data in the following files:
                 ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS (#798.1)
                 ROR REPORT PARAMETERS (#799.34)
  
          b. Adds nine entries to the ROR LIST ITEM file (#799.1) for each
             of the new registries added with this patch.
  
          c. Adds new panel for 'DAA_DRUGS' selection criteria to the DAA
             Lab Monitoring report in the ROR REPORT PARAMETERS file
             (#799.34)
  
          d. Updates the SHORT DESCRIPTION names of the VA TOTAL HIP and VA
             TOTAL KNEE registries in the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file
             (#798.1)
    
          e. Sets the flag to force the nightly job HL7 extract to back
             pull the problem list entries from 2009 forward for patients
             in the HIV and Hepatitis-C registries.
  
          f. Schedules the Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR 
             INITIALIZE] option to run. This task sets up and populates the
             5 new registries added with this patch.
  
          g. You must periodically (at least once per day) check the status
             of the Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE]
             job.  When it has successfully completed, you must restart the
             Registry Update & Data Extraction [ROR TASK] job.
