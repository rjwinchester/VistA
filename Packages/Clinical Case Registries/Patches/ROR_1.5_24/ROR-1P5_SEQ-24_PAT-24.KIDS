Clinical data may be entered into the VistA system

later than they are available. For example, an
"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,3,0)

Because of this delay, data may be missed by the

registry update and data extraction processes if they
"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,8,0)
look for the data until the current date and then
"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,9,0)

"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,11,0)
To avoid this problem, data search intervals are 
"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,12,0)
overlapped by the number of days indicated by this 
"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,13,0)
field. The registry update process looks for new data 
"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,14,0)
not from the end date of its previous run but from the 
"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,15,0)
date that is earlier by the number of days from this 
"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,16,0)
field. This overlap increases the chances of data
"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,17,0)
entered retrospectively to be found by the next run of
"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,18,0)
the registry update process.
"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,19,0)
 
"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,20,0)
Moreover, the regular data extraction process extracts
"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,21,0)
data not until the date when the process is run but
"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,22,0)
until the date that is earlier by the number of days
"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,23,0)

"^DD",798.1,798.1,15.1,23,24,0)

If you want the changes in the security keys

allocation to have an effect immediately, you
"^DIC",798.1,798.1,"%D",19,0)
should rebuild the "ACL" cross-reference of the
"^DIC",798.1,798.1,"%D",20,0)
.01 field of the SECURITY KEY multiple of this
"^DIC",798.1,798.1,"%D",21,0)
file. See the description of the cross-reference
"^DIC",798.1,798.1,"%D",22,0)

The ROR SELECTION RULES file contains definitions
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",2,0)
of the selection rules that are used to screen
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",3,0)
patients for addition to the registries. There are
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",4,0)
two kinds of rules: top-level and lower level.
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",5,0)
 
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",6,0)
If a rule is referenced by the ROR REGISTRY 
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",7,0)
PARAMETERS file, it is the top-level rule.
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",8,0)
Non-zero value of any top-level rule expression 
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",9,0)
directly determines that the patient should be
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",10,0)
added to the corresponding registry.
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",11,0)
 
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",12,0)
Lower level rules are referenced only by other 
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",13,0)
rules (by rule macros in the expressions). Their
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",14,0)
expressions are evaluated in the proper order, and
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",15,0)
the result values are used in the expressions of 
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",16,0)
other rules. Lower level rules have an indirect
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",17,0)
impact on the final result and can be used for
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",18,0)
complex processing of linked files and multiples.
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",19,0)
 
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",20,0)
For example, a lower level rule can calculate 
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",21,0)
maximum and minimum values of a parameter in the
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",22,0)
sub-file, and a top-level rule will analyze these
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",23,0)
values and decide if the patient should be added 
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",24,0)
to the registry. Moreover, they could be used to
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",25,0)
split a very complex rule into several simpler
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",26,0)
rules.
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",27,0)
 
"^DIC",798.2,798.2,"%D",28,0)
Records of the file are uniquely identified by the

rule name (the "A" primary key and the uniqueness
