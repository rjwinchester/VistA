Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch includes several enhancements to the Clinical Case Registries 
 (CCR) package.  These changes include:
  
    1. Eight new local registries were added including the following
       functionality:
        a. The set up and initial build of the new registries.
        b. Adding the new registries to the nightly job that searches for
           and adds patients to them, based on registry-specific
           International Classification of Disease, 9th edition (ICD-9) 
           and  International Classification of Disease, 10th edition
           (ICD-10) codes.
        c. The addition of the number of reports run for each new registry
           in the nightly HL7 message.
        d. The standard local reports currently available in CCR will be
           available for the new registries.
  
    2. Removal of the requirement that a Hepatitis C GT lab test must be
       specified in the site parameters before the Potential DAA Candidates
       report can be run.
  
    3. Addition of new HIV antibody and antigen codes to the VA HIV 
       registry.
  
    4. Addition of new LOINC codes to the Hepatitis C registry antibody 
       search.
  
    5. Addition of a new report SUSTAINED VIROLOGIC RESPONSE for the 
       Hepatitis C registry.
  
    6. Modifications have been made to copy CCR application help files to 
       the local workstation when CCR is accessed on a server or network.
  
    7. Additional modifications have been made to bring the CCR GUI into
       compliance with Section 508 standards.
  
    8. The version of the CCR software was updated to 1.5.24.

 Patch Installation Overview:
 ============================ 
  
 This patch includes an M patch and a revised Graphical User Interface
 (GUI) executable.
  
 Below is a summary of the installation steps required for this patch.
  
 1.  Install M components.
 2.  Update GUI.
   
   
 Patch Installation:
 ------------------
  
 M INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ----------------------------
 Installation of the patch will not take more than 5 minutes. This patch
 can be installed with VistA users online, but Registry users should be
 logged out of the CCR Registry Application, as a new GUI is to be
 installed. There are no options that need to be disabled prior to patch
 install.
  
 NOTE: The nightly task (Registry Update & Data Extraction [ROR TASK] 
 option) must not be running during the installation.
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 The pre-installation routine for this patch checks to be sure the task 
 Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE] is not running.  If 
 it is, the user is informed of the task number found and that the job 
 must finish or be terminated before the patch can be installed.  The 
 patch installation then exits, incomplete.  Routine name is PRE^RORP024.
  
 The post-installation routine for this patch is POST^RORP024 and performs 
 the following functions:
  
   - Adds the new report Sustained Virologic Response to the VA HEPC entry 
     the ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS file (#798.1)
   - Adds new LOINC codes to the VA HEPC entry in the ROR REGISTRY 
     PARAMETERS file (#798.1)
   - Adds new registries to the ROR ICD SEARCH file (#798.5) along with 
     their corresponding diagnosis codes
   - Schedules the Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE]
     option to run. 
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 The post-initialization routine for this patch schedules the Initialize 
 new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE] task to run.  During the 
 installation, there are a series of questions that must be answered that 
 will be used to schedule this task.
  
 The parameters that are acquired from the install questions are as 
 follows:
  
 Maximum number of registry update subtasks:
   [valid response is a number 0-10]
  
 Suspend the post-install during the peak hours:
   [valid response is Yes/No]
    If the answer to this question is Yes, then the following 2 questions 
    must be answered:
  
       Suspension start time:
         [valid response is any valid time input]
  
       Suspension end time:
         [valid response is any valid time input occurring after the start 
          time]
  
  Date/Time to run the new registry initialize task:
   [valid response is a date/time that is at least 15 minutes in the 
    future.]
   
  
 Installation steps:
 ------------------
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch 
     designation 'ROR*1.5*24':
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//'     
     
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//'
  
 7.  The post-initialization routine for this patch schedules the
     Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE] task to run
     as well as updating some of the CCR files as described above.
