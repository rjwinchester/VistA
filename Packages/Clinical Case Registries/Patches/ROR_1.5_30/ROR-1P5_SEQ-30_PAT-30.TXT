Description:
============

 This patch includes several enhancements and corrections to the Clinical
 Case Registries (CCR) package.  These changes include:
   
 1.     Two new local registries added: (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) 
 Registry - VA IPF, Hypoparathyroidism - VA HYPOPARA) including the following
 functionality:
  
           a. The set up and initial build of the new registries.
           b. Adding the new registries to the nightly job that searches
              for and adds patients to them, based on registry-specific
              International Classification of Disease, 9th edition (ICD-9),
              International Classification of Disease, 10th edition
              (ICD-10) procedure codes and Current Procedural Technology 
              (CPT) procedure codes.
           c. The standard local reports currently available in CCR will be
              available for the new registries.
   
 2. It was discovered that the Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B reports were not 
 finding all patients who have laboratory documented immunity.   HCV and HIV 
 labs have always used upper case searches for positive LOINC results 
 so results entered in mixed case were missed.  The code has been modified 
 to change all positive LOINC results to upper case. 
  
 3.     The caption on the Sex panel has been modified from Sex to Birth Sex.
  The output for the report headers and report columns were modified 
 appropriately.
  
 4.     One new medication had been added to the ROR GENERIC DRUG file
         (#799.51) to be used as inclusion criteria for patients in the
         respective registry(s).
           a.     HEP C registry: SOFOSBUVIR/VELPATASVIR
  
 5.     The warning on the Potential DAA Candidates report will be updated 
 to  remove the reference  to genotype 1, as the report no longer requires 
 genotype 1.
  
 6.     Additional CCR GUI updates were made to work towards becoming fully 
 compliant with the Section 508Section_508 standards.
  
 7.      The version of the CCR software has been updated to 1.5.30.

  Patch Installation Overview:
  ============================ 
   
  This patch includes an M patch and a revised Graphical User Interface
  (GUI) executable.
   
  Below is a summary of the installation steps required for this patch.
   
  1.  Install M components.
  2.  Update GUI.
    
    
  Patch Installation:
  ------------------
   
  M INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ----------------------------
  Installation of the patch will not take more than 5 minutes. This patch
  can be installed with VistA users online, but Registry users should be
  logged out of the CCR Registry Application, as a new GUI is to be
  installed. There are no options that need to be disabled prior to patch
  install.
   
  NOTE: The nightly task (Registry Update & Data Extraction [ROR TASK] 
  option) must not be running during the installation.
   
  Pre/Post Installation Overview:
  -------------------------------
  The pre-installation routine for this patch checks to be sure the task 
  Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE] is not running.  
  If it is, the user is informed of the task number found and that the job
  must finish or be terminated before the patch can be installed.  The 
  patch installation then exits, incomplete.  Routine name is PRE^RORP030.
   
  The post-installation routine for this patch is POST^RORP030 and 
  performs the following functions:
   
     
     - Schedules the Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE]
       option to run. If the new registries included in the patch have
       already been initialized, the user can opt not to re-do the 
       initialize for each registry.
  
     - Adds eight entries to the ROR LIST ITEM file (#799.1) for each of the
       new registries added with this patch.
  
     - Adding CPT and ICD-9 procedures to ROR ICD SEARCH file
       for new registries")
  
   
  Installation Instructions:
  --------------------------
  The post-initialization routine for this patch schedules the Initialize 
  new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE] task to run.  During the 
  installation process, you will be presented with a series of questions
  that must be answered that will be used to schedule this task.
  
  The following questions provide the parameters needed to schedule
  this task:
   
  Maximum number of registry update subtasks:
    [valid response is a number 0-10]
   
  Suspend the post-install during the peak hours:
    [valid response is Yes/No]
     If the answer to this question is Yes, then the following 2 questions 
     must be answered:
   
        Suspension start time:
          [valid response is any valid time input]
   
        Suspension end time:
          [valid response is any valid time input occurring after the 
           start time]
   
   Date/Time to run the new registry initialize task:
    [valid response is a date/time that is at least 15 minutes in the 
     future.]
    
  
 If this patch needs to be re-installed after the new registries have been 
 initialized, the following will be prompted to allow this step to be skipped
 for each of the new registries:
  
     >> New registry <registry name (internal entry number of registry)>
  has already completed initialization
  Do you want to rerun its initialization?: NO// 
  
 Once initialized, do not respond YES to this prompt unless you are
 requested to do so by the CCR team.
  
  
  Installation steps:
  ------------------
   
  1. Unschedule or delete the Registry Update & Data Extraction [ROR
     TASK] job (CCR nightly job) from the Schedule/Unschedule Options
     [XUTM SCHEDULE] in Taskman.
  
  2. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
   
  3.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
  4.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
      following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the 
      patch designation 'ROR*1.5*30':
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.    It is
          recommended this step be done as it will be needed if a rollback
          is required for this patch in the future.
      b.  **Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
  
       ** Note that for this patch, this option will produce a system
       error due to the known problem with Fileman not correctly
       handling the lookup to a file with no B cross reference.
       There is currently no workaround for this problem.
       The error expected to be produced is:
       I C["P",$D(@("^"_$P(^(0),U,3)_"0)")) S C=$P(^(0),U,2)
       Q:'$D(^(+Y,0))  S Y=$P(^(0),U) I $D(^DD(+C,.01,0)) S
       C=$P(^(0),U,2) G S
       <SYNTAX>S+1^DIQ
  
       This issue does not affect the installation of the CCR patch.
       The patch will install without issue.^
  
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
       
  5.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
      choose the patch to install.
   
  6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      NO//', respond NO
  
  7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? NO//', respond NO
  
  8.  The post-initialization routine for this performs the following 
      functions:
          a. Updates data in the following files:
                 ROR REGISTRY PARAMETERS (#798.1)
                 
          b. Adds eight entries to the ROR LIST ITEM file (#799.1) for each
             of the new registries added with this patch.
  
    
          
          c. Schedules the Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR 
             INITIALIZE] option to run. This task sets up and populates the
             5 new registries added with this patch.
  
          d. You must periodically (at least once per day) check the status
             of the Initialize new registries (one time) [ROR INITIALIZE]
             job.  When it has successfully completed, you must restart the
             Registry Update & Data Extraction [ROR TASK] job.
