Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_Prod_Overview_Guide_Groups_5_6_7.pdf) posted on the 
 Anonymous directory for installation order. This is critical for proper
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the implementation date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
 systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
 which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research. 
  
 The following functionality within the Clinical Case Registries (CCR)
 application was updated to address the ICD-10 code set.
  
 1. Registry update process has been changed so that Reason for Selection
     for a patient added to a Registry can also be ICD-10 code in
     outpatient file, ICD-10 code in Outpatient Encounter file (409.68), 
     ICD-10 code in the PTF file (45) or ICD-10 code in Problem List
     package.
     
  
 2. Registry update process for historical encounters has been modified. 
     For historical encounters, Date of Interest for determining Coding
     System is the visit creation date instead of the visit date.
  
 3. ICD-10 diagnoses and ICD-10 procedure codes can be searched for in the 
     ROR Report parameters.
  
 4. ICD-10 diagnoses codes can be saved in Your Templates along with 
     ICD-9 diagnoses codes.
  
 5. Common Templates have been updated to include ICD-10 codes. Note:   
     The Pre-install routine saves the current Common Templates for 180
     days in ^XTMP("RORP19",$J) global before updating them with ICD-9 and
     ICD-10 codes. If a Common Template has been modified, it will be
     overwritten with the original ICD-9 codes and new ICD-10 codes.
  
 6. Reports show ICD-10 diagnoses and procedure codes.
  
 7. CCR Registry information that is sent to the National Database via Health
     Level (HL7) messages now can differentiate between ICD-9 and ICD-10
     diagnosis codes.
  
 8. RPC call ROR LIST ICD-9 was removed and replaced by ROR LIST ICD. ROR LIST
     ICD is now linked to option ROR GUI.
