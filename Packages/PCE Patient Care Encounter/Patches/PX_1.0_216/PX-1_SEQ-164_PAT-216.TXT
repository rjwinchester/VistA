Description:
============

 The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) Immunizations Enhancements (VIMM) 2.0 project, Increment 4, builds
 upon the file structures and standardized data introduced in Increments 1,
 2 and 3 by adding functional enhancements to the existing VistA Patient
 Care Encounter (PCE) package.
  
 This patch provides the following new features:
  
 1) Introduces a new file, V IMMUNIZATION DELETED (#9000080.11), that will
    contain entries that were deleted out of the V IMMUNIZATION file
    (#9000010.11). Immediately prior to deleting an entry from the V
    IMMUNIZATION file, a copy of the record will be made and filed to the V
    IMMUNIZATION DELETED file. The date/time of deletion and the user that
    deleted the record will be recorded.
  
 2) Creates Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) for use by the Enterprise Health
    Management Platform (eHMP) project, the Computerized Patient Record
    System (CPRS) software and others. These RPCs retrieve skin test
    information from the following files:
     - V SKIN TEST (#9000010.12)
     - SKIN TEST (#9999999.28) 
     - IMM ADMINISTRATION SITE (BODY) (#920.3)
  
 3) Creates a RPC to retrieve immunization data from the V IMMUNIZATION
    (#9000010.11) file. This data will be used in the future to retrieve
    patient immunization data and transmit it, using the Health Level 7
    (HL7) standard protocol, to external agencies (e.g., State Immunization
    Information Registries). As part of this effort, a new option will be
    introduced with this patch, Accounting Of Immunization Disclosures
    Report [PXV IMM DISCLOSURE REPORT], that can be run from the PCE
    Coordinator Menu [PX PCE COORDINATOR MENU]. This option can be used to
    generate a list of immunization records transmitted to external
    agencies. This option allows for a date range selection as well as one,
    multiple or all agencies and one, multiple or all patients.
  
 4) Previously, auditing has been turned on for all fields of the V 
    IMMUNIZATION (#9000010.11) file. Additional safe guards are added to
    ensure auditing is not turned off and the data audits cannot be purged
    for the V IMMUNIZATION file.
  
 5) The existing immunization inventory functionality is updated to 
    include multi-divisional features:
     - Inventory items may be linked to an associated facility.
     - Inventory reports are facility specific.
    
 6) The immunization entry process is updated to require the entry of 
    Dose, Dose Units, Route of Administration and Site of Administration 
    (Note: If route is ORAL, site is not required.).
    
 7) The PX SAVE DATA remote procedure call (RPC) has been modified to 
    provide support for the following fields in the V SKIN TEST file
    (#9000010.12):
     - READER (#.07)
     - ORDERING PROVIDER (#1202)
     - ANATOMIC LOCATION OF PLACEMENT (#1212)
     - READING COMMENTS (#1301)
    
 8) The functionality for the Health Summary component PCE IMMUNIZATIONS
    (IM) is modified to ignore time and occurrence limits, basically
    restoring pre-patch PX*1*210 behavior.
  
 9) Provides an alert whenever specific allergy-type contraindications are
    recorded, as a reason for not giving an immunization, in the V IMM
    CONTRA/REFUSAL EVENTS file (#9000010.707). The alert text reads: "You
    have recorded an allergy/adverse reaction contraindication reason. This
    information should also be recorded in the Adverse Reaction Tracking
    package if it is not already present there."

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 The pre-installation process deletes the trigger cross-reference from the
 EVENT DATE AND TIME (#1201) field of the V IMMUNIZATION (#9000010.11)
 file. The trigger will be moved to the IMMUNIZATION (#.01) field. The
 trigger sets the DATE/TIME RECORDED (#1205) field.
  
 The post-installation process sets a node in the V IMMUNIZATION data
 dictionary (DD) that prevents a user from being able to purge data audits
 for the V IMMUNIZATION file.
