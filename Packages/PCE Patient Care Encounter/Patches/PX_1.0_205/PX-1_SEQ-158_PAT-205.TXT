Category:

Description:
============

 Patch PX*1*205 addresses the following Patient Care Encounter issues:
  
  1. Users are receiving an Audit trail undefined error.
  2. An error (OCC+40^PXBGPRV) is generated when a person class with no 
     VA code is assigned to a provider.
  3. There is No CHECK for non-unique names when editing Health 
     Factors.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC000000854295 - Patient Care Encounter - General: Audit trail undefined
                      error
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The AUDIT TRAIL field (#80102) of the V POV file (#9000010.07) can have an
 audit trail with a value of "+". The "+" is added when there are greater than 5
 audit trail strings. Its purpose is to delineate the 1st audit trail from the
 last 3 audit trails. Any additional audit trails are eliminated from the string
 and replaced with the "+" so that the string of audit trails does not become
 too long. This is done in routine PXKMAIN1. An error occurs in routine PXQFV
 when the audit trail information is encoded and prepared for display. The "+"
 is invalid as an audit trail string and the error AUDIT+9^PXQFV occurs.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The routine PXQFV has been modified to check each audit trail string before
 processing and it will now ignore the "+".
  
    Routine: PXQFV
  
  
 2. INC000000362063 - 2 Error OCC+40^PXBGPRV
  
 Problem:
 ======== 
 If you assign a provider a PERSON CLASS field (#8932.1) in the NEW PERSON file
 (#200) that has no VA CODE field (#5) in the PERSON CLASS file (#8932.1), then
 this means that the provider is an agency, supplier, etc., rather than a
 healthcare professional. If that provider is used as a provider in an encounter
 for a patient then an error occurs.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Code was added to the PXBPPRV1 routine to display a warning message to the
 screen if there is no VA CODE for the active PERSON CLASS for a provider. This
 follows the current system functionality for another PERSON CLASS problem that
 occurs when none of the person classes for the chosen provider are active on
 the encounter date.
  
    Routine: PXBPPRV1
  
  
 3. INC000000605292 - No CHECK for non-unique names on editing Health Factors
  
 Problem:
 ======== 
 If you use the PCE TABLE MAINTENANCE [PXTT TABLE MAINTENANCE] option to edit a
 table (Education Topic, Examinations, Health Factors, Immunizations, Skin Test,
 or Treatments) it allows you to modify the NAME (#.01) field to match one 
 that already exists resulting in a duplicate. It allows this for local 
 table entries but not national table entries.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The PXTTU1 routine was modified to check for and not allow duplicate names for
 local entries as well as national entries.
  
    Routine: PXTTU1
