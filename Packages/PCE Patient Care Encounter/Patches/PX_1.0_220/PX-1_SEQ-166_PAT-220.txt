 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:

 1. R18136943FY18 - Class one autoverify has stopped working for Fargo. 
    When trying to manually verify results, users get kicked out of VISTA.
  
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A runtime error occurs during Lab Auto-Verification or when the
    menu option Enter/verify data (auto instrument) [LRVR] is run and the
    selected provider does not have a VA CODE (#5) field found in the
    PERSON CLASS (#8932.1) file. PERSON CLASS (#8932.1) file entries
    without a VA CODE (#5) field are only considered providers if their VA
    CODE (#5) field is defined; otherwise they are considered agencies.
    The PCE function $$OCCUP^PXBGPRV was not designed to handle the PERSON 
    CLASS (#8932.1) file entries without a VA CODE (#5) field. This
    prevents the variable TYPE from being defined, causing a runtime error.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Updated $$OCCUP^PXBGPRV to validate that the variable TYPE is defined.
    If it is not, the appropriate error code/message will be returned in
    order to prevent a runtime error. This will prevent VistA from crashing
    when an incorrect provider without a VA CODE (#5) field has been
    selected.
