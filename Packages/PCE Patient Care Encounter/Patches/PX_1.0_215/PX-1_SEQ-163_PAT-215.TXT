Description:
============

 Note: Patch PSN*4*448 must be installed before installing patch PX*1*215.
  
 The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) Immunizations Enhancements (VIMM) 2.0 project, Increment 3, builds
 upon the file structures and standardized data introduced in Increments 1
 and 2 by adding functional enhancements to the existing VistA Patient Care
 Encounter (PCE) package.
  
 This patch provides the following new features:
  
 1) Creates Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) for use by the Enterprise Health
    Management Platform (eHMP) project, the Computerized Patient Record
    System (CPRS) software, Data Access Service (DAS) and others. These
    RPCs retrieve immunization information from the following files:
    - VACCINE INFORMATION STATEMENT (#920)
    - IMMUNIZATION INFO SOURCE (#920.1)
    - IMM ADMINISTRATION ROUTE (#920.2)
    - IMM ADMINISTRATION SITE (BODY) (#920.3)
    - IMM CONTRAINDICATION REASONS (#920.4)
    - IMM REFUSAL REASONS (#920.5)
    - V IMM CONTRA/REFUSAL EVENTS (#9000010.707)
    - IMM MANUFACTURER (#9999999.04)
    - IMMUNIZATION (#9999999.14)
    - IMMUNIZATION LOT (#9999999.41)
    - IMM DEFAULT RESPONSES (#920.05)
  
 2) Introduces functionality for capturing the reason(s) an immunization
    was not given by documenting immunization contraindications and/or
    refusal events. This functionality includes the following:
    - Creation of the V IMM CONTRA/REFUSAL EVENTS file (#9000010.707)
    - A WARNING UNTIL DATE may be stored for temporary 
    contraindications/refusals. This is the date until which the 
    contraindication/refusal is valid.
    - When an immunization for a patient is associated with valid 
    contraindications/refusals (WARNING UNTIL DATE is not a past date), 
    the software will display a warning and the user will be required to 
    acknowledge the warning and enter a justification reason before 
    continuing with administration.
  
 3) Inactivates the functionality of the PCE CODE MAPPING file (#811.1).
    The file will still exist, but the mappings in the file will no longer
    be used to determine which related entries in the V IMMUNIZATION
    (#9000010.11), V SKIN TEST (#9000010.12), and V CPT (#9000010.18) files
    need to automatically be recorded. From now on, the mappings in the
    CODING SYSTEM multiple of the IMMUNIZATION (#9999999.14) and SKIN TEST
    (#9999999.28) files will be used for this purpose. There are a few
    differences with this new approach:
      a) The PCE CODE MAPPING file was managed locally, while the CODING
         SYSTEM multiple of the IMMUNIZATION and SKIN TEST files are
         standardized and managed nationally.
      b) Mappings to ICD-10 codes will now be supported. If an immunization
         or skin test is mapped to an ICD-10 code, when that immunization
         or skin test is documented, it will automatically file the mapped
         ICD-10 code to the V POV file (#9000010.07).
      c) Stop the practice of automatically recording an immunization or
         skin test when a corresponding CPT code is filed. The mappings
         will only be used to automatically file the corresponding codes
         (CPT and ICD-10) when an immunization or skin test is documented.
         However, in the reverse scenario, when a CPT code is documented,
         it will not automatically record the corresponding immunization or
         skin test.
      d) Codes will only automatically be filed when a VA-administered
         (non-historical) immunization or skin test is documented.
  
 4) Functionality to enable a documenting provider to view some
    immunization prompts with default values to accept and edit the
    responses if needed. This functionality includes: 
    - Creation of the IMM DEFAULT RESPONSES file (#920.05) to store
    facility specific default values by immunization type for ROUTE OF
    ADMINISTRATION, SITE OF ADMINISTRATION, DOSE, DOSE UNITS, and COMMENTS.
    - Creation of the Immunization Default Responses Enter/Edit menu option
    [PXV EDIT DEFAULT RESPONSES] gives authorized users the ability to
    enter or update information in the IMM DEFAULT RESPONSES file
    (#920.05).
  
 5) Updates the NDC CODE (VA) field (#.18) in the IMMUNIZATION LOT file
    (#9999999.41) so access to information in the NDC/UPN file (#50.67) is
    controlled by application programmer interfaces (APIs).

 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ---------------------------------------------------- 
 Software being released as a host file and/or documentation describing 
 the new functionality introduced by this patch are available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using Secure
 File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the
 following OI Field Offices:
    
 Albany:                 domain.ext
 Hines:                  domain.ext

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 The post-installation process will generate a report from the PCE CODE 
 MAPPING file (#811.1) for review. The report will contain all active
 mappings where either a) an inactive immunization was mapped to a CPT
 code; or b) a CPT code was mapped to an immunization or skin test. The
 report will be emailed to the user who installed the patch and to the mail
 group specified in the REMINDER MANAGEMENT MAILGROUP field (#3) of the 
 CLINICAL REMINDER PARAMETERS file (#800). The report will also be sent to
 the VHA National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP)
 for review. If it is determined that patient charts may have been affected
 with erroneous data prior to the inactivating of the PCE CODE MAPPING file
 with this patch, the site will be contacted and instructed to submit a
 help desk ticket for resolution.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 Patch PSN*4*448 must be installed before installing patch PX*1*215.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch should be installed during a period of minimal system activity,
 preferably with users off the system. Installation time is expected to be
 approximately 10 minutes.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu. From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch 
     # (PX*1.0*215):
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
     d. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
        components of the KIDS build.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install. Enter PX*1.0*215.
