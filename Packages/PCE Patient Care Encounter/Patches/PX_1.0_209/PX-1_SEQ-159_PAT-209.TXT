Subject: ENHANCEMENTS TO PX SAVE DATA RPC

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch includes updates to the PX SAVE DATA Remote Procedure Call 
 (RPC) and to the DATA2PCE^PXAPI Application Program Interface (API) to 
 support additional immunization fields.
  
 o The following immunization fields have been added to the PCELIST array 
   parameter of the PX SAVE DATA RPC: CVX Code (placeholder), Event
   Information Source, Dosage, Route of Administration, Site of
   Administration, Lot number, Manufacturer, and Expiration Date. The new
   fields are optional, and the changes are backward compatible. See the 
   Patient Care Encounter (PCE) Technical Manual for a full description of 
   this RPC.
  
 o The following immunization fields have been added to the INPUTROOT array
   parameter of the DATA2PCE API: Lot Number, Event Information Source,
   Route of Administration, Site of Administration, and Dosage. The new
   fields are optional, and the changes are backward compatible. See the 
   Patient Care Encounter (PCE) Technical Manual for a full description of 
   this API.
  
 o A defect was found where if an immunization SERIES which was greater 
   than the MAX # IN SERIES field (#.05) in the IMMUNIZATION file 
   (#9999999.14) was passed into the DATA2PCE API, the SERIES and
   subsequent immunization fields would fail to file. This patch modifies
   the API, so as long as the SERIES value passed in is one of the
   set-of-codes defined for the field, the DATA2PCE API will file it.
