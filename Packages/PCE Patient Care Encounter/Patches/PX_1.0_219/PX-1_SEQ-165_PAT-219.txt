  CA SDM OVERVIEW:
  ================
   
  1. R16254145FY17 - User is allowed to use an earlier date as the End date
   
     Problem:
     --------
     A user can enter an End Date that is prior to the Start Date and the
     application will switch the dates for the range and gives no   
     indication to the user the dates were switched. This issue issue 
     occurs in the following PXCE options:
  
     PCE Encounter Data Entry [PXCE ENCOUNTER DATA ENTRY]
     PCE Encounter Data Entry and Delete [PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY & DELETE]
     PCE Encounter Data Entry without Delete [PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY NO
     DELETE]
     PCE Encounter Data Entry - Supervisor [PXCE ENCOUNTER ENTRY SUPER]
     PCE Encounter Viewer [PXCE ENCOUNTER VIEWER]
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Use the RANGE^VALM11 Utility to verify the date range input is correct
     and in logical order. If the date range is not in logical order the
     user is prompted to re-enter the date range values.
