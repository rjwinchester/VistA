Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch PX*1*204 addresses the following Patient Care Encounter 
 (PCE) issues:
  
  1. Users are receiving (ADD+3^AUPNVSIT errors), which are preventing
     the transmission of data.
  2. An error (<UNDEFINED> EVISITDT+23^PXCEVSIT) occurs in the 
     Encounter Data Entry process.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC000000297492 - ADD+3^AUPNVSIT errors occur causing VASITE errors which
                      prevent AMBCARE transmission of data
  
 Problem:
 ========
 While a visit file entry is being set up by one process, another process 
 can kill the visit. The process that kills the visit checks the 
 dependency count to make sure that it is zero before it kills the visit
 but the first process has not yet updated it from zero to one, so the 
 kill is allowed. Then, the first process errors at line ADD+3 in routine
 AUPNVSIT because it cannot find the visit.
    
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A flag is set in routine AUPNVSIT before it checks for the existence of the 
 visit in preparation to update it. Routine VSITKIL checks for the flag and 
 if it exists it doesn't allow the visit to be killed. The second line of 
 routine AUPNVSIT was also modified to change the module of the routine from 
 VISIT TRACKING to PCE PATIENT CARE ENCOUNTER to reflect the proper
 ownership of the routine. Please see patch PX*1*76 for more information.
  
   Routines: AUPNVSIT & VSITKIL 
  
    
 2. INC000000710979 - PCE error:  <UNDEFINED> EVISITDT+23^PXCEVSIT  *VADM(6)
  
 Problem:
 ========
 A hard error occurs in the Encounter Data Entry process if you select by
 Clinic, use the List by Encounter view and try to use the Actions without first
 selecting a patient.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Code was added to the ENTRY ACTION of protocol PXCE NEW ENCOUNTER to prompt 
 for patient if one has not previously been selected. The code was added
 by post install routine PX1P204.  
  
   Old ENTRY ACTION: S PXCEVIEN="" D EN^PXCEVFIL("SIT")
   New ENTRY ACTION: S PXCEVIEN="" D SDSALONE^PXCEPAT D:$G(PXCEPAT)>0
                     EN^PXCEVFIL("SIT")
   Routine: PX1P204
