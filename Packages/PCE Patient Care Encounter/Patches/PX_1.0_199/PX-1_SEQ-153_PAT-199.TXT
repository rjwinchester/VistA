Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide posted on the 
 Anonymous directory for installation order. This is critical for proper 
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on 
 or after the implementation date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
 systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven alpha-
 numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, which 
 follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research.
  
 This patch prepares the Patient Care Encounter (PCE) package for 
 utilizing the ICD-10 codes when they become active. Forty-nine existing
 routines were modified, one routine which contains ICD-10 related
 utilities was added, two routines to control ICD-10 diagnosis look-up were
 added, and one pre-installation routine is included in the build. 
 Throughout the package, both in the M code and in the Data Dictionary, 
 instances of reference to ICD-9 were frequently changed to a generic 
 reference such as ICD or Diagnosis. The ICD-9 label is retained
 in a few places where only ICD-9 codes will be displayed. All reports 
 have been reformatted to accommodate the longer ICD-10 codes and the
 longer descriptions. Essentially though, the users should experience very
 little change. In addition, other VistA packages which utilize PCE services
 through API calls should experience no change in functionality. The API
 parameters for both Input and Output have remained the same.
   
 Example of the updated text changes where ICD-9 will now be generic:
  
 * * * * *
   
 Old:
     Associated Primary Diagnosis ICD9 Code not in File 80
  
 New:
     Associated Primary Diagnosis ICD Code not in File 80

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 This ICD-10 Remediation patch was not created as a result of any Remedy 
 Tickets however Remedy Ticket INC000000820913 was created to document 
 that PX*1.0*199 patch fixes a pre-existing condition as described 
 immediately below.
  
 PCE does not retrieve DG codes associated with the AICS encounter form 
 for the clinic being used.  (PCE Encounter Data Entry - Supervisor.  Go 
 to Check Out Interview)  This was found to be an error in logic by the 
 routine PXBGPOV4 in existing ICD-9 code.  The ICD10 Remediation 
 development team (HP) fixed this for both ICD9 and ICD10 in the PCE patch 
 PX*1.0*199.  We want the problem documented so that users are aware that 
 this is not an AICS problem and will be fixed when this PX*1.0*199 patch 
 gets loaded.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 This patch will run a brief pre-installation routine that will update the
 PXCE POV ADD protocol. The routine PX10P199 will not be automatically
 deleted. You may keep it or delete it per your local standards.
 There is no post-installation routine nor any special steps.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 1a) It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak hours. 
  
 1b) All steps leading up to the KIDS Installation may be done with the 
 users on the system. Users must be off of the system during the KIDS 
 installation. There is a long list of applications that use PCE services 
 to file data, and there is very real potential for errors to occur if 
 this is installed while those services are in use.
  
 1c) TaskMan must remain running but in a WAIT state for the duration of 
 the KIDS installation. Once the install is complete, restore TaskMan by 
 removing TaskMan from a WAIT state.
  
 1d) This patch should take less than ten (10) minutes to install.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 As noted above, users, background filers, CPRS RPC ports, etc.
 should be off the system, shut down or disabled before applying this
 patch. Approximately 30 packages utilize PCE services and over 50
 routines are being modified. To avoid <EDITED> errors and avoid
 database degradation the system must be quiescent.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch (PX*1.0*199).
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu. From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following option. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch #
     PX*1.0*199 :
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed. It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 5.  If prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//'     
       We recommend answering YES, unless your system rebuilds menu
     trees nightly using TaskMan or you are installing other patches 
     after this one for which you will also Rebuild Menu Trees.
     Answering YES will increase installation time and need only be done
     once after installing multiple patches.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//'
  
     You may answer NO since all users should be off the system anyway.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO// 
  
     You may answer NO since all users should be off the system anyway.
     
 8.  If prompted "Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0// respond 0.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
  
 There are no post-installation steps that need to be executed.
