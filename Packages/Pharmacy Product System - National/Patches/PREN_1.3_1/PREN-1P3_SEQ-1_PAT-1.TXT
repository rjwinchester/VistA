Subject: PPS-N 1.3 IAM/2FA Implementation INFORMATIONAL PATCH

Category: 
  - Informational
  - Other

Description:
============

 The Pharmacy Product System-National (PPS-N) is a Web-based application
 that provides the ability to manage pharmacy-specific data across the VA
 enterprise, ensuring that all facilities are using the same base data
 for their operations. It allows approved national VA personnel to easily,
 quickly, and safely manage the VA National Formulary which directs which
 products (such as medications and supplies) are to be purchased and used
 by the VA hospital system.
  
 The PPS-N application performs the following major business functions:
  
 * Add/edit/approve medication and supply information
 * Synchronize the PPS-N data with the legacy National Drug File (NDF)
   Management System (NDFMS) data
 * Output various reports
 * Process additions and updates from First DataBank (FDB)
 * Search for and add drug information from First DataBank
  
  
 In addition to synchronizing PPS-N with the NDFMS system, the PPS-N
 application also interfaces with the VA Enterprise Terminology Services
 (VETS) system (for Standard Medication Route information) and with the VA
 Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) system (for pricing data).
  
 In order to comply with the VA mandate on two factor authentication 
 (2FA), the PPS-N application has been integrated with IAM SSOi. The PPS-N 
 application code and configuration have been updated to work with the IAM 
 SSOi service for user authentication. The user roles management code in 
 PPS-N has also been modified to remove dependency on the VistA Security 
 keys for user authorization and use the PPS-N database tables to store 
 and manage user roles within the PECS application.
  
  
 PPS-N v1.3 also contains fixes for ten CA Service Desk Manager
 tickets.

 Problem:
 -----------
 The Department of Veterans Affairs Cybersecurity Task Force has been 
 tasked by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Inspector General 
 (IG) to address identified material weaknesses. This task force has 
 mandated that all internal, user facing VA applications become two factor 
 authentication (2FA) compliant by April 30, 2017. 
 In order to be compliant, applications are required to authenticate users 
 via Personal Id entry Verification (PIV) cards.  
 Note: Usernames and password will no longer be permitted for employees 
 and contractors to access VA applications.  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 As part of the transition to two factor authentication (2FA), the PPS-N 
 application code and configuration have been updated to work with the IAM 
 SSOi service for user authentication. The PPS-N application has also been 
 modified to remove dependency on the VistA Security keys for user 
 authorization and use the PPS-N database tables to store and manage user 
 roles within the PPS-N application.
