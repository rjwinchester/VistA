Subject: PPS-N 1.1.01 INFORMATIONAL PATCH

Category: 
  - Informational
  - Other

Description:
============

 The Pharmacy Product System-National (PPS-N) is a Web-based application
 that provides the ability to manage pharmacy-specific data across the VA
 enterprise, ensuring that all facilities are using the same base data
 for their operations. It allows approved national VA personnel to easily,
 quickly, and safely manage the VA National Formulary which directs which
 products (such as medications and supplies) are to be purchased and used
 by the VA hospital system.
  
 The PPS-N application performs the following major business functions:
  
 * Add/edit/approve medication and supply information
 * Synchronize the PPS-N data with the legacy National Drug File (NDF)
   Management System (NDFMS) data
 * Output various reports
 * Process additions and updates from First DataBank (FDB)
 * Search for and add drug information from First DataBank
  
  
  
 In addition to synchronizing PPS-N with the NDFMS system, the PPS-N
 application also interfaces with the VA Enterprise Terminology Services
 (VETS) system (for Standard Medication Route information) and with the VA
 Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) system (for pricing data).
  
 The purpose of this software product release is to replace the current 
 version, PPS-N v1.1, with an enhanced version, PPS-N v1.1.01, which 
 contains fixes for Nine remedy tickets.
