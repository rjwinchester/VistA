  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Medication Order Check Healthcare Application 
 (MOCHA) Enhancements 2 group of patches. A host file was created to 
 simplify installation at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities. 
 The host file MOCHA_ENH_2_GMRA_OR_PSJ_PSO.KID contains: PSJ*5*281, 
 PSO*7*411, OR*3*269 and GMRA*4*46. Additionally there is the stand alone 
 patch PSS*1*175 which must be installed before the combined build.
  
 Important: Recently released patch GMRA*4*48 contains an Allergy 
            Assessment Clean Up utility tool that produces a report that
            identifies discrepancies between the ADVERSE REACTION
            ASSESSMENT file (#120.86) and the PATIENT ALLERGIES file
            (#120.8). It is imperative that GMRA*4*48 be installed prior to
            the installation of GMRA*4*46 and its associated patches, and
            that all data discrepancies identified by GMRA*4*48 have been
            corrected. If not, then installing GMRA*4*46 and its associated
            patches may result in drug allergy order checks not displaying
            in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and pharmacy
            during the medication order entry processes.
  
 This patch will enable the Adverse Reaction Tracking package to return
 sign/symptom data with the medication order check message to the 
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and Pharmacy. It will also
 update the EN1^GMRADPT Application Programming Interface (API) to return
 adverse reaction data from the Health Data Repository (HDR) along with
 data stored locally.

 New Service Requests (NSRs)
 ----------------------------  
 20080334 CCDSS (CPRS) PSI mandated work 2009
 A Clinical decision Support System is being requested to further enhance 
 drug order checking to improve patient care and reduce costs. This request
 is to address work mandated as determined by Patient Safety Incident (PSI)
 evaluation.
  
  
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs)
 -----------------------------
 PSPO 457/2072
 The wrong reactant is displayed in the adverse reaction order check 
 message. The ordered drug is displayed as the causative agent. See 
 associated remedy tickets 130757, 173383 and 510151 for resolution.
  
 PSPO 2383
 During the drug-allergy order check process, the ordered drug's VA 
 CLASSIFICATION value is examined to determine if a patient will have a 
 reaction to the drug.  This examination looks at the first four 
 characters for non-analgesics and all five characters for analgesics.  
 For non-analgesics, if a patient's profile lists multiple drug classes 
 with the same first four characters as the ordered drug, only the last 
 drug class listed is returned.  Many times, the returned class is less 
 clinically important than the other classes on the list.  See associated 
 Remedy tickets 823464 and 453615 for resolution.
  
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 1. HD823464 Adverse Reaction Tracking - Alerts Issue:
    HD453615 4 Alert not being displayed with third drug added
  
 Problem:
 -------
 During the drug-allergy order check process for a non-analgesic, when the 
 VA CLASSIFICATION value is examined, only one drug class is returned.  
 Many times, the returned class is less clinically important than the 
 other classes on the list.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The code is modified to return all drug classes that are matched.
  
 2. HD130757 1 Wrong reactant displayed in allergy check pop-up window
    HD173383 pt with sulfa allergy received HCTZ
    HD510151 1 Misleading adverse reaction if order for Furosemide and pt 
             has allergy to Sulfa Drugs
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The wrong reactant is displayed in the adverse reaction order check 
 message. The ordered drug is displayed as the causative agent.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The adverse reaction order check message is modified to correctly display 
 the causative agent from the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8).

 ----------

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions
 ------------------------------------ 
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve the files from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directory on download.vista.domain.ext using secure file transfer protocol
 (SFTP). This transmits the files from the first available SFTP server.
 Sites may also elect to retrieve the files directly from a specific server
 as follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Hines          ftp.domain.ext   <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library
