Description:
============

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Interagency Program Office (IPO)
 and the Department of Defense (DoD) is tasked by its charter with
 leading the Departments' efforts "to implement national health data
 standards for interoperability and [be] responsible for establishing,
 monitoring, and approving the clinical and technical standards profile
 and processes to ensure a seamless [exchange] of health data." This task
 of Native Domain standardization is aligned with achieving the goals
 outlined in the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requiring
 that the Departments' "healthcare data [are] computable in real-time and
 [comply] with existing national data standards" and that the "data [are]
 standardized as national standards continue to evolve." 
  
 Historically, VA clinicians used free text or non-standardized clinical
 terminologies entries within the healthcare information system for data
 recording, storage and utilization.  The purpose of the Native Domain
 Standardization project is to improve this process and allow a
 streamlined method for data sharing, performing clinical decision
 support, and engaging in national data reporting and analysis. The VA
 has recently established a standard terminology for the exchange of data
 within the allergies domain.  In a prior effort, the pertinent Allergies
 files were associated with terms using the approved standard terminology
 methods.  The two files being addressed in this effort, GMR ALLERGIES
 (#120.82) and SIGNS/SYMPTOMS (#120.83), include the following
 classification of terms: Medication and Non-Medication Reactants and
 Reactions.
    
 RxNorm is a naming system for generic and branded drugs/ingredients
 and a tool for supporting semantic interoperation between drug
 terminologies and pharmacy knowledge base systems such as Allergies.
 The National Library of Medicine (NLM) produces RxNorm.
  
 The terminology selection utilizes the following order:
 1.   Medication Reactants classification is RxNorm.
 2.   Non-Medication Reactants is RxNorm if available.
 3.   If not in RxNorm then the Unique Ingredient Identifier (UNII)
      coding system.
 4.   If not available in UNII, then Systematized Nomenclature of
      Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) coding system.
 5.   If none of the prior coding systems were suitable, then the
      term will be considered unmappable.
  
 For the Reactions classification of terms, the SNOMED-CT coding
 system will be utilized.
   
 The system will include one new field that will incorporate standard
 terminology code data from the respective Standards Development
 Organizations (SDO) to the GMR ALLERGIES (#120.82) and SIGNS/SYMPTOMS
 (#120.83) files. These new fields will be set as a multiple in order
 to accommodate the potential need to store multiple codes to define
 a given term.
  
 The entirety of the work within the scope of this effort is strictly
 non-functional in nature and will have no impact on Graphic User
 Interfaces (GUI) within the VA network, and will not impact the
 work-flow of clinicians.
