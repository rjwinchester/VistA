 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 -----------------------------
 PSPO 3222 Error PASS+10^GMRADPT *%("") received when the mechanism field 
           for an allergy is null.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 This error prevents users from receiving drug-allergy order check 
 messages when ordering or finishing medication orders. It also prevents 
 the display of adverse reactions in the Computerized Patient Record 
 System (CPRS).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 See the resolution for RTC 328799 below in the Defect Tracking System 
 Ticket(s) & Overview section.
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. RTC 281175 Free-Text Dosage Does Not Generate Adverse Reaction Order 
               Check Message
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Given a patient with a documented adverse reaction to a drug ingredient,
 when a provider orders a medication with that ingredient in the 
 computerized patient record system (CPRS) and enters a free text dosage,
 the adverse reaction order check message is not displayed in CPRS (the
 order check message does display during the pharmacy order finishing
 process).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 After installing this patch, the adverse reaction order check
 message will display in CPRS.
  
 2. RTC 300867 Drug-Allergy Order Check Messages for Local and Remote 
               Reactions are Not Combined
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Given a patient with a local observed reaction to a drug with no severity
 and a remote observed reaction to the same drug, when a provider orders a
 medication that could cause an adverse reaction, two separate drug-allergy
 order check messages are displayed in CPRS.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 After installing this patch, one combined order check message (showing
 data from both the local and remote reactions) will display in CPRS.
  
 3. RTC 328799 Error <SUBSCRIPT>PASS+10^GMRADPT *%("")
    I9074984FY16 subscript/undefined errors after MOCHA enhancement 
                 patches installation 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When retrieving a list of patient allergies for building the CWAD (Crisis 
 notes, clinical Warnings, Allergies and advanced Directive) string 
 displayed in the Postings button in the CPRS header bar, a subscript 
 error is generated for reactions that have no value for the MECHANISM 
 (#17) field in the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8). This error prevents 
 the Postings button from correctly displaying the patient's CWAD string, 
 prevents CPRS from displaying adverse reactions and prevents the 
 drug-allergy order check from functioning. In Pharmacy, it prevents users 
 from finishing orders.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 After installing this patch, the error is no longer generated for adverse 
 reactions that have no value for the MECHANISM (#17) field.
