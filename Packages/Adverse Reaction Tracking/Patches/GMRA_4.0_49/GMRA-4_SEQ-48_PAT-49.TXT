Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch GMRA*4.0*49 addresses the following two issues:
  
 1. Excessive number of entries in the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8)
    causes issues with the allergy HL7 messages.
  
 2. Embedded carriage returns in some old allergy HL7 messages prevented 
    the messages from being sent.

 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 1. INC0000000981450 MARK ID BAND FLAG site parameter check
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Routine GMRAMCU0 doesn't check the MARK ID BAND FLAG site parameter 
 before the calls are made to add multiples to the ID BAND MARKED field 
 (#14) in the PATIENT ALLERGY file (#120.8). The routine is called every
 time a wristband is printed. This sometimes leads to an excessive number
 of entries in the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8) which causes issues with
 the allergy HL7 messages.
    
 Solution:
 ---------                     
 Modified routine GMRAMCU0 to check the MARK ID BAND FLAG site parameter 
 before adding multiples to the ID BAND MARKED field (#14) in the PATIENT 
 ALLERGY file (#120.8). 
  
 Routine: GMRAMCU0 
  
 2. INC0000000291735 CARRIAGE RETURNS in HL7 Allergy Messages
  
 Problem:
 --------
 There might be some old patient allergy HL7 messages that may have never 
 made it to the Health Data Repository (HDR) because of embedded carriage
 returns. The carriage returns are no longer an issue but the old messages
 need to be identified and resent.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Since these messages were purged years ago, we will create a report that 
 will identify patient allergies with carriage returns embedded in the 
 comments field as part of this patch. The report will include the patient 
 DFN, Patient Allergy IEN, and Reactant. The report will be printed to the 
 screen and sent to the person installing the patch, all holders of the 
 GMRA-ALLERGY VERIFY security key, as well as Pharmacy Benefits Management 
 Services. Any carriage returns (as well as line feeds which usually 
 follow the carriage returns) found will be automatically converted to a 
 space by the patch. Records for patients that are deceased will be 
 excluded. The sites for which this report returns records will need to 
 review them and edit these patient allergy records to trigger a new HL7 
 message to HDR. Use the GMRA PATIENT A/AR EDIT [Enter/Edit Patient 
 Reaction Data] option to select the affected records then accept all 
 existing values. This will update the data in HDR.
  
 The post-install message will appear in your MailMan IN Basket like below:
  
 If the report returned records with carriage returns: (Note the "ACTION 
 REQUIRED" preceding the Subject)
  
 *=New/!=Priority.......Subject.....................From...................
 *21.ACTION REQUIRED GMRA*4*49 Post-Install Results GMRA*4.0*49 POST 
 INSTALL
  
 The appropriate staff at each site will need to follow the instructions in
 the MailMan message to trigger a new HL7 message to HDR and notify 
 Pharmacy Benefits Management Services (send message to
 Silverman.Robert@FORUM.DOMAIN.EXT) when this has been completed.
  
 If the report returned records with carriage returns: (Note the subject 
 is NOT preceded with "ACTION REQUIRED")
  
 *=New/!=Priority.......Subject.....................From...................
 *21.GMRA*4*49 Post-Install Results GMRA*4.0*49 POST INSTALL
  
 If the message is NOT preceded with "ACTION REQUIRED" there should be no
 records on the report in the message and NO FURTHER ACTION is required.
