Description:
============

 Patch GMRA*4.0*59 enables the VistA Adverse Reaction Tracking (ART) 
 package to generate a real-time VistA MailMan bulletin when allergy or 
 adverse reaction information is entered into the Computerized Patient 
 Record System (CPRS). The patch modifies routines GMRAMCB and GMRAGUI1 to 
 send the bulletin to the existing GMRA MARK CHART mail group when 
 providers enter allergy/adverse reaction information in the CPRS "Enter 
 Allergy or Adverse Reaction" window, accessed from either the CPRS Orders 
 tab or Cover Sheet. The bulletin provides a reminder that the patient 
 chart must be updated with the allergy/adverse reaction information 
 displayed in the bulletin message.

 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------ 
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option. The message containing the 
 backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at 
 the Message Action prompt. The PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE is 
 then used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA system.

 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the GMRA routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the GMRA routines have been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain 
 the designation of patch GMRA*4.0*59 on line 2 in the patch list section.
