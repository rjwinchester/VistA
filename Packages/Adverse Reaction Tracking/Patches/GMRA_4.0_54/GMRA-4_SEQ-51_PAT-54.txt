 Service Desk Ticket Overview:
 =======================
  
 1. I7512203FY16 FDA report SUBSCRIPT error with non-VA drugs
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the Enter/Edit FDA Report Data option is used to generate an 
 FDA report for patients that have Non-VA drugs on file empty lines 
 are displayed for these drugs. When one of the empty lines is 
 selected a subscript error occurs. This is because there is no 
 existing functionality to handle non-VA drugs on these reports.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 The new functionality to handle Non-VA drugs when generating the FDA 
 report will be added with a future development patch. This patch 
 (GMRA*4.0*54) will eliminate the empty lines, remove the hard error, 
 and, when there are non-VA meds for the patient, display the 
 following message: "There are Non-VA Meds on this patient's profile. 
 Please review for possible manual inclusion in this report."
  
 Routine: GMRAPHR0
  
 2. R12765314FY17 Adverse Reaction Assessment update when no 
    previous Reaction Assessment value
  
 Problem:
 --------
  
 When attempting to update the Adverse Reaction Assessment records for 
 some patients using the Assessment clean up utility the update fails (two 
 question marks are returned and the Assessment value in the utility is 
 not updated). This occurs specifically for patients where there is an 
 existing record in the ADVERSE REACTION ASSESSMENT FILE (#120.86) but 
 there is no previous value in the REACTION ASSESSMENT field (#1).
  
 Solution:
 ---------
  
 The code has been updated to properly file the Adverse Reaction 
 Assessment update even when there is an existing record in the ADVERSE 
 REACTION ASSESSMENT FILE (#120.86) with no previous value in the REACTION 
 ASSESSMENT field (#1).
  
 Routine: GMRANKA
  
 3. I9175702FY16 Allergy file allows MECHANISM to be null
  
 Problem:
 --------
    
 The MECHANISM field (#17) in the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8) is 
 enforced in CPRS but not when entering allergies through VistA. The 
 null value has caused issues in the past and the value should be 
 enforced consistently.
  
  
 Solution:
 ---------                     
 The MECHANISM field (#17) will be a required field in VistA and will 
 match existing CPRS functionality.
  
 Routine: N/A (DD)
