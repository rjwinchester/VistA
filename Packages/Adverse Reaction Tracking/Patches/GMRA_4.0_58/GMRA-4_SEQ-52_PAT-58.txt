Subject: CAS-RXSU2 ENHANCEMENTS-SUPPRESS NON-DRUG INGREDIENT LEVEL ALERTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch has the following enhancements for Clinical Ancillary Services
 Project (CAS) - Pharmacy Safety Updates (RxSu) Phase 2.
  
  
 1. Suppress Non-Drug Ingredient-Level Alert
  
    Previously released patch GMRA*4*50 added a new alert when the DRUG 
    CLASSES field (#3) in the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8) is empty.  
    This patch will add a filter, to ignore those alerts, where ALLERGY
    TYPE field (#3.1) in PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8), does not contain 
    the Drug code of "D", as no action was needed to be taken for this
    scenario.

 Patch Installation:
 ===================
  
 Pre Installation Overview
 --------------------------
 NOTE: Patch installers should compare checksums prior to installing this 
 patch to identify any routines that may contain local modifications. The 
 modifications will have to be reintroduced following installation of this 
 patch.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch GMRA*4.0*58.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  Select the installation option Backup a Transport Global. This option
     will create a backup message of any routines exported with this patch
     in case you need to backout this patch. It will not backup any other
     changes such as Data Dictionaries (DD's) or templates. It is important
     this step be followed, because if backout of this patch is necessary,
     having the backup will make the process much easier.
  
 4.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch 
     GMRA*4.0*58:
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 5.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 6.  If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//,' respond No
  
 7.  If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//,' respond No

 Backout Procedures
 ------------------
  
 Backout Procedures are only needed if there are major problems (examples 
 include the KIDS notice of incompletion or hard errors) resulting from the
 installation of this patch. You must have concurrence from Health Product
 Support before a rollback can occur. Enter a ServiceNow ticket to obtain
 this concurrence.
  
 Prior to installing a patch, the site/region should have saved a backup 
 of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport Global 
 [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install). The message 
 containing the backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" 
 function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function 
 "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up routines 
 onto the VistA System.
   
   
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
  
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the PSS Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the 
 GMRA*4.0*58 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch GMRA*4.0*58 in 
 the [Patch List] section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;4.0;Adverse Reaction Tracking;**[Patch List]**;Mar 29, 1996;Build 5

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.

Routine Name: GMRAPEM0
    Before: B67572191   After: B68246596  **2,5,17,21,36,50,58**
