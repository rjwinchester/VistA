Subject: ASSESSMENT CLEAN UP UTILITY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 During review of the three defect tickets submitted regarding a hard 
 error in allergy order checking, it was discovered there was a data 
 integrity issue with some entries in the ADVERSE REACTION TRACKING (GMRA) 
 system.
  
 This patch will install the Assessment Clean Up Utility, allowing sites to
 identify and correct any discrepancies between the ADVERSE REACTION 
 ASSESSMENT file (#120.86) and the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8).

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 1. 827602 Adverse Reaction Tracking - Receiving Error (Undefined, 
           NullSubscript, etc):
    831129 Adverse Reaction Tracking - Allergy Order Checks:
    833419 Outpatient Pharmacy - Other:
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When a pharmacist processes a prescription, a <UNDEFINED>DSPLY+4^PSODGAL1 
 *GMRAL error is generated, preventing the pharmacist from finishing the 
 prescription.  This error is generated when the ADVERSE REACTION 
 ASSESSMENT file (#120.86) data is out of sync with the PATIENT ALLERGIES 
 file (#120.8) data, specifically, the patient had a value of NO for the 
 assessment yet had active reactions.  Outpatient Pharmacy patch PSO*7*390 
 enabled the pharmacy order checks to display sign and symptom data in the 
 text of a drug-allergy order check message.  To accomplish this, two 
 allergy APIs were called: one that performed the order check (which 
 ignored the assessment data) and another that retrieved the sign and 
 symptom data (which did not ignore the assessment data).  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This data issue was caused by version 2 of the Adverse Reaction Tracking 
 software package (the current version is 4).  The current version of the 
 software prevents this data problem from occurring.  Therefore, the 
 Assessment Clean Up Utility tool was created to enable sites to identify 
 patients in this situation and manually correct the appropriate data so 
 that both files are in agreement.
 **NOTE: Installation of this patch does not by itself prevent the 
 undefined error from occurring.  Sites must use the tool to correct any 
 problems that it identifies in order to prevent the error from occurring.

 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the documentation directly using Secure File Transfer
 Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following OI

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 During the post installation, the B cross-reference in the ADVERSE 
 REACTION ASSESSMENT file (#120.86) is re-indexed. After the install has
 completed, KIDS will automatically delete the post install routine once
 the install successfully completes.
  
 After installing this patch, sites must run the utility and correct all
 problems identified. Sites should not run the utility while patient 
 merges are in progress. Refer to the Track Status of Merge Process 
 section in the Duplicate Record Merge: Patient Merge User Manual to 
 determine if there are any patient merges in progress. If the utility's
 patient list contains patients without names, sites should submit a CA SDM
 ticket for support in deleting the list of patients and re-running the
 utility.
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system. Sites are 
 strongly encouraged to queue this patch to install outside of normal 
 business hours as the post installation may impact users entering 
 adverse reaction assessments. This patch should take less than 5 minutes
 to install. There are no options to disable for this installation.

 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 *****Important Note*****
 It is imperative that sites run the GMRA ASSESSMENT UTILITY to identify 
 any potential data issues and correct them as soon as possible in order to
 mitigate any potential patient safety issues from improper allergy order
 checks. Sites should ensure there are no patient merges in progress while
 the background task builds the list of patients with data issues. In order
 to coordinate, you will have to determine who performs patient merges for
 your facility. Sites have different departments involved in patient 
 merges. Some sites use a team of the MPI coordinator and OIT 
 representatives. Others use HIMs or potentially the business office.
  
 *****Important Note*****
 These discrepancies must be corrected before the installation of the 
 Medication Order Check Healthcare Application (MOCHA) Enhancements 2 
 (ME2) patches.
  
 The first time GMRA ASSESSMENT UTILITY is accessed, a search will process 
 through the ADVERSE REACTION ASSESSMENT file (#120.86) and the PATIENT 
 ALLERGIES file (#120.8) looking for any possible discrepancies.
  
 When the search is complete, a MailMan message with the subject GMRA 
 ASSESSMENT FIX LIST BUILD STATUS, will be sent to the person who started 
 the task as well as any additional recipients specified. 
  
 At this time, the patients and discrepancies need to be reviewed and
 corrected to mitigate any potential patient safety issues. Use the GMRA
 ASSESSMENT UTILITY to see the list of patients, if any, and the
 discrepancies found. For further instructions, as well as examples, please
 refer to the Adverse Reaction Tracking User Manual (GMRA_4_UM_R0416).
