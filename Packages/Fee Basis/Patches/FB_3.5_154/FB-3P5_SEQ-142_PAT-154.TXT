Description:
============

  ************************************************************************
  *  If your site is using the Fee Basis Claims System (FBCS), you must  * 
  *  install DSIF*3.2*38 immediately after installing FB*3.5*154 to      *
  *  avoid application/processing errors. If your site is not using      *
  *  FBCS, there is no need to install the FBCS patch.                   *
  ************************************************************************
  
  ************************************************************************
  *  Before installing patch FB*3.5*154 identify user accounts that must *
  *  be allocated new security keys per the post install step to         *
  *  minimize disruption of business processes.                          *

 This patch is dedicated to the memory of Mr. Les Niemiec, VHA National
 Fee Program Manager from 2005-2009. He always went the extra mile for
 Veterans, and was a major force in developing and managing the Fee
 programs that serve our Veterans and their families.
  
  
 Patch FB*3.5*154 is one of the Fee Basis patches for the VistA Fee
 Separation of Duties project. Patches FB*3.5*151, FB*3.5*165, and
 FB*3.5*172 are other Fee Basis patches generated by the project.
  
 Patch FB*3.5*154 revises the locks on existing functionality and menu
 options to enhance the separation of duty controls.  This patch also
 modifies the software to enforce separation of duty business rules.
  
 This patch resolves an existing problem with the identification of the
 associated authorization for outpatient payments and inpatient ancillary
 payments.
  
 This patch modifies the software to prevent an undefined error when a 
 prescription is deleted.
  
 This patch modifies the software to prevent an undefined error when 
 rejected payments are re-initiated. 
  
  
 Detailed descriptions of the enhancements follow:
  
 01. SECURITY KEYS
  
     This patch adds three new security keys, if they don't already exist, 
     and modifies the description of the existing FBAASUPERVISOR security
     key.  The new keys give sites more control of user's access to the
     package functions.  Additionally, this patch modifies the software to
     lock many functions with the FBAA LEVEL 2 key instead of the
     FBAASUPERVISOR key. This is expected to reduce the number of
     individuals who need to hold the FBAASUPERVISOR key.  Lead clerks and
     supervisors may be assigned more than one of these keys.  The four
     keys exported by the patch are listed below:
  
     Key: FBAA LEVEL 1 AUTH
     Permits the holder to enter and edit 7079 authorizations, 7078 
     authorizations, civil hospital notifications, nursing home movements,
     and unauthorized claims.
  
     Key: FBAA LEVEL 1 PMT
     Permits the holder to enter and edit invoices and payments.  
  
     Key: FBAA LEVEL 2
     Permits the holder to certify a batch for payment, queue data for 
     transmission to Central FEE, void payments, and update contract and
     rate data for nursing home vendors. The holder of this key can also
     bypass some user and status restrictions during selection of a payment
     or batch. This key is normally assigned to a lead clerk or supervisor.
  
     Key: FBAASUPERVISOR 
     Permits the holder to edit site parameters, maintain the VA fee
     schedule, edit the contract file, reprocess an overdue batch, resend a
     completed batch, re-transmit MRAs, and purge MRAs.  This key is
     normally assigned to a supervisor.
  
  
 02. REVISE LOCKS ON MENU OPTIONS
  
     Menu options can be locked by a security key.  A locked option can
     only be accessed by users who hold the applicable security key.  This
     patch modifies locks on the menu options.  Menu options used to modify
     authorizations are generally locked by the new FBAA LEVEL 1 AUTH
     security key.  Menu options used to process payments are generally
     locked by the new FBAA LEVEL 1 PMT security key.  Menu options
     normally restricted to a lead clerk or supervisor are locked by the
     new FBAA LEVEL 2 security key.  Menu options normally restricted to a
     supervisor are locked by the FBAASUPERVISOR security key.
  
     A list of menu options (sorted by menu) whose lock is modified by the 
     patch follows:
     The old lock column shows the lock in place (if any) prior to 
     installation of the patch.

 03. ATTACH MENU OPTIONS TO ADDITIONAL MENUS
  
     Several menu options that are attached to the Supervisor Main Menu
     are now also attached to additional menus so they can be utilized by
     users who should not have access to the supervisor menu.
  
     Delete reject flag
         Added to Batch Main Menu (under Medical Fee Main Menu)
         Added to Batch Menu - Pharmacy (under Pharmacy Fee Main Menu)
  
     Finalize a Batch

         Added to Batch Main Menu (under Medical Fee Main Menu)
         Added to Batch Menu - Pharmacy (under Pharmacy Fee Main Menu)
         Added to Batch Main Menu - CH (under Civil Hospital Main Menu)
  
  
 04. REVISE LOCKS DURING SELECTION OF PAYMENTS
  
     Many options used to enter or edit payments and payment batches
     prevent selection of a payment or batch that was entered by another
     user.  This restriction is not imposed on a user who holds the
     FBAASUPERVISOR security key.
  
     Many options used to enter or edit payments and payment batches
     prevent selection of a payment or batch when the batch has certain
     status values such as supervisor closed.  Fewer batch status values
     are restricted for a user who holds the FBAASUPERVISOR security key.
  
     The following menu options are modified by this patch to check for the
     new FBAA LEVEL 2 security key INSTEAD OF the existing FBAASUPERVISOR 
     security key when imposing restrictions on the selection of a payment
     or payment batch.
  
     Edit Batch data [FBAA BATCH EDIT]
     Close-out Batch [FBAA CLOSE BATCH]
     Re-open Batch [FBAA REOPEN BATCH]
     Batch Delete [FBAA BATCH DELETE]
     Enter Payment [FBAA ENTER PAYMENT]
     Multiple Payment Entry [FBAA MULTIPLE PAYMENT ENTRY]
     Reimbursement Payment Entry [FBAA MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT]
     Ancillary Contract Hosp/CNH Payment [FBCH ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
     Multiple Ancillary Payments [FBCH MULTIPLE PAYMENTS]
     Patient Reimbursement for Ancillary Services [FBCH ANCILLARY 
       REIMBURSEMENT]
     Payments for Unauthorized Claims [FBUC PAYMENTS]
     Delete Payment Entry [FBAA DELETE PAYMENT]
     Complete a Payment [FBCH COMPLETE PAYMENT]
     Re-initiate Pricer Rejected Items [FBCH REINITIATE PRICER REJECTS]
     Delete Inpatient Invoice [FBCH DELETE INVOICE]
     Invoice Edit [FBCH EDIT PAYMENT]
     Edit CNH Payment [FBCNH EDIT PAYMENT]
     Delete Inpatient Invoice [FBCH DELETE INVOICE]
     Edit Payment [FBAA EDIT PAYMENT]
     Edit Ancillary Payment [FBCH EDIT ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
     Edit Pharmacy Invoice [FBAA EDIT PHARMACY INVOICE]
  
  
 05. REVISE LOCKS DURING SELECTION OF CIVIL HOSPITAL NOTIFICATIONS
  
     The option Delete Notification/Request [FBCH DELETE REQUEST] currently
     restricts the selection of a notification/request to the USER ENTERING
     NOTIFICATION unless the FBAASUPERVISOR key is held.  This option is 
     modified by this patch to instead check if the user holds the FBAA
     LEVEL 2 security key.
  
  
 06. REMOVE LOCK ON ENTRY OF AN AMOUNT PAID THAT EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT CLAIMED
  
     Menu options used to enter or edit outpatient and ancillary inpatient
     payments do not allow the user to enter an amount paid that exceeds
     the amount claimed or exceeds the calculated fee schedule amount
     unless the user holds the FBAASUPERVISOR key. This patch modifies the
     software by removing the requirement that a user hold the
     FBAASUPERVISOR security key to enter an amount paid that exceeds the
     amount claimed or fee schedule amount.  The following options are
     modified:
  
     Enter Payment [FBAA ENTER PAYMENT]
     Multiple Payment Entry [FBAA MULTIPLE PAYMENT ENTRY]
     Reimbursement Payment Entry [FBAA MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT]
     Ancillary Contract Hosp/CNH Payment [FBCH ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
     Multiple Ancillary Payments [FBCH MULTIPLE PAYMENTS]
     Patient Reimbursement for Ancillary Services [FBCH ANCILLARY 
       REIMBURSEMENT]
     Payments for Unauthorized Claims [FBUC PAYMENTS]
     Edit Payment [FBAA EDIT PAYMENT]
     Edit Ancillary Payment [FBCH EDIT ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
  
  
 07. ADD LOCK TO THE UPDATE OF CNH CONTRACT OR RATE DATA
  
     This patch locks with the FBAA LEVEL 2 security key the ability to
     update contract and rate data for a community nursing home vendor.  
     The following options are modified to check if user holds the security
     key before allowing the contract and rate data to be updated:
  
     Vendor Enter/Edit [FBCNH VENDOR ENTER/EDIT]
     Display,Enter,Edit Demographics [FBAA VENDOR DEMOGRAPHICS]
  
  
 08. ADD LOCK TO AN INTERACTIVE FPPS TRANSMIT DATA
  
     The Transmit Invoices to FPPS [FB FPPS TRANSMIT] option is modified by
     this patch to require the user to hold the FBAA LEVEL 2 security key
     when the option is run interactively from the menu.  The patch does
     not make any changes to the option when it is run as a scheduled task
     (non-interactively).
  
  
 09. LIST OF PENDING 7078S MODIFIED TO CONSIDER DIFFERENT SECURITY KEY
  
     The following menu option only shows pending 7078s entered by the user
     unless the FBAASUPERVISOR key is held:  This option is changed to 
     check if the user holds the FBAA LEVEL 2 security key rather than the
     FBAASUPERVISOR security key.
  
     Civil Hospital Main Menu [FBCH MAIN MENU]
  
  
 10. CREATE USER ACCESS REPORT
  
     This patch creates a new option called Security Key Report for Fee
     Basis [FB SEC KEY RPT].  This option is attached to the Supervisor
     Main Menu [FBAA SUPERVISOR OPTIONS] and it is locked by the
     FBAASUPERVISOR security key.  The new option generates a report of
     users that hold Fee Basis security keys.  An example is shown below:
  
  Select Supervisor Main Menu <TEST ACCOUNT> Option: SECurity Key Report 
  for Fee Basis
  Should report include terminated users with keys? NO// 
  Sort by Security Key or User:  (S/U): SECURITY KEY
  Select Fee Basis Security Key: ALL// 
  DEVICE: HOME//
  
  Security Key Report for Fee Basis         OCT 17, 2014@11:01:28   page 1
    by Security Key for all FB keys

 11. DISABLE SITE PARAMETER EDIT AUTH. DURING PAYMENT
  
     The site parameter EDIT AUTH. DURING PAYMENT allows selected 
     authorization fields to be edited when some types of payments are 
     entered. This site parameter is disabled by this patch and will no
     longer be asked when the site parameters are edited or have any effect
     on the software behavior.
  
  
 12. PREVENT ENTRY OF PAYMENT OR PRICING IF USER ENTERED AUTHORIZATION
  
     This patch modifies the software to prevent a user from entering
     payment or pricing for a service if that user previously entered or
     edited the associated authorization for the service.  Entry or edit of
     a civil hospital notification, community nursing home contract rate
     for a patient, community nursing home movement, or unauthorized claim
     is considered as a change to the associated authorization.
  
     The options used to enter or edit 'authorizations' are modified to
     keep track of users.  The options used to process payments are
     modified to prevent the user who entered or edited the 'authorization'
     associated with the payment from proceeding.
  
  
 13. NURSING HOME DAILY RATE CANNOT BE ENTERED DURING PAYMENT
  
     This patch modifies the Enter CNH Payment [FBCNH ENTER PAYMENT] option
     to no longer allow entry of missing daily rates.  An update to the
     daily rate is considered an edit of the authorization and the person
     who processes the payment cannot edit the authorization per
     separation of duties.
  
  
 14. DISPLAY USERS THAT ENTERED OR EDITED RECORDS
  
     This patch modifies the Clerk Look-Up For An Authorization report and
     adds three new reports to display the list of users who entered or
     edited an authorization or associated records.  These options are
     locked by the FBAASUPERVISOR security key.
  
     Clerk Look-Up For An Authorization [FBAA CLERK LOOK-UP]
         This option will list users that entered or edited a specified 
         authorization in the FEE BASIS PATIENT file.  When applicable the
         output will also show users that entered or edited the civil
         hospital notification or unauthorized claims associated with the
         authorization.
  
     Clerk Lookup for 7078 Authorization [FBCH CLERK LOOKUP]
         This option will list users that entered or edited a specified
         7078 authorization.  Entry or edit of nursing home rate and
         movements are included in this output. When applicable the output
         will also show users that entered or edited the civil hospital
         notification associated with the authorization.
  
     Clerk Lookup for Notification/Request [FBCH REQUEST CLERK LOOKUP]
         This option will list users that entered or edited a specified 
         notification/request.
  
     Clerk Lookup for Unauthorized Claim [FBUC CLERK LOOKUP]
         This option will list users that entered or edited a specified 
         unauthorized claim.
  
  
 15. PAYMENT REFERENCE TO AUTHORIZATION ISSUE
  
     There can be a problem with the association of an outpatient or
     inpatient ancillary payment to the appropriate authorization.  The
     problem occurs when there are payments that should be associated with
     different authorizations, but those payments have the exact same
     patient, vendor, and date of service.  This situation is common with
     home health services where there are separate authorizations for
     nursing and non-nursing services for a single patient and those
     services are provided to the patient by the same vendor on the same
     date.  
  
     This problem can result in various errors including sending the wrong 
     purpose of visit code when a payment batch is sent to Central FEE.
  
     The problem was originally reported on Remedy Ticket 726099.
     A fix for this issue was requested by new service request 20120609.
  
     This patch modifies the software to prevent the problem from occurring
     for new payments.  Additionally, when the patch is installed a
     one-time job will examine existing payments and correct many or all of
     the existing inappropriate associations.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ----------------------------
 1. REMEDY Ticket 833468
  
    Problem: An undefined error occurs when a prescription is deleted from
    an existing pharmacy invoice using the Edit Pharmacy Invoice [Edit
    Pharmacy Invoice] option.
  
    Resolution: This patch modifies routine FBAAEPI to prevent the
    undefined error from occurring.
  
  
 2. REMEDY Ticket 985307
  
    Problem: The Re-initiate Rejected Payment Items [FBAA REINITIATE
    REJECTS] option contains a fault when it is used to re-initiate all
    items in an outpatient or ancillary inpatient (type B3) payment
    batch.  The problem does not occur when the line items are individually
    re-initiated.
  
    The software attempts to track all payment lines (sorted by invoice)
    that are re-initiated into the new batch.  If all the lines on an
    invoice are not moved into the new batch the re-initiated lines are
    assigned a different invoice number so an invoice is not spilt between
    two different payment batches.
  
    The problem is that the software does not determine the invoice number 
    when a line is re-initiated.  If the batch was previously displayed the
    invoice of the last displayed line item is inappropriately treated as
    the invoice of all the re-initiated line items.  If the batch was not
    displayed the option abends with an undefined error for variable FBIN.
  
    Resolution: The problem is corrected by modifying routine FBAARR1
    within line tag REJM so the invoice number of a line item is
    appropriately determined before it is referenced later in that section
    of code.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 Before installing the patch, the FBAA LEVEL 1 AUTH, FBAA LEVEL 1 PMT,
 and FBAA LEVEL 2 security keys must be allocated to appropriate users.
  
 The patch contains a post install routine that automatically populates
 new fields for existing records.
  
 The post install routine creates entries in the new USER AUDIT multiple of
 the following files based on existing data:
   FEE BASIS PATIENT (#161)
   FEE NOTIFICATION/REQUEST (#162.2)
   VA FORM 10-7078 (#162.4)
   FEE BASIS UNAUTHORIZED CLAIM (#162.7)
  
 The post install populates the new AUTHORIZATION POINTER field in the
 SERVICE PROVIDED multiple of the FEE BASIS PAYMENT (#162) file based on
 existing data.
  
 After the patch is installed the FBAASUPERVISOR security key must be
 de-allocated from user accounts that no longer require that key.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 Patch FB*3.5*172 previously exported the FBAA LEVEL 1 AUTH, FBAA LEVEL 1 
 PMT, and FBAA LEVEL 2 security keys. These keys must be allocated to
 appropriate users prior to the patch FB*3.5*154 installation to minimize
 work disruption.
  
 Patch FB*3.5*154 modifies the software to use these new security keys.
  
 The FBAASUPERVISOR security key must be de-allocated from user accounts 
 that no longer require that key once patch FB*3.5*154 is installed. Before
 installing the patch, sites may want to make a list of user accounts that
 no longer need the FBAASUPERVISOR security key once the patch is 
 installed.
  
 The following five globals may increase in size during the install of the
 patch. Global size increases at four test sites varied greatly, The
 difference is believed to be due to the storage efficiency of the global.
 Globals that have been compressed are expected to experience a higher
 increase in size when the patch is installed.
  
   Global   Minimum %   Maximum %   Average %
             Increase    Increase    Increase
   ------   ---------   ---------   ---------
   FB583         0          40.00      17.50
   FB7078        0          20.81       9.16
   FBAA          0          13.83       5.84

   FBAAC         0.01        6.78       3.76
  
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the 
 following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their 
 descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts during the 
 install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
   Fee Basis Main Menu [FBAA MAIN MENU]
    
 This patch should take from 30 to 90 minutes to install at most
 sites.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter 
     FB*3.5*154.
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//' answer NO unless your system does not do this in a
     nightly TaskMan process.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//' answer NO.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//' answer YES. 
  
     When prompted 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of
     Order':'  Enter the following options:
        Fee Basis Main Menu [FBAA MAIN MENU]
  
     When prompted 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of
     Order':' press <return>.
  
 8.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 9.  DELETE INSTALL ROUTINE FROM SYSTEM
     -----------------------------------
     (Optional) Delete the FBXIP154 install routine.
  
     Routine FBXIP154 contains the post install code for the patch. The
     post install populates the new USER AUDIT multiple in Files 161,
     162.2, 162.4, and 162.7 based on existing data.  The post install also
     populates the new AUTHORIZATION POINTER field under the SERVICE 
     PROVIDED multiple in File 162 based on existing data. The post install
     writes information to the XTMP global concerning the population of the
     AUTHORIZATION POINTER field. The information in XTMP is retained for
     120 days after the install.
  
     When the post install creates user audit entries there may be errors
     reported that begin "Error creating record with IENS" followed by a
     set of numbers separated by commas.  For example:
           Error creating record with IENS +1,6,101374,
     This occurred at most of the test sites.  In all reviewed cases the
     problem was due to incomplete data in the pre-existing records such
     as missing .01 field values.  The incomplete records prevented
     filing of the new user audit data.  If the number of such errors is
     relatively small then no further action needs to be taken by the 
     installing site.  The post install updates some records as old as
     20+ years and some incomplete records in the database are expected.
  
     After the patch has been installed routine FBXIP154 can optionally be
     deleted. However, sites may want to retain the routine until the XTMP
     global is purged since it contains a label that can be called from 
     programmer mode to display relevant information from the XTMP global.
  
 10. DE-ALLOCATE SECURITY KEY FBAASUPERVISOR FROM APPROPRIATE USERS
     --------------------------------------------------------------
     De-allocate the FBAASUPERVISOR security key from user accounts that no
     longer require that key.
