Subject: SUPPORT FOR MASTER VETERAN INDEX DATE OF DEATH ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) enhancements are being distributed in
       four VistA namespaces: DG, MPIF, RG and FB.
       The only build enforced requirements are that:
         - FB*3.5*173 and DG*5.3*926 be installed prior to MPIF*1.0*64 
         - DG*5.3*926 be installed prior to RG*1.0*65
       Therefore non-legacy sites can install FB*3.5*173 and DG*5.3*926
       in any order, then install MPIF*1.0*64 and RG*1.0*65 patches in any
       order (Do NOT install MPIF*1.0*64 or RG*1.0*65 on legacy sites). 
  
 NOTE: Legacy sites can install just the DG*5.3*926 and FB*3.5*173 patches.
       MPIF*1.0*64 and RG*1.0*65 should NOT be installed on legacy sites.
  
 Enhancements
 This enhancement patch provides additional support to allow the Master
 Veteran Index (MVI) to support the Date of Death of patients at the
 Medical Facilities.
  
 Routine FBUTLMVI was created to provide the MASTER PATIENT INDEX VISTA 
 (MPIF) package with an Application Program Interface (API) to search for
 FEE BASIS related activity in the FEE BASIS PAYMENT (#162), FEE BASIS 
 PHARMACY INVOICE (#162.1) and the FEE BASIS UNAUTHORIZED CLAIMS (#162.7)
 files for a specific patient after a specified date. This API will return
 a count of the number of occurrences of activity that occurred for the
 patient from the given date, as well as an array of the specific 
 activities that occurred. The MPIF software will use this information and
 information from other packages to confirm the validity of the reported
 Date of Death for the patient if no activity is found.
