Description:
============

  
  ************************************************************************
  *  If your site is using the Fee Basis Claims System (FBCS), you must  * 
  *  install DSIF*3.2*13 immediately after installing FB*3.5*158 to      *
  *  avoid application/processing errors. If your site is not using      *
  *  FBCS, there is no need to install the FBCS patch.                   *
  ************************************************************************
  
 The ERA Compliance patch (FB*3.5*158) addresses enhancements to VistA
 Fee Basis and its compliance to CORE Level III Electronic Funds Transfer
 (EFT) standards, as part of the Health Product Enhancements (HAPE)
 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Purchased Care (PC) software
 enhancement project.
  
 Batch Numbers will increase in size from 5 digits to 7 digits.
  
 Batches that are 7 years old or older will be purged on a monthly basis.
  
 Batch files, transmitted to Central Fee, for inpatient, outpatient, and
 pharmacy claims will be updated to include data elements, previously
 transmitted via Vitria, as well as additional claim data.
  
 Allow a maximum of 5 CARCs per claim line item with a maximum of 2 RARCs
 per CARC to be entered.
  
 Software was also modified to decrease the maximum number of lines in a 
 batch due to the addition of new fields in the batch.
  
 -OUTPATIENT: Previously users were able to have 85 lines in a batch; 
 this is now changed to a maximum of 50 lines per batch.   
  
 -INPATIENT:  Previously users were able to have 42 lines in a batch; 
 this is now changed to a maximum of 30 lines per batch.
  
 -PHARMACY:  Line maximum is unchanged by this patch.
  
 Associate CARCs with CORE Business Scenarios so that once a CARC and
 scenario is established, only additional CARCs from the same scenario
 can be selected.
  
 Set up the Fee Basis data dictionary to support RARC to CARC
 relationships, still allowing for the selection of CARCless RARCs. Also
 support relationships between CARCs and Groups, and RARCs and Groups.
  
 Populates ADJUSTMENT REASON (CARC) file (#161.91) with associated
 REMITTANCE REMARK (RARC) codes, CORE SENARIO, and ADJUSTMENT GROUPs
 (CAGC) to be complaint with CORE-required Code Combinations for CORE-
 defined Business Scenarios for the Phase III CORE 360 Uniform Use of
 Claim Adjustment Reason Codes and Remittance Advice Remark Codes (835)
 Rule version 3.3.0 June 2016.
  
 The Fee Basis data dictionary will be expanded to accept additional
 payment methodologies from FBCS.
