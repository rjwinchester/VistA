Description:
============

 **IMPORTANT INFORMATION** Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_Prod_Overview_Guide_Group_8B.pdf) posted on the Anonymous
 directory for installation order. This is critical for proper 
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software. NOTE: FB*3.5*143 must be
 installed before FB*3.5*139 as stated in the Overview Guide.
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the implementation date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
 systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
 which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set.
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research.
  
  
 The intent of this patch is to:
  
 Add new routines to handle ICD-10 Advanced Search Functionality (ASF): 
 FBASF to call the ICD-10 Lexicon diagnosis search utility (API) to prompt 
 user for ICD-10 diagnosis code entry on or after the ICD-10 implementation
 date. FBASFL to provide listing of ICD-10 diagnosis codes for user
 selection, based on user search entry.  FBASFU to provide utilities used
 within the ICD-10 Advanced Search Functionality (ASF).
  
 Add functionality to utilize the Lexicon diagnosis search utility when a 
 user is entering an ICD-10 diagnosis code into input templates (FBAA 
 AUTHORIZATION, FBCH ENTER PAYMENT, FBCH EDIT PAYMENT, FB UNAUTHORIZED 
 ENTER, FB UNAUTHORIZED EDIT) and routines (FBAACO2, FBAACO3, FBAAPET,
 FBAACP, FBAAMP1).
  
 Update code set versioning utility routine, FBCSV1, to be compatible with 
 ICD-10.
  
 Add the ICD DIAGNOSIS field (#.087), a pointer field to the ICD DIAGNOSIS
 file (#80), to the AUTHORIZATION multiple field (#161.1) of the FEE BASIS
 PATIENT file (#161) for ICD-10. The free text fields (DX LINE 1 field
 (#.08), DX LINE 2 field (#.085), DX LINE3 field (#.086)) will continue to
 be used for ICD-9.
  
 Add the ICD DIAGNOSIS field (#5.1), a pointer field to the ICD DIAGNOSIS
 file (#80), to the FEE BASIS UNAUTHORIZED CLAIMS file (#162.7)
 for ICD-10. The free text field DIAGNOSIS field (#5) will continue to be
 used for ICD-9.
  
 The code was modified to handle fields ICD1-ICD5 (#30-#34), fields 
 PROC1-PROC5 (#40-#44) of the FEE BASIS INVOICE file (#162.5).
  
 The code was modified to handle new fields added by patch FB*3.5*108, 
 fields ICD6-ICD25 (#35-#36.9), fields POA1-POA25 
 (#30.02-#36.92), fields PROC6-PROC25 (#40.06-#44.25),field
 ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS (#39) of the FEE BASIS INVOICE file (#162.5).
  
 Modify the payment user input process to provide the user with the ICD-10 
 Advanced Search Functionality (ASF) for payments with ICD-10 diagnosis. 
 As well as adjustments to the basic ICD-9 diagnosis search to handle the 
 new file structure for the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80). Also modified the 
 payment user input process for basic ICD-9 and ICD-10 procedure code 
 searches to support the new file structure for the ICD 
 OPERATION/PROCEDURE file (#80.1). (Enter Invoice/Payment [FBCH
 ENTER PAYMENT], Invoice Edit [FBCH EDIT PAYMENT])
  
 Modify code for Pricer Interface Transmissions to handle the new ICD-10
 format.
  
 Modify code for Central Fee Transmissions to Austin to handle the new
 ICD-10 format.
