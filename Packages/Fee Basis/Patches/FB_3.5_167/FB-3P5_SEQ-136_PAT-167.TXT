 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. I6381862FY16 - ICD-10 issues in Vista VISN 2
   
    Problem:
    --------
    The Enter Unauthorized Claim [FBUC ENTER] option is failing when 
    trying to store data in the ICD DIAGNOSIS (#.087) field in the
    AUTHORIZATION (#161.01) sub-file of the FEE BASIS PATIENT (#161) file.
    The user sees a "??" when that data is trying to file, and they are not
    prompted for the "Accident Related" or "Potential Cost Recovery"
    questions.  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Input Template FB UNAUTHORIZED UPDATE was modified to //// stuff the
    value of the pointer to the ICD DIAGNOSIS (#80) file in the ICD
    DIAGNOSIS (#.087) field. A post-install routine will also provide
    a list of entries where data is missing from the FEE BASIS PATIENT
    (#161) file.
