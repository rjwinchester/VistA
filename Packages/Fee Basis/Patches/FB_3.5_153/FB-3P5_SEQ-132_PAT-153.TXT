 1. Patient MRA rejections from FMS.
  
 2. For option 'Enter Unauthorized Claim' the response to query Mill Bill

    are hitting every station's obligations for integrated sites when
    posted.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. INC000000881344 Patient MRA rejections on transmission to FMS
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site received FMS returned message errors for Patient MRA sent with null 
 or undefined state that would also shift subsequent data stream.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify processing routine to set State code to either state code 
 abbreviation when defined or to two spaces if null or undefined.
  
 Routines: FBAAV4
  
  
  
 2. INC000000799322 The Mill Bill Claim indicator is not always stored 
                    properly in VistA. 
                 
 Problem:
 --------
 When user enters initial (N)o response to query 'Is this claim being
 considered under Millennium Act 38 U.S.C. 1725' the response will be
 stored as null (instead of 0) and a later display of the Unauthorized 
 Claim will not display the field at all.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to routine FBUCEN and input template 'FB 
 UNAUTHORIZED ENTER' to ensure a response of (N)o will be stored as 0 and 
 subsequent displays of the Unauthorized Claim will always display the 
 field '38 U.S.C. 1725' with a value of (Y)es or (N)o.
  
 Routines: FBUCEN      Input Template: FB UNAUTHORIZED ENTER
  
  
  
 3. IN0000000990062 Duplicate 1358 entries across multiple stations when
                    posting CNH commitments for Obligation
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When user attempts (when multiple stations defined at site) to Post 
 Commitments for Obligation each station's authorization will appear on 
 all the other defined stations that are also posting their commitments.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to routines that when Estimating or posting 
 station commitments for obligation they only show for the station they 
 are associated with.
  
 Routines: FBNHPC, FBNHPC1
  
  
  
 4. INC000001219665 Veteran MRAs are not processing to Central Fee
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site received 037 rejection message from Central Fee for missing Patient 
 MRA transmissions. Transmissions not sent if a patient MRA entry has a 
 missing patient authorization pointer OR the patient authorization 
 has been deleted, if a batch contains less than 100 patient MRA 
 transmissions.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Patient MRA transmission processing logic was modified in 
 retransmit/transmit routine to check for a Patient MRA with missing
 pointer or patient authorization deleted and will delete that entry and
 continue processing valid entries and ensure a full transmission is
 completed.

       After this patch is installed, action may need to be taken related
       to Issue 4:
  
       After the patch is installed, users should work their rejects and
       update MRA's as need. They should resubmit any reimbursables. It is
       not recommended to use the Re-Transmit MRA's [FBAA REQUEUE MRA]
       option for records of more than a day or two in the past because we
       do not want to overwrite new data with older data, and the option
       re-transmits all types of MRA's, not just Veteran MRA's.
