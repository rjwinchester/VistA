Subject: FIX ISSUES WITH RATES, VETERAN & ANCILLARY PAYMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch addresses four issues:
 1. Modifies logic when applying the "Mill-Bill" claims 70% reduction when
    local fee schedule (75th percentile) rates are used.
  
 2. Changes the fee program for ancillary payments entered using Multiple
    Ancillary Payments [FBCH MULTIPLE PAYMENTS] option from "Outpatient" to
    "Civil Hospital".
  
 3. Modifies the sort and print routines for Veteran Payment History report
    to display the '#' symbol for voided payments.
  
 4. Modifies the Fee Basis payment system to allow users holding the   
    "FBAASUPERVISOR" key to exceed the amount of billed charges.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1. INC000000271207 - Programming logic issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    If during payment of a claim that has been marked as "Mill-Bill", the
    CPT code defaults to the Local Fee (75th Percentile) rate, Fee Basis is 
    calculating 70% of that amount, which does not follow current regulation.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch checks for the type of Fee Schedule used in calculating an
    amount, and if the Local Fee (75th Percentile) Schedule was used, then VistA
    will not apply the 70% reduction. 
  
 2. INC000000249588 - Payment information discrepancies  
   
    Problem:
    --------
    Using the Multiple Ancillary Payments [FBCH MULTIPLE PAYMENTS] option,
    payments entered under "Civil Hospital" have their "Fee Program" value
    set to "Outpatient", so when viewing the veterans "Payment History",
    they display incorrectly as "Outpatient".
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modifying routine FBAAMP to pass in the variable FBTYPE into the field
    "Fee Program" instead of the value "2", results in the correct Fee
    Program being assigned to the payment.
  
 3. INC000000483409 - Modify payments to allow user to exceed claim amount
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The VA has adopted the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
    reimbursement methodology for payment to non-VA providers. This change
    requires the VA to adopt Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS)
    payment methodology, which might require the VA to pay line items above
    their billed charges.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine FBAAMP and the input transform for AMOUNT PAID
    sub-field (#2) within the SERVICE PROVIDED multiple (#2) in the FEE
    BASIS PAYMENT (#162) file to allow users holding the "FBAASUPERVISOR"
    key to enter amounts exceeding charges claimed.
   
 4. INC000000333711 - Voided payment not indicated in Veterans Payment
                      History Option
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Voided ancillary civil hospital payments do not display the correct
    identifier (#), in Payment History Display [FBAA Payment History], 
    Vendor Payment Output [FB PAY VENDOR], or Veteran Payment Output [FB
    PAY VETERAN] displays.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Adding the variable "FBVP" to the ^TMP array that is set in routine
    FBPAY67, and then looking for that variable in routine FBPAY21 to write
    the identifier (#).
