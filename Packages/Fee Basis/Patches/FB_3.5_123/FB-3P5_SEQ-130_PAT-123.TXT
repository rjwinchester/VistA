Description:
============

 The Intra-governmental Payment and Collection System (IPAC) patch
 (FB*3.5*123) provides a standardized inter-agency funds transfer
 mechanism for Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  It facilitates
 the intra-governmental transfer of funds, with descriptive data, from
 the VHA to another federal agency.  Processing payments through IPAC
 provides the Financial Management Service (FMS) with the ability to
 meet its statutory requirements for accounting and reporting.
    
 The new system functions will provide a streamlined method to send
 Department of Defense (DoD) claims to IPAC leveraging current Veterans
 Integrated Systems Technology Architecture (VistA) Fee Basis
 application capabilities and data processes, and to provide the
 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with the ability to electronically
 process transmitted payments to any federal health care provider
 who is contracted to the VA.
  
 Some of the information needed to process a claim through IPAC is easier
 to collect at local facilities and document in VistA Fee Basis.
 Other information is more easily obtained nationally by Central Fee.
 Federal Accounting Service Payment and Collection (FASPAC) (the web-based
 application used for processing documents to IPAC) does not currently
 have the ability to receive data electronically from Central Fee.  VistA
 Fee Basis, Central Fee and FASPAC will all be involved in processing a
 claim through IPAC.
  
 This patch brings the VA into compliance with the Department of Treasury
 and Veterans Health Administration (VHA) guidelines to use IPAC to make
 payments between Federal agencies.  As sharing agreements expands between
 DoD and VHA facilities, the modifications made to VistA Fee Basis will
 allow for the additions of additional agreements seamlessly.
  
 This patch adds two files (Fee Basis IPAC Agreement, #161.95 and IPAC
 Agreement MRA, #161.96) to the Fee Basis application.  The IPAC Agreement
 file will maintain the IPAC Agreements made between a VHA facility and a
 DoD facility.  The IPAC Agreement number and the DoD Invoice number will
 both be recorded on Fee Basis invoices that are associated with an IPAC
 Agreement.
  
 The input of the Fee Basis outpatient/Ancillary Services invoices,
 inpatient invoices and pharmacy invoices will be modified to collect the IPAC 
 Agreement ID and DoD invoice number, if present on the invoice.  The DoD 
 invoice number will be found in box 3a of the UB04 and block 26 of the
 CMS1500 forms, depending on which is being input into the VistA Fee Basis
 application.  Any user with the proper security key (FB IPAC VENDOR) will
 be able to enter an IPAC agreement, change an IPAC agreement and, if
 allowable, delete an IPAC agreement.  Editing and deleting an IPAC
 agreement will only be allowed if there is not invoice activity associated
 with the IPAC agreement.
