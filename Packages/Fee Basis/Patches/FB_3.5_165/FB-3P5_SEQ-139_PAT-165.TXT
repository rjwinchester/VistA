Subject: FIX STATUS OF OLD PAYMENTS AND ENHANCE REJECT REPORT

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch deletes inappropriate reject flags from old payments.  This 
 patch removes old payments with payment confirmation or cancellation data
 from in-process batches. This patch enhances the Print Rejected Payment 
 Items report.
  
 Background:
  
 Currently, old payment entries which are flagged as rejected even though
 they have instead been paid or had their payments cancelled, cause
 problems keeping track of actual rejected payments. Users are unable to
 clean-up these old records through Fee Basis options and in some cases the
 obligations are no longer available for posting. This causes the Print
 Rejected Payment Items report to be useless at many sites because it
 lists all rejected payments and there are many pages of very old rejected
 payments.  In addition, sites may have re-initiated some of the actually
 paid payment lines into new batches for resubmission to Central Fee for
 payment.
  
 Discrepancies with old rejects make it harder for sites to keep track of 
 payments that need to be reprocessed.  This could result in providers not 
 being paid in a timely manner and thus in providers refusing to treat
 veterans where the VA is the payer.
  
 Detailed descriptions of the enhancements follow: 
  
 1. Delete Inappropriate Reject Flags
  
    When this patch is installed, a post install routine will delete the
    inappropriate reject flag from old payments with payment confirmation 
    or cancellation data.
  
    Payment line items in the following files or sub-files are examined:
  
      SERVICE PROVIDED sub-file of the FEE BASIS PAYMENT (#162) file.
        These are outpatient and inpatient ancillary payments. 
  
      TRAVEL PAYMENT DATE sub-file of the FEE BASIS PAYMENT (#162) file.
        These are veteran reimbursements for travel. 
  
      PRESCRIPTION NUMBER sub-file of the FEE BASIS PHARMACY INVOICE
        (#162.1) file.
        These are prescription payments.
  
      FEE BASIS INVOICE (#162.5) file.
        These are inpatient payments for civil hospital and community 
        nursing home invoices.
  
    The reject flag is deleted from payments that have payment confirmation
    or payment cancellation data if the current batch status is vouchered
    and at least one of the following three dates is prior to the
    compliance date of patch FB*3.5*132 which is March 7, 2013.
      o DATE FINALIZED for the batch
      o DATE PAID for the payment line
      o CANCELLATION DATE for the payment line
  
    Since these are older payments the post install does not attempt 
    to update the IFCAP 1358 obligation when a reject flag is deleted from
    a payment line.
  
    Sites that have purged batches may find that many of the inappropriate 
    reject flags are not deleted because the batch status is not
    vouchered.  No further action needs to be taken in this case because
    the payments are not listed on the Print Rejected Payment Items report
    and they cannot be re-initiated into a new batch.
  
  
 2. Remove Confirmed/Cancelled Payments from batches that have not yet
    been transmitted
  
    When this patch is installed, a post install routine will remove old
    payments with payment confirmation or cancellation data from payment
    batches that have not yet been transmitted.
  
    The payment data is retained and still available on reports.  However 
    the payment is no longer associated with a batch in a similar manner as
    payments whose batch has been purged.
  
    All four payment batch types are processed.  Batches with a current
    status of TRANSMITTED, CENTRAL FEE ACCEPTED, or VOUCHERED are 
    skipped.  Only payments that have a DATE PAID or CANCELLATION DATE that
    is prior to March 7, 2013 are removed from a batch.  For the 
    outpatient and ancillary payment batches, payment lines with DATE PAID
    prior to January 7, 2011 are only removed if a check number is also
    stored as additional confirmation of the payment.
  
  
 3. Enhance the Print Rejected Payment Items report
  
    This patch enhances the Print Rejected Payment Items report to exclude
    payments transmitted prior to a user-specified date. The report line
    which prints the batch number, the voucher date and the voucherer is
    also modified to accommodate a 7-digit batch number.

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
  
 8.  (Optional) After the installation, to verify that the conversion
     executed correctly, one can invoke a report which will display
     traits of payment lines that were removed from in-process batches.
     The batch's ID and status are also displayed.  As the report only
     has temporary interest, it is not attached to an option of a menu,
     but rather would be invoked directly at the MUMPS command line 
     prompt>.

 Hit <RETURN> to continue, '^' to Exit
  
     One can then look at each batch post-conversion using existing Fee
     Basis options List Items in Batch [FBAA LIST BATCH] and Status of
     Batch [FBAA BATCH STATUS] in order to see what payment lines remain
     in the batch and to confirm that the Payment Line Count, Invoice 
     Count, and Total Dollars have been recalculated correctly during the
     conversion.
  
     If no payment lines were removed from batches during conversion, the
     following message will be displayed:
     "There are no payment entries removed from batches."
  
     The value of this report will decrease over time as additional
     activity occurs for a given batch.  As the report runs off of a
     temporary ^XTMP global built during conversion, the report will not
     produce any output once the global reaches its deletion date 180 days
     after patch installation.  At that time the following message will be
     displayed:
     "There are no entries in the compile file for the FB*3.5*165 
     conversion.  The file must have been purged."
  
  
 9. DELETE INSTALL ROUTINES FROM SYSTEM
    -----------------------------------
     (Optional) Delete the FBXIP165, FBXI165A, and FBXI165C install
     routines.
  
     Routines FBXIP165 and FBXI165A contain the post install code for the
     patch. Routine FBXIP165 contains the code to delete an inappropriate 
     reject flag from old payments. Routine FBXI165A contains the code to
     remove confirmed payments from an in-process batch.
  
     Routine FBXI165C can be deleted once the REPORT OF PAYMENTS REMOVED
     FROM BATCHES (described in #8) is no longer needed.

Routine Information:
====================

 Description of Changes:
  Based on the ^XTMP file entry created during the post-install conversion, 
  this routine reports characteristics of payment lines removed from 
  pre-transmitted batches and batch number, batch status and batch type of 
  the batches from which they were removed.  This routine would be executed 
  from the programmer prompt to help validate the conversion.

Routine Name: FBXIP165
    Before:       n/a   After: B77466514  **165**
 Description of Changes:
  This is the main post-init routine. During patch installation it performs 
  a one-time (Delete Reject Flag) task that deletes the inappropriate reject
