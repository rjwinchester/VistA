 1. INC000000484024 - Addition of Remittance Remark Codes 
                      and Summary Descriptions
    I9872737FY16(d)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The REMITTANCE REMARK (#161.93) file needs to be updated.  Per the
    Chief Business Office Purchased Care (CBOPC), the missing remittance
    remark codes need to be added, and marked active and applicable for fee
    use.  
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    The REMITTANCE REMARK (#161.93) file will be brought into compliance
    by adding and updating the file with all of the codes on the list 
    published at the Washington Publishing Company (WPC).  
  
    Note: The information we have from this web site is as of March, 2016. 
    The list of codes can be found at: 
    http://www.wpc-edi.com/reference/codelists/healthcare/remittance-advice-
    remark-codes/
  
    All of the codes published by the WPC are relevant to the Fee Basis
    package. There are some codes that are currently active in the Fee
    Package that are to be inactivated.
  
    A list of the codes being inactivated can be found at:

    I9872996FY16(d)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The ADJUSTMENT REASON (#161.91) file needs to be updated.  Per the
    CBOPC, additional codes will be added, and several codes will
    need to be marked for fee use.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    The ADJUSTMENT REASON (#161.91) file will be updated with the request 
    from the CBOPC.    
  
    Note: The information we have from this web site is as of March, 2016.
