 CA TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ===================
 1. I9260083FY16 - Replacing Remedy ticket 1252723 -<SYNTAX> EN+12^FBAADEM1
   
    Problem:
    --------
    An issue arises when using a custom menu option which contains either
    the Re-open Unauthorized Claim [FBUC REOPEN] option or the Modify
    Unauthorized Claim [FBUC MODIFY UNAUTHORIZED CLAIM] option, and also
    the Fee Patient Inquiry [FBAA PATIENT INQUIRY] option. If either of the
    first two options are used and then the Fee Patient Inquiry [FBAA
    PATIENT INQUIRY] option is used then a syntax error occurs.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine FBUCED was modified to add the variable FBPROG to the
    End tagline which will clean up the FBPROG variable upon exiting
    the Re-open Unauthorized Claim [FBUC REOPEN] and Modify
    Unauthorized Claim [FBUC MODIFY UNAUTHORIZED CLAIM] options.
