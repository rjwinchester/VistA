    Problem:
    --------
    The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires six new Fee Basis
    Purpose of Visit (POV) codes added to the VistA database.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine FBXIP177 adds the six POV codes in the FEE BASIS PURPOSE OF
    VISIT (#161.82) file, as indicated.
  
    New Purpose of Visit Codes being added:

        OUTPATIENT
 93         OUTPATIENT IVF / ART CARE - SC VETERAN
        OUTPATIENT
 94         OUTPATIENT IVF / ART CARE - VETERAN COLLATERAL SPOUSE; FOR
            WHEN SPOUSE IS ALSO A VETERAN BUT NOT SC

            SPOUSE IS ALSO A VETERAN BUT NOT SC
         CIVIL HOSPITAL
  
  
 FBCS Note: 
  Once the POV codes are present in VistA, the sites simply need to re-sync
  the lookup tables for FBCS:
     In order to resynch the data, a user with administrator privileges in 
     FBCS Authorization will need to log in. From there, clicking the large
     arrow, and then Options, will bring you to the Options tabs. On the
     first options page there is a command to resynch lookup tables. It is
     recommended that the command is run toward the end of the workday.
  
  This step will load the outpatient codes 92-94. 
  There will be an FBCS update patch in the future that will allow for the 
  inpatient code use (codes 95-97) from the GUI application.
