Subject: CORRECT BLANK MRA AND BATCH WARNING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following:
  
 1) When a site hits 100 batches remaining they receive a warning message. This 
    warning message occurs too late for sites.
  
 2) The warning message displayed when a site hits 99,900 batches is not
    providing the correct amount of batches left.
  
 3) Sites are transmitting Veteran Master Record Adjustment's (MRAs) that 
    contain no information to Central Fee.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1) INC000000461268 - FEE BASIS BATCH LIMITATION
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a site hits 99,900 batches they receive a warning message that there are
 batches left before a purge must be run. This warning message occurs too
 late for sites.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The warning will now trigger when there are 500 batches remaining.
  
 Routine: FBAAUTL
  
 2) INC000000586418 - 71,000 batches left
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the warning message for low batches remaining displays, it is calculating
 the incorrect amount of batches remaining.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 By correcting the values being calculated, the system will display an
 accurate number of batches remaining.
  
 Routine: FBAAUTL
  
 3) INC000000516396 - Blank Veteran MRA records
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Central Fee is receiving "blank" Veteran MRA records from multiple sites.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 By correcting how Veteran MRAs are sent, we can prevent "blank" records
 from being transmitted.  Also, post install routine FBXIP127 will delete
 MRA entries that point to non-existent authorizations.
