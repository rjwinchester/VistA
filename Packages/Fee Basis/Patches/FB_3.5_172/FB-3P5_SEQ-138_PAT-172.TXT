Subject: SECURITY KEYS FOR SEPARATION OF DUTIES

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Other

Description:
============

 Patch FB*3.5*172 is a Fee Basis patch for the VistA Fee Separation
 of Duties project.
  
 Patch FB*3.5*172 creates three new security keys which will be referenced
 in software exported by subsequent patch FB*3.5*154. Once patch
 FB*3.5*172 is installed sites can allocate the new security keys to
 appropriate users prior to installation of patch FB*3.5*154 to lessen the
 risk of downtime when FB*3.5*154 is installed and the new keys are
 required to access software functions.
  
 Detailed descriptions of the enhancements follow:
  
 01. SECURITY KEYS
  
     This patch adds three new security keys.  The new keys will give
     sites more control of user's access to the package functions once
     patch FB*3.5*154 is installed. Additionally, once patch FB*3.5*154
     is installed many functions currently locked by the FBAASUPERVISOR
     key will instead be locked by the FBAA LEVEL 2 key. Users may be
     assigned more than one of these keys.  The keys exported by patch
     FB*3.5*172 are listed below:
  
     Key: FBAA LEVEL 1 AUTH
     Permits the holder to enter and edit 7079 authorizations, 7078 
     authorizations, civil hospital notifications, nursing home movements,
     and unauthorized claims.
  
     Key: FBAA LEVEL 1 PMT
     Permits the holder to enter and edit invoices and payments.  
  
     Key: FBAA LEVEL 2
     Permits the holder to certify a batch for payment, queue data for 
     transmission to Central FEE, void payments, and update contract and
     rate data for nursing home vendors. The holder of this key can also
     bypass some user and status restrictions during selection of a payment
     or batch. This key is normally assigned to a lead clerk or supervisor.
