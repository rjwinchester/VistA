 IMPORTANT INSTALLATION NOTE:
 ----------------------------
 There are three patches associated with this project - PRCA*4.5*310,
 IB*2.0*554 and FB*3.5*163. All three patches are to be installed as packman 
 files.  There is no bundle.  
  
 The three patches incorporated code from the following concurrent development 
 and, as such, the following patches MUST be installed prior to this project:
 1.)  IB*2.0*528
 2.)  IB*2.0*530 (and associated patches PRCA*4.5*303 - BUNDLED, IB*2.0*529
      and PRCA*4.5*304 - STANDALONE)
 3.)  FB*3.5*154 (and associated patches FB*3.5*172 and DSIF*3.2*38)
 4.)  FB*3.5*166
  
 The three patches for this project MUST be installed in this order:
 1.)  PRCA*4.5*310
 2.)  IB*2.0*554
 3.)  FB*3.5*163
  
 Description
 -----------
 The Chief Business Office (CBO) is requesting system enhancements to
 the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) Integrated Billing (IB), Accounts Receivable (AR), and Fee
 Basis (FB) software modules that would allow segregating all billing
 and Collection activities for Non-Department of Veterans Affairs (Non-VA)
 Care Third Party Insurance carriers' reimbursement.
  
 Current Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) Third Party billing and
 collections applications in the VistA information system do not
 segregate the Non-VA care claims from those claims for service rendered
 at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) healthcare facilities. This
 makes it difficult to determine whether all monies due VA for Non-VA
 care services are being billed and collected from Third Party
 insurance carriers, where applicable.  The current process is a resource
 intensive, manual process with no assurance that all applicable
 Non-VA Care charges have been billed and collected.
  
 This patch is being released as a group consisting of PRCA*4.5*310,
 IB*2.0*554, and FB*3.5*163. All of these patches must be installed
 together.
  
 This project will improve and automate the transfer of data from VistA
 Fee Basis to Integrated Billing. It will record Non-VA revenue in a
 different fund to allow separate tracking of these revenues. The patch
 makes the following changes and enhancements:
  
 Enhancements to the Potential Cost Recovery Report removed Service 
 Connected decision and added additional display fields.
  
 Added CHOICE program fields to the Fee Basis Contract File.
  
  
 Concurrent Development / Dependencies:
 --------------------------------------
 Patch FB*3.5*163 is dependent upon enhancements in FB*3.5*154 (Separation of
 Duties).  FB*3.5*154 is dependent upon DSIF*3.2*38 (Separation of 
 Duties) and FB*3.5*172 (Security Keys for Separation of Duties).
  
 There was also concurrent code developed in the Potential Cost Recovery
 Report via patch FB*3.5*166.  The code in FB*3.5*166's version of routine
 ^FBPCR3 was merged into FB*3.5*163 during pre-production IOC testing.
