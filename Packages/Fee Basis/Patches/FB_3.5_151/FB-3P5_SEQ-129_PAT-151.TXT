Description:
============

 This is the first of two Fee Basis patches for the VistA Fee Separation of
 Duties project.  This patch enhances Fee Basis to retain historical data
 for selected fields in order to maintain complete records on actions for
 accounting, information integrity and control. The second patch, 
 FB*3.5*154, will be released at a later time and it contains enhancements 
 to enforce separation of duties.
  
 Patch FB*3.5*151 will enhance the Fee Basis package as follows:
  
 1. RETAIN DATE OF REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION LETTER
  
    This patch adds the DATE REQ INFO SENT (#19.6) field to the FEE BASIS
    UNAUTHORIZED CLAIMS (#162.7) file. This field contains the most recent
    date a request for additional information letter was sent for the
    claim. This field is automatically populated by the software when 
    letters are generated and when the Update Date Letter Sent [FBUC UPDATE
    DATE LETTER SENT] option is used. The field will not reflect activity
    that occurred prior to installation of the patch.
  
  
 2. AUDIT VALUE OF 13 DATA FIELDS FOR UNAUTHORIZED CLAIMS
  
    This patch enhances the software to maintain a history of changes to 
    the value of thirteen fields in the FEE BASIS UNAUTHORIZED CLAIMS 
    (#162.7) file. The system will retain the date and time of the change,
    the old value, the new value, and the person that made the change.  
    Once the patch is installed the system will retain this information for
    the following fields:
       STATUS  (#24)
       DISPOSITION  (#10) 
       DATE CLAIM RECEIVED  (#.01) 
       DATE REQ INFO SENT (#19.6)
       DATE VALID CLAIM RECEIVED  (#7)
       DATE OF DISPOSITION  (#11)
       REOPEN CLAIM DATE  (#21)
       NOTICE OF DISAGREEMENT RECV'D  (#50)
       STATEMENT OF THE CASE ISSUED  (#51)
       DATE SUBSTANTIVE APPEAL RECV'D  (#52)
       DATE APPEAL DISPOSITIONED  (#53)
       DATE APPEALED TO COVA  (#54)
       DATE COVA APPEAL DISPOSITIONED  (#55)
  
  
 3. MODIFY DISPLAY UNAUTHORIZED CLAIM OPTION
  
    This patch modifies the Display Unauthorized Claim [FBUC DISPLAY 
    UNAUTHORIZED] option to optionally show historical data. After a claim
    has been selected the option will either state there is no historical
    audit data for the claim or it will ask 'Show historical audit data?
    NO//'.  If the user responds YES to the question the output will
    include a new section that displays all changes to the value of the 
    thirteen monitored fields since installation of this patch.
  
    An example of the new output section follows:
  
                < HISTORICAL AUDIT DATA (since patch FB*3.5*151)>
  
  CHANGED DATE/TIME: MAR 12, 2014@14:13:18
    FIELD: NOTICE OF DISAGREEMENT RECV'D  NEW VALUE: MAR 12, 2014
    CHANGED BY: FEECLERK,FIRST A
  CHANGED DATE/TIME: MAR 12, 2014@14:13:19
    FIELD: STATUS                         OLD VALUE: DISPOSITIONED
    NEW VALUE: APPEAL/NOTICE OF DISAGREE RECV
    CHANGED BY: FEECLERK,FIRST A
  
  
 4. AUDIT VALUE OF 5 DATA FIELDS FOR AUTHORIZATIONS
  
    This patch enhances the software to maintain a history of changes to 
    the value of five fields in the AUTHORIZATION multiple of the FEE BASIS
    PATIENT (#161) file. The system will retain the date and time of the
    change, the old value, the new value, and the person that made the
    change.  Once the patch is installed the system will retain this
    information for the following fields:
       FROM DATE (#.01)
       TO DATE (#.02)
       DISCHARGE TYPE (#.06)
       PURPOSE OF VISIT CODE (#.07)
       TREATMENT TYPE CODE (#.095)
  
  
 5. ADD HISTORICAL AUTHORIZATION DATA REPORT 
  
    This patch adds a new menu option called Historical Authorization Data
    Report [FBAA AUTH DATA AUDIT RPT]. The option displays the current 
    authorization data and the historical audit data for an authorization.
    The historical audit data displays all changes to the value of the five
    monitored fields since installation of this patch. This option is
    located on the Outputs Main Menu [FBAA OUTPUTS MENU] under the Medical
    Fee Main Menu [FBAA MEDICAL MAIN MENU].
  
    An example of the new report follows:
  
  Historical Authorization Data Report             MAR 13, 2014@15:11:09
  Patient: FEEPATIENT,FEE C   Pt.ID: 000-00-5401
