Description:
============

  
  
  Patch QAO*3*9 addresses 3 issues:
       
        1.  QAOS 107 screen requires VDL documentation change (MAJOR 
            surgery)
        2.  QAOS 101.1 screen not reporting unscheduled 10 day re-
            admissions when scheduled admission occurs on same day
        3.  QAOS 109 screen reporting duplicate death entries, due to
            time of death change

   Remedy Overview:
   ================
   1)   INC000000336615   QAOS 107 Screen - Return to OR in same admission
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Code only includes MAJOR surgery procedures, but documentation does 
    not state that the type must be MAJOR in the QA Occurrence Screen User 
    Manual. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The Occurrence Screen V.3.0 User Manual will be updated to clarify
    that surgery must be MAJOR.  
   
  
   2)  INC000000495505    QAOS 101.1 Screen - Readmission within 10 days
  
    Problem:
    --------
    QAOS 101.1 screen is not reporting the correct patients.  Software was
    designed to report on only unscheduled (re)admissions.  A scheduled
    admission would not be picked up. The issue is that only the date is
    checked for these admissions -- not the date/time.  A scheduled
    admission on the same day as an unscheduled (re)admission will prevent
    the unscheduled (re)admission from being reported.
     
    Resolution:
    -----------
    New subroutine SCHED2^QAOC0 was developed (and called by MAIN+1^QAOC1011),
    since the original SCHED subroutine is called by code for another QAO 
    screen. The new subroutine will check both date and time.
  
  
   3)  INC000000966125   QAOS 109 Screen - Death 
   
    Problem:
    --------
    There has been a reported issue that deals with duplicate entries being
    displayed with regards to death count.  Further research confirmed that when
    time of death was changed, a patient could be picked up on the 109 screen a
    second time.  
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ^QAOC109 was modified to make sure a patient does not exist on
    the 109 screen, prior to the current run.   New subroutine LOOP2 was
    written to accomplish this task.
