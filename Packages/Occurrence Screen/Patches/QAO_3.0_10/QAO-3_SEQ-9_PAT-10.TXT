 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000001255484 - QA-Occurrence Screen - 107 no longer working
                      
    Problem:
    --------
    After the release of patch SR*3.0*182, the Return to OR in same 
    admission (Screen 107) screen no longer works. The 107 screen requires
    a surgery to be classified as MAJOR, however users are no longer prompted
    to enter a value for the SURGERY (#130) file's MAJOR/MINOR (#.03) field 
    when using the Operation Startup [SROMEN-START] option. Additionally, in 
    SR*3.0*182 the SURGERY (#130) file's IN/OUT-PATIENT STATUS (#.011) field 
    has been renamed to the HOSPITAL ADMISSION STATUS (#.011) field. The 107 
    screen requires this field to have a value of I:INPATIENT, however the 
    new acceptable values for this field are 1:SAME DAY, 2:ADMISSION, or 
    3:HOSPITALIZED.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine QAOC107 to remove the conditional check for the 
    SURGERY (#130) file's MAJOR/MINOR (#.03) field. Also, modified 
    the conditional check on the SURGERY (#130) file's HOSPITAL ADMISSION 
    STATUS (#.011) field to accept any value other than NULL or O:OUTPATIENT.
    The Occurrence Screen User Manual has also been updated to reflect these
    changes.
