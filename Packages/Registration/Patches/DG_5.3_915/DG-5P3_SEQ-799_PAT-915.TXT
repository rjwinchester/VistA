Subject: ENTERPRISE REGISTRATION - MVI ITERATION 14

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 *************************************************************************
 * This patch may be installed with users on the system, however because *
 * the patient lookup routines are being exported with this patch, we    *
 * strongly advise that it be installed after business hours.            *
 *************************************************************************
  
 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) enhancements are being distributed in
       three VistA namespaces: DG, RG and MPIF.
       The enhancements related to this patch are only being distributed in
       the DG and MPIF VistA namespaces. MPIF*1.0*61 should be installed
       before DG*5.3*915 for non-legacy sites (do NOT install MPIF*1.0*61
       on legacy sites), as the new registration functionality being 
       exported in this patch will not work without MPIF*1.0*61. 
       Therefore it is recommended that these patches be installed in the
       following order on non-legacy sites: 
              MPIF*1.0*61 and then DG*5.3*915.
  
 NOTE: Legacy sites can install just the DG*5.3*915 patch and there is
       code in place that will continue to execute as before without
       MPIF*1.0*61 installed. MPIF*1.0*61 should NOT be installed on 
       legacy sites.
  
  
 This enhancement patch updates the option Register a Patient [DG REGISTER 
 PATIENT] to utilize the new Enterprise Registration processes to improve 
 the Veterans' experience at VA facilities by allowing new local patients 
 to be looked up directly in the Master Veteran Index (MVI).  The data 
 from the new patient's MVI record is automatically imported into the 
 local site and an attempt is made to obtain the Enrollment System (ES)
 data when possible.  In addition, this Enterprise Registration also 
 allows for lookup and import of Department of Defense (DoD) data if the
 patient is a new patient to the VA system.
  
 New Process:
 Within the Register a Patient [DG REGISTER PATIENT] option, the initial
 patient lookup search remains unchanged.  If only one patient is found
 locally then the registration staff is asked to confirm that this is the
 patient they are attempting to register, if not then they are asked if
 they want to do an Enterprise Search.  If multiple local patients are
 found and none are selected, then they are asked if they want to do an
 Enterprise Search.  If no local patient is found, they are asked if they
 want to do an Enterprise Search.  In any case if the registration staff
 chooses not to do an Enterprise Search when asked they are returned to
 the Select PATIENT prompt.  All NEW patients created via the Register a
 Patient [DG REGISTER PATIENT] option will now require an Enterprise 
 Search to be able to add the patient to the local VistA system.
  
 Upon choosing to do an Enterprise Search the registration staff is 
 presented with a series of prompts to obtain the search criteria.  If 
 insufficient criteria is entered, a message is displayed and the search 
 criteria is prompted again.  Upon entering sufficient data a query is 
 sent to the MVI to attempt to find matches.  If no match is found on the 
 MVI, the query is automatically sent to DoD to find possible matches as 
 well.
  
 If matches are found then they are presented to the registration staff to 
 review the records and select from the matches found.  The list of 
 possible matches are grouped as Auto Link or Potential Match.  Upon 
 selection of a match, the data from the MVI (or DoD) is automatically 
 loaded into the new patient's record.  If the patient is already enrolled 
 in the VA system, a query is sent to obtain the patient's enrollment 
 record prior to entering the registration screens.  After which time the 
 registration process continues as normal.
  
 If too many matches are found, the registration staff are informed and 
 asked to provide updated search criteria to find a more limited search 
 result list from which to select.
  
 If no matches are found then the registration staff is asked if they want 
 to add the new patient.
  
 If any matches are returned that are above the Auto Link threshold, the 
 registration staff must select one of the patients returned from the 
 query (Auto Link threshold or Potential Match threshold) or hold the new 
 security key 'DG MVI ADD PT' to override the selection.

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions
 ------------------------------------ 
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this
 patch is available.
   
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
 directory at: ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as follows:
   
  Albany         ftp.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Hines          ftp.domain.ext   <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
   
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library at:

 Patch Installation:
   
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There are no Pre/Post installation routine processes. 
  
 Note: Ensure that the post-install steps in MPIF*1.0*61 were completed to
 update the MPI_PSIM_EXECUTE web server entry in your production account
 to ensure it is directed at the MVI load balancer. This will ensure Health
 Level Sever (HL7) messages are reliably routed when specific nodes are down.
 See patch MPIF*1.0*61 for details.  
   
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 ----------------------------- 
 This patch takes less than 2 minutes to install.  This patch may be 
 installed with users on the system, however because the patient lookup 
 routines are impacted, we strongly advise that it be installed after 
 business hours.
   
 The following OPTIONs should be disabled during installation:
      Load/Edit Patient Data                      [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
      Register a Patient                          [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
      Preregister a Patient                       [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]
      Electronic 10-10EZ Processing               [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING] 
      Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES]
  
 The HL7 incoming filers should be stopped.  Use the Monitor, Start, Stop
 Filers [HL FILER MONITOR] option on the Filer and Link Management Options
 [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu on the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU].
  
   
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
   
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch 
     number (i.e. DG*5.3*915):
   
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
       
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
   
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//', respond as per your facility's policy.  If you
     choose to answer YES, then at the end of the patch installation,
     KIDS will rebuild the menus which may take several hours and could
     disrupt CPRS users.  If your facility has the XQBUILDTREEQUE
     nightly batch job tasked to run, answer NO to this question.
     The nightly job will rebuild the menus as scheduled.
   
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
     respond NO.
