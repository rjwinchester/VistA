Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
  Note:  DG*5.3*855 is being released along with IVM*2*153 (Income
         Verification Match) in host file: DG_53_P855.KID.
  
         It is imperative that these patches be installed no later than the
         compliance date.  Your understanding and support is appreciated.
  
 **************************************************************************
  
  
  Patch DG*5.3*797 added the new MILITARY SERVICE EPISODE sub-file #2.3216 
  in the PATIENT (#2) file to store Military Service Episode (MSE) data.
  Changes in that patch included modifications to several consistency 
  checks that used MSE data.  The consistency checks that are listed in 
  the DG*5.3*797 patch description are correctly using the new MILITARY
  SERVICE EPISODE sub-file #2.3216 and the new Screen 6.1 to edit the data.
  
  However, there is a set of consistency checks in the INCONSISTENT DATA 
  ELEMENTS (#38.6) file that are considered related to Eligibility.   If 
  any of those inconsistencies are edited; the user is prompted with a set
  of eligibility-related fields that include the Last Service Episode 
  fields.  Since these inconsistencies were not modified for DG*5.3*797, 
  the user is being prompted with the old MSE fields for SERVICE EPISODE 
  [LAST].  These are the inconsistencies that are considered related to 
  Eligibility:
  
    9            VETERAN STATUS UNSPECIFIED
    10           SC PROMPT UNANSWERED
    11           SC PROMPT INCONSISTENT
    12           SC% UNSPECIFIED FOR SC VET
    13           POS UNSPECIFIED
    14           ELIG CODE UNSPECIFIED
    18           ELIG/VET STATUS INCONSISTENT
    19           ELIG/NONVET STAT INCONSISTENT
    20           ELIG/SC% INCONSISTENT

    24           POS/ELIG CODE INCONSISTENT

  This patch is being released with patch IVM*2.0*153 in host file

  Problem:
  --------
  There is a set of consistency checks in the INCONSISTENT DATA ELEMENTS 
  (#38.6) file that are considered related to Eligibility.   If any of 
  those inconsistencies are edited; the user is prompted with a set of
  eligibility-related fields that include the Last Service Episode

  the user is being prompted with the old MSE fields for SERVICE EPISODE
  [LAST].  These are the inconsistencies that are considered related to

  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routines DGRPCE and DGRPCE1 are being edited to allow users to edit the
  new MSE data in sub-file #2.3216 on the new screen 6.1, with any of the 
  eligibility-related inconsistencies.
