 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1)  INC000000626738    Field #24-Appointment Type Sub-Category in the Patient
                        File (#2) is not assigned    
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The APPOINTMENT TYPE SUB-CATEGORY field (#24) of the APPOINTMENT sub-file 
 (#2.98) of the PATIENT file (#2), which is a pointer to the SHARING 
 AGREEMENT SUB-CATEGORY file (#35.2), is not assigned properly.
  
 When making an appointment using the Appointment Management [SDAM APPT 
 MGT] option, if the user enters SHARING AGREEMENT as the Appointment Type,
 the Registration Application Program Interface (API) will present an 
 additional prompt for the user to enter the Appointment Type sub-category.
 If there is no selection made, the application times out or user enters an
 (^) up-arrow to exit prompt, the API returns a value of zero, which is 
 filed into APPOINTMENT TYPE SUB-CATEGORY field (#24).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine ^DGSAUTL to return a Null value when there is no selection
 made, application times out or user exits prompt with the "^" selection.
  
  
 2)  INC000000772240    Patient Address Update option 
   
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the Patient Address Update [DG ADDRESS UPDATE] option the city,
 state and zip code appears twice in the view for the Temporary Address.
 Also, after the county name there is a () showing.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine ^DGADDUTL to only display () if there is a Catchment Code
 for that county and to only display the address once.
