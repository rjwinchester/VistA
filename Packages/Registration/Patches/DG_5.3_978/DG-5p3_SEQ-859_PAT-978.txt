Description:
============

 Patch DG*5.3*978 is being released to support the enhancements for the
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 project.
  
 NOTE: DG*5.3*978 is being released with IVM*2.0*180 in Host File    
       DG_53_P978.KID. 
       
 Patch DG*5.3*978 is also being released in support of the Enrollment
 System (ES) 5.6 release. Refer to Informational Patch EAS*1*178
 (Enrollment Application System) for additional details regarding the ES
 release.
  
 Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 Registration, Eligibility & Enrollment (REE) currently does not allow a
 user to request an initial appointment for a newly enrolled Veteran after
 registration. Welcome To My VA (W2myVA) makes an outbound call from a VA
 representative in conjunction with the introductory letter and
 personalized handbook each Veteran receives upon enrollment. If the 
 Veteran requests an appointment during that conversation, the VistA
 Preferred Facility cannot change the Appointment Request to YES. As a
 result, the Veteran will not show on the local New Enrollee Appointment
 Request (NEAR) list to disposition the Veteran's appointment. The Veteran
 is kept on the W2myVA reports, negatively impacting the W2myVA reporting
 that captures the total amount of time Veterans wait to be scheduled for
 an appointment.
  
  
 Patch DG*5.3*978 provides a mechanism for updating the appointment request
 field from NO to YES after registration via the Management Edit [DGEN 
 NEACL REQUEST MGT EDIT] option.  
  
 The Management Edit Call List [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1] and Tracking Report 
 [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT2] options are modified, and new fields are added to 
 the database to track the original appointment request and original
 request date made during registration.
  
 Currently there is no mechanism for a VistA user to add a Veteran to the
 local NEAR list, unless the user indicates the Veteran wants to be seen 
 by a doctor when completing a VA Form 10-10EZ in ES, VistA, or online.  
 When the New Enrollee makes an appointment request at the W2myVA follow-up
 phone call, VistA users at the Preferred Facility or an associated
 Satellite Facility need the ability to change the response from NO to
 YES. Once the appointment is requested, it places the Veteran on the
 local NEAR list (Call List [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1], Call List (background
 job) [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1BK] and the Tracking Report [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT2]
 options). This allows a VistA user to disposition the appointment request
 in the Management Edit [DGEN NEACL REQUEST MGT EDIT] option.  Lack of this
 functionality impacts accurate reporting of the total amount of time
 Veterans wait to be scheduled for an appointment.
  
 The Management Edit [DGEN NEACL REQUEST MGT EDIT] option is updated to
 either present an appointment request prompt to the user or to present
 the current prompts for dispositioning an appointment request. The 
 Tracking Report [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT2] option is updated to include a new
 column for the date of the appointment request if the Veteran initially
 answered YES when completing a VA Form 10-10EZ in ES, VistA, or online.
 The Call List [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1] option detailed format includes a new
 row to display the date of the appointment request if the Veteran
 initially answered YES when completing a VA Form 10-10EZ in ES, VistA, or
 online.  
  
 The ^XINDEX issue 'Line is longer than 245 bytes' encountered in Primary 
 Developer Review is due to a Kernel Toolkit defect, it is not due to patch
 DG*5.3*978.  Incident INC4991239 was entered and it will be fixed in patch
 XT*7.3*140.

    report ("APPT.REQUEST") column now displays the appointment request
    date whenever the appointment was requested, including from the 
    Management Edit [DGEN NEACL REQUEST MGT EDIT] option. The report
    includes a new column ("ORIGINAL APPT. REQUEST"). This column is

    question, and does not indicate the Veteran requested an appointment 
    on that date. The Original Appointment Request Date is not used in 
    any other reporting or calculations.

       from "APPOINTMENT REQUEST ON 1010EZ START DATE" to "APPOINTMENT
       REQUEST START DATE" and "APPOINTMENT REQUEST ON 1010EZ END DATE" to
       "APPOINTMENT REQUEST END DATE".

       Report as the 4th column and displays the ORIGINAL APPOINTMENT 
       REQUEST DATE field (#1010.1513) in the PATIENT file (#2). The date 
       of the Veteran's first response to the "Does the New Enrollee
       want an appt. with a VA doctor/provider at [Preferred Facility]?"
       prompt will display in this column.
    c. The Detailed Report layout is modified to abbreviate column
       headings to fit the additional column.

 7. The ORIG APPT REQUEST CHG DT/TM field (#1010.1514) in the PATIENT file
    (#2) will capture the last change date/time of the appointment request

    REQUEST field (#1010.1512) in the PATIENT file (#2) or ORIG APPT 
    REQUEST DATE field (#1010.1513) in the PATIENT file (#2) is updated).
  
 8. Two triggers are added to the APPOINTMENT REQUEST ON 1010EZ field
    (#1010.159) in the PATIENT file (#2) when the field is updated:
    a. The APPT REQUEST 1010EZ CHG DT/TM field (#1010.1515) in the PATIENT
       file (#2) will capture the date/time when APPOINTMENT REQUEST ON 
       1010EZ field (#1010.159) in the PATIENT file (#2) is updated.
    b. The ORIGINAL APPOINTMENT REQUEST field (#1010.1512) in the PATIENT 
       file (#2) captures the value of the APPOINTMENT REQUEST ON 1010EZ
       field (#1010.159) in the PATIENT file (#2) the first time that value
       is set.
  
 9. Two triggers are added to the APPOINTMENT REQUEST DATE field
    (#1010.1511) in the PATIENT file (#2) when the field is updated:
    a. The APPT REQUEST 1010EZ CHG DT/TM field (#1010.1515) in the PATIENT
       file (#2) will capture the date/time when the APPOINTMENT REQUEST
       DATE field (#1010.1511) in the PATIENT file (#2) is updated.
    b. The ORIGINAL APPT REQUEST DATE field (#1010.1513) in the PATIENT 
       file (#2) captures the value of the APPOINTMENT REQUEST DATE field
       (#1010.1511) in the PATIENT file (#2) the first time that value is 
       set. 
  
 10. The HL7 interface with ES is modified to add four additional data
     elements in the ZIO segment of the ORF/ORU-Z11 message.   
     a. Sequence 7: UPDATE DATE/TIME corresponding to APPT REQUEST 1010EZ 
        CHG DT/TM field (#1010.1515) in the PATIENT file (#2).
     b. Sequence 8: ORIGINAL APPOINTMENT REQUEST corresponding to ORIGINAL
        APPOINTMENT REQUEST field (#1010.1512) in the PATIENT file (#2).
     c. Sequence 9: ORIGINAL APPOINTMENT REQUEST DATE corresponding to 
        ORIGINAL APPT REQUEST DATE field (#1010.1513) in the PATIENT file
        (#2).
     d. Sequence 10: UPDATE DATE/TIME corresponding to ORIG APPT REQUEST
        CHG DT/TM field (#1010.1514) in the PATIENT file (#2).
  
    Note: The ZIO segment includes sequence 5 APPOINTMENT REQUEST ON 1010EZ
          corresponding to the APPOINTMENT REQUEST ON 1010EZ field
          (#1010.159) in the PATIENT file (#2) and sequence 6 APPOINTMENT
          REQUEST DATE corresponding to the APPOINTMENT REQUEST DATE field
          (#1010.1511).  
  
 11. When VistA receives an ORF/ORU-Z11 message, the processing of 
     these sequences is as follows:
     a. If the ORIGINAL APPOINTMENT REQUEST field (#1010.1512) in the 
        PATIENT file (#2) is empty, sequences 8, 9 and 10 are stored 
        in their corresponding fields.
     b. If the date/time in the APPT REQUEST 1010EZ CHG DT/TM field
        (#1010.1515) in the PATIENT file (#2) is more recent than the 
        date/time in sequence 7, the data in sequences 5, 6, and 7 are 
        not stored in VistA.
     c. If the APPOINTMENT REQUEST ON 1010EZ field (#1010.159) in the 
        PATIENT file (#2) is YES and sequence 5 is NO, an Application Error
        (AE) is sent back to ES.
     d. If the APPOINTMENT REQUEST DATE in sequence 6 is a future date, an 
        AE is sent back to ES.
     e. Otherwise the data in sequences 5, 6 and 7 are stored in their 
        corresponding fields.
     f. If any sequence being filed contains double quotes (""), the
        corresponding field in VistA is deleted.

 Back-Out/Roll Back Plan:
 ------------------------
 In the event a site determines that this patch should be backed out, the 
 site should submit a YOUR IT Services ticket with the Enterprise Service 
 Desk (ESD) for assistance with the procedure.
  
 Any issues would need to be evaluated to determine if: a back-out of the 
 software is appropriate; a new patch is needed; or if data requires 
 correction or restoration.
   
 During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as
 directed, "Backup a Transport Global", then routines will have the 
 ability to be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was 
 generated. However, the KIDS installation process does not perform a
 backup of other VistA software components, such as DD, cross-reference,
 and template changes.
