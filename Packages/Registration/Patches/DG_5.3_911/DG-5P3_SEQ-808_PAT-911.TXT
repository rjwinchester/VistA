Subject: PATIENT RECORD FLAGS FOR INTEGRATED SITES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch DG*5.3*911 addresses one issue:
       
 Integrated sites working with a Patient Record Flag must first transfer  
 flag ownership to their "main" site and then edit the flag, as needed,
 for other sites to be able to receive/process the incoming Health  
 Level-7 (HL7) messages or else the message is rejected as not coming
 from the owning site.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 INC000001124228  MAS- Patient Record Flag:
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Sites are unable to receive/process incoming Patient Record Flag (PRF)  
 HL7 messages from Integrated sites.  Integrated sites must transfer  
 flag ownership to the "main" site and then edit the flag, as needed,
 so other sites can receive/process the incoming HL7 message.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine DGPFAA3 to remove check of sending facility against 
 Patient Record Flag owning site.  This check is not allowing Integrated 
 site flag edits to be received and processed.
