Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM MODERNIZATION (ESM) EARLY SEPARATION REASON

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Patch DG*5.3*947 is being released to support the enhancements for the
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on 
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 project,
 which supports Enrollment System Community Care (ESCC).
  
 DG*5.3*947 is also being released in support of the Enrollment System (ES)
 5.3 release. Refer to Informational Patch EAS*1*165 (Enrollment
 Application System) for additional details regarding the ES release.
  
 The REASON FOR EARLY SEPARATION (#.09) field within the MILITARY
 SERVICE EPISODE (.3216) multiple within the PATIENT (#2) file is added in 
 Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA) 
 Registration, Eligibility & Enrollment (REE). The data for this field
 will be received from ES in ORF-Z11/ORU-Z11 HL7 messages in the ZMH
 segment. The Reason for Early Separation cannot be edited or deleted
 by VistA users and will not be sent back to ES in a Z07 message.
  
 Note: DBIA 5783  MILITARY SERVICE EPISODE API - DGMSEUTL includes 
 component GETMSE that returns all records in the MILITARY SERVICE EPISODE 
 (#.3216) multiple within the PATIENT (#2) file in the MSE array. While no
 modifications were made to this component, the REASON FOR EARLY SEPARATION
 (#.09) field is included in the returned array.
  
 Listing of Updates
 ==================
 This patch makes the following enhancements to REE:
 1. The REASON FOR EARLY SEPARATION (#.09) field within the MILITARY 
    SERVICE EPISODE (#.3216) multiple within the PATIENT (#2) file is
    added.
  
 2. The FUTURE DISCHARGE DATE (#.08) field within the MILITARY SERVICE
    EPISODE (#.3216) multiple within the PATIENT (#2) file is modified to
    be NONEDITABLE.
  
 3. The HL7 interface with ES is modified to include the additional data
    element of "REASON FOR EARLY SEPARATION" that is associated with each
    MSE. The ORU-Z11 message contains a new sequence, #9, in the ZMH
    segment for the "REASON FOR EARLY SEPARATION".
  
 4. MSEs that contain a REASON FOR EARLY SEPARATION will not be included 
    in the ORU-Z07 or ORF-Z07 messages sent to ES.
  
 5. The following VistA menu options were modified to display the Reason 
    for Early Separation:
    a.  View Registration Data     [DG REGISTRATION VIEW]
    b.  Load/Edit Patient Data     [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
    c.  Register a Patient         [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
    d.  Eligibility Verification   [DG ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION]
    e.  Preregister a Patient      [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]
    f.  Admit a Patient            [DG ADMIT PATIENT]
    
    Note: In the Preregister a Patient [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION] option,
    the field is shown only if there are MSE inconsistencies in the record.
  
 6. The VistA REE system displays the Reason for Early Separation on
    the following screens as view-only next to the caption "Early 
    Separation Reason:" (screen mockups below):
    a.  Military Service Data, Screen <6>
