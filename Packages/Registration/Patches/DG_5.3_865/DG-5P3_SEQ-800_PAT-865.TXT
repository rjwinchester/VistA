  The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the

  (VistA REE) software to support the requirements of the Email Address
  Indicator initiative.
   
  This patch modifies the Registration v5.3 application as described below:
   
  1.  Add an Email Address Indicator field.
  -----------------------------------------
   
  - A new field, EMAIL ADDRESS INDICATOR (#.1316) has been added to the
    PATIENT file (#2).  Valid values for the Email Address Indicator field
    shall be "YES" or "NO", and shall be a required field.  An existing
    Email Address shall be deleted if the user answers NO to the Email
    Address Indicator prompt DOES THE PATIENT HAVE AN EMAIL ADDRESS? Y/N?
    The Email Address Indicator will not be displayed in VISTA.
   
  2.  Add an Email Address Indicator field date/time stamp.
  ---------------------------------------------------------
   
  - A new field, EMAIL ADDRESS INDICATOR DT/TM (#.1317) has been

 KNOWN ISSUES: 
 -------------
 Three issues have been found during IOC testing related to using the
 contributed to spouse or child indicators in lieu of the amount contributed to
 spouse or child values.  All three issues will be fixed in subsequent patches
 to be deployed approximately 2 months after release of this host file.
 
 Issue 1: When a Veteran's income test Married Last Year value is "Yes" and the
 Contributed to Spousal Support field has a stored value; updating the Married
 Last Year value to "No" does not remove the value in the Contributed to Spousal
 Support field.  The Contributed to Spouse value continues to display on the
 income test screens.  The user must remove the spouse from the means test prior
 to changing the Married Last Year value to "No".  This ensures the spouse is
 appropriately not counted as a dependent and their income is not included in
 the calculation of the means test status, copay test status, or enrollment
 determination.  The issue appears to be isolated to the display on the income
 test and should not cause any negative impact to processing.
 
 Solution 1: Work Item 235262 was entered to address the issue.  Requirements
 on how to handle the display will be forthcoming and the solution will be
 released in patch DG*5.3*923.
 
 Issue 2:  The 10-10EZ and 10-10EZR forms were updated to ask the Veteran if
 their spouse or child did not live with them did they provide support in lieu
 of asking for the amount contributed to spouse or child.  The amount
 contributed to spouse and child fields were replaced by contributed to spouse
 or child yes/no indicators for determining whether the spouse should be counted
 as a dependent on the income test.  The 10-10EZ form does not print the
 indicator of yes or no in Block 3 of the Dependent Information and the 10-10EZR
 form always prints "No" regardless of the indicator stored values.  The issue
 appears to be isolated to the printing of the 10-10EZ and 10-10EZR forms in
 VistA.  The income test is shared with the Enrollment System (ES).  The ES
 10-10EZ and 10-10EZR forms print the yes or no indicator on the form correctly.
 
 Solution 2: Work Item 219329 was entered to address the issue.  Printing of
 the forms may be done through the Enrollment System (ES) until patch EAS*1*135
 is released to correct the issue.  
 
 Issue 3:  When a Veteran does not live with their spouse and contributes to
 their support, the spouse's income information is not printed on the 10-10EZ
 form or 10-10EZR form in VistA.  The issue appears to be isolated to the
 printing of the 10-10EZ and 10-10EZR forms in VistA.  The income test is shared
 with the Enrollment System (ES).  The ES 10-10EZ and 10-10EZR forms print the
 spouse's income on the form correctly.  
 
 Solution 3: Work Item 235260 was entered to address the issue.  Printing of
 the forms may be done through the Enrollment System (ES) until patch EAS*1*135
 is released to correct the issue.
 
    
    
  Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
  =====================================
  Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by 
  this patch is available.
   
  The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.  This transmits the files from the 
  first available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve software
  directly from a specific server as follows:
   
         OI&T FIELD OFFICE       FTP ADDRESS                DIRECTORY

 Note:  There are two separate host files (DG_53_P865.KID and DG_53_P891.KID),
 containing multiple Registration (DG) patches, that require updates to the
 User Manual-Registration Menu document.  These host files are being released
 together to support the ECE and ESE projects.  All changes to the User
 Manual-Registration Menu documentation for these DG patches can be found in
 the DG_5_3_P891_REG_UM.PDF file.
