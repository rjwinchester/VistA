Subject: VETERANS HEALTH IDENTIFICATION CARD (VHIC) APPLICATION, VERSION 4.3

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC) web application version 4.3
 provides several upgrades and enhancements within the national release of
 VHIC.
  
 Enhancements:
 =============
  
   - Specific Veteran Address Handling 
       o Domestic/foreign address indicator so that non-US addresses are
         clearly distinguishable.
       o Display province and Postal code (instead of state and Zip code)
         for non-US addresses.
       o Display address type (always permanent for this release).
       o Allow associate to choose to deliver card to displayed address, or
         alternatively to the requesting facility address.
       o Display bad address indicator message, if present.
       o If permanent address is flagged as bad, or is missing required 
         information (such as the zip code), or includes a SSN in line
         1/2/3, display message indicating that card must be sent to
         facility, or that the veteran needs to correct the information
         before completing the card request.
       o Update guidance on this screen to clearly reflect the address will
         be used for mailing the card, and that this is not part of the
         identification process.
  
   - Veteran Picture Availability
       o A change is being made to the flow to create an MVI Correlation at
         the time the card request is sent to the print vendor instead of
         waiting for the confirmation file to know that the card has been
         printed and mailed.  This will allow the photo to be available as
         soon as the VHIC request is completed, and will avoid the problems
         we're seeing where a card can appear in a Veteran's hands before
         being activated if the transmission of the Confirmation file is
         delayed.
  
   - Isolation Methods for Downtime
       o Isolate end-users from the VHIC application during downtime or 
         maintenance periods so that those users cannot access the
         application.  Only the maintenance team will have access to the
         VHIC application during this time.  The maintenance banner page
         provided by eBenefits will be redesigned for VHIC and displayed to
         inform general users that the VHIC page is down.
  
  
  
 Implementation:
 ===============
 The VHIC 4.3 is a centrally managed web-based application and will be 
 implemented as a one-time rollout by the VHIC Technical team (Insignia). 
 No software will be installed at the facilities.
