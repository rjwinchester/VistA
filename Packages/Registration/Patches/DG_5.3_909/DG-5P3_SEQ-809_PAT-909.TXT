============

 **************************************************************************
  
      This patch is being released in support of the Camp Lejeune -
      Veterans project. DG*5.3*909 (Registration) is being released along
      with IVM*2*161 (Income Verification Match) in host file:
      DG_5_3_P909.KID.
   
      It is imperative that these patches be installed no later than the
      compliance date. Your understanding and support is appreciated.
  
 **************************************************************************
  
 Public Law 112-154, requires Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide hospital
 care and medical services to Veterans who served on active duty at Camp
 Lejeune (North Carolina) for one or more of 15 specified illnesses or
 conditions (Esophageal cancer; Lung cancer; Breast cancer; Bladder cancer;
 Kidney cancer; Leukemia; Multiple myeloma; Myelodysplastic syndromes;
 Renal toxicity; Hepatic steatosis; Female infertility; Miscarriage;
 Scleroderma; Neurobehavioral effects; or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). To be 
 eligible for care under the provisions of this bill, the Veteran must 
 have served on active duty at Camp Lejeune for not fewer than thirty (30) 
 consecutive or nonconsecutive days between August 1, 1953 and December 31,
 1987.
  
 The Camp Lejeune - Veterans (CL-V) project will update VistA to allow for
 the accurate tracking of veterans who satisfy the CL-V eligibility
 requirements and are therefore entitled to these additional benefits.
  
  
 This patch modifies the Registration v5.3 application as described below:
  
 1. Adds the following fields to the PATIENT (#2) file for storing the 
 Camp Lejeune data:
  
  -CAMP LEJEUNE (#.321701) field - Updated by VistA users or by processing
   an ORF-Z11 or ORU-Z11 message from ES containing Camp Lejeune data.
   Values are Null (Blank), YES or NO. Once the field contains a YES or NO
   value, it cannot be set back to Null.
                                   
  -CAMP LEJEUNE DATE (#.321702)- Updated by the system when the CAMP
   LEJEUNE (#.321701) field is updated.
             
  -CAMP LEJEUNE CHANGE SITE (#.321703) - Updated by the system when the
   CAMP LEJEUNE (#.321701) field is updated.
                      
  -CAMP LEJEUNE SOURCE (#.321704) - Updated by the system when the CAMP
   LEJEUNE (#.321701) field is updated.
                            
  -CAMP LEJEUNE DATA ENTRY LOCKED (#.32171) - Updated by the system when
   an ORF-Z11 or ORU-Z11 message processes Camp Lejeune data. Values are
   "1" for LOCKED, "0" for NOT LOCKED.
  
  
 2. Adds the following fields to the PATIENT ENROLLMENT (#27.11) file for 
 storing the Camp Lejeune data:
                                       
  -CAMP LEJEUNE INDICATED? (#50.24) - Updated by the system when the CAMP
   LEJEUNE (#.321701) field is updated. Values are Null (Blank),YES or NO. 
  
  -CAMP LEJEUNE DATE (#50.25) - Updated by the system when the CAMP 
   LEJEUNE (#.321701) field is updated. 
  
  -CAMP LEJEUNE CHANGE SITE (#50.26) - Updated by the system when the CAMP
   LEJEUNE (#.321701) field is updated. 
  
  -CAMP LEJEUNE SOURCE (#50.27) - Updated by the system when the CAMP 
   LEJEUNE (#.321701) field is updated. 
  
  
 3. Allows editing of CL-V data on the MILITARY SERVICE DATA, SCREEN <6>
    Environmental Factors sub-screen.

      The following menu option allows the VistA user access to view CLE in
      the Environmental Factors screen:

      The following menu option allows the VistA user access to view CLE in
      the Patient Enrollment screen:

 The environmental sub screen has been updated to display a new 
 environmental factor for Camp Lejeune. This new factor will be the 5th 
 in the list as shown below.

 VistA will enable the Camp Lejeune environmental factor for editing if all
 of the following CLE rules are met:
  
    -  Person is a Veteran AND
    -  Person has one or more Military Service Episode(s) (MSE) that include no
       less than 30 days of service between August 1, 1953 and December 31,
       1987 (inclusive) AND
    -  All of the identified MSE(s) used for the 30-day service duration has a
       character of discharge other than:
       -  Dishonorable
       -  Other Than Honorable 
       -  Undesirable
       -  Bad Conduct
       -  Dishonorable-VA (See Note *)
  
 If multiple Military Service Episodes (MSEs) are used to count the 30-day
 service duration requirement, the MSEs do not have to be consecutive days. 
  
    -  If a primary eligibility code exists, it must be a Veteran eligibility
       code as follows:
       -  Service Connected 50% to 100%.
       -  SC Less than 50%
       -  Prisoner of War
       -  Purple Heart Recipient
       -  Aid & Attendance
       -  Housebound
       -  NSC, VA Pension
       -  World War I
       -  NSC
  
    -  The CAMP LEJEUNE DATA ENTRY LOCKED (#.32171) field in the PATIENT
    (#2) file has not been set by uploading the CL-V data from an ORF-Z11
    or ORU-Z11 HL7 message received from ES.
  
 If the veteran does not satisfy the Camp Lejeune eligibility requirements,
 option five will be surrounded by pointed brackets <5> and will not be 
 selectable.
  
 Note: The View Registration Data [DG VIEW REGISTRATION] option is read 
 only. Number five on the ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS screen will be surrounded 
 by pointed brackets <5> and will not be selectable.

 5. Flags a Veteran's record for transmission to ES. When a VistA user
 enters or updates the Camp Lejeune indicator, the record will be flagged
 for transmission and sent to the Enrollment System the next time the IVM
 Background Job completes. ES will process the CL-V data and make an
 enrollment determination, generating an ORU-Z11 to all VistA sites of
 interest. When VistA processes the ORU-Z11 with the Camp Lejeune data in
 VistA, the CAMP LEJEUNE DATA ENTRY LOCKED (#.32171) field in the PATIENT
 (#2) file will be set to "1" for "LOCKED" and the Camp Lejeune indicator
 will no longer be editable within VistA. From this point forward, the Camp
 Lejeune option five will appear with the pointed brackets <5> and all
 future updates to the CL-V data will need to be coordinated through the
 Health Eligibility Center (HEC) via the HEC Alert process.
  
  
 6. Adds help text. When the Camp Lejeune environmental factor is selected,
 the user receives the prompt "CAMP LEJEUNE WATER CONTAMINANT EXPOSURE
 INDICATED?//". The user may solicit help by entering double question marks
 "??" at the prompt. The following help text will display:
  
 SELECT AN ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR (1-5) OR (Q)UIT: QUIT// 5  Camp Lejeune
 CAMP LEJEUNE WATER CONTAMINANT EXPOSURE INDICATED?//??
  
 Enter "Y" if veteran claims need for care of conditions related to 
 exposure of "Water Contamination at Camp Lejeune". Enter "N" if veteran
 was not assigned to Camp Lejeune between August 1, 1953 and December 31,
 1987 or does not claim need for care of conditions related to exposure of
 "Water Contamination at Camp Lejeune".
  
 Choose from:
 Y YES
 N NO
 Null "Blank"
  
  
 7. Displays CL-V data on the Patient Enrollment Screen.
    Related Option: Patient Enrollment [DGEN PATIENT ENROLLMENT]
  
 The Camp Lejeune data is added to Page 2 of the Patient Enrollment 
 screen, directly below the SW Asia Cond display. This is a display only 
 screen and no editing of the Camp Lejeune data is allowed. The SW Asia 
 Cond display prompt is modified to display a colon rather than a period 
 and align properly. The following is an example of the updated screen 
 display:

 8. Modifies the initial enrollment determination algorithm to place CL-V 
 eligible Veterans in priority group 6 unless a higher priority is 
 determined based on other eligibility factors. No changes were made to 
 continuous enrollment rules in VistA. CL-V eligible Veterans are subject 
 to means testing and/or Rx copay testing, unless other eligibility factors
 make them income testing exempt.
  
  
 9. Updates the ORF-Z11 and ORU-Z11 receivers to process the CL-V data 
 sent from ES in ZEL segment sequences 41 through 44.

     on the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU].
