Description:
============

 After the installation of the DG*5.3*850 patch, sites reported these 
 three issues that are being fixed with this patch:
  
 1. The Census Status Report [DGPT CENSUS STATUS REPORT] is reporting the
    admission ward instead of the last movement ward.
 2. When entering a movement for a Post-Vietnam P.O.S. and the SW Asia
    Service flag has been set, a prompt for establishing the SW Asia
    condition will cause a hard error when answered.
 3. When performing an inquiry in option MPCR INQUIRY [DGPT MPCR
    INQUIRY] a hard error occurs.

 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 1. INC000001065328  
   
    Problem:   
    --------
    Census Status Report is listing the patients' admission ward instead of
    the last ward they were transferred to.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The WARD^DGPTC1 tag was recoded to terminate the loop after getting 
    the last valid ward in the PATIENT MOVEMENT (#405) file.
  
    Technical:
    ----------
    The loop for DG*5.3*850 was missing goto logic with Block Structured 
    logic and was continuing to loop through the movement file back to the 
    admission transfer instead of terminating. The goto logic was 
    replaced with a proper loop terminator.
  
 2. INC000001055316
  
    Problem:   
    --------
    Fee Basis Non-VA patients with Post-Vietnam service and the SW Asia 
    conditions flag set get an error with question marks and get hung in a
    loop when the SW Asia conditions question was asked during a movement
    update.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The DG501F template was edited to correct a typographical error.
  
    Technical:
    ----------
    In template DG501F a jump to after getting prompted for SW Asia 
    Service is hitting a typographical error that sends the navigation to 
    an unlisted tag. The value should be 9350 but is 935. This patch
    changes the tag to 9350.
  
 3. INC000001067402 
  
    Problem:   
    --------
    When using the MPCR INQUIRY [DGPT MPCR INQUIRY] option, a hard error
    occurs after entering the patient.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    In routine DGPTIC10, variable DGPTF0 is preserved prior to doing a
    call.
  
    Technical:
    ----------
    Historically, CEN^DGPTC1 was entrusted with the deletion for DGPTF0.  
    Changes in code caused a call to DGPTIC10 which calls CEN^DGPTC1.  
    CEN^DGPTC1 kills the variable DGPTF0 which is needed by 
    routine DGPTFM71. This would result in a hard error when the value was
    undefined. The calls are now prefaced with a save of DGPTF0 to a 
    local save variable that allows the DGPTF0 to be in existence when 
    control returns.
