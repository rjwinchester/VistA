Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ENHANCEMENTS - DATE OF DEATH UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) enhancements are being distributed in
       two VistA namespaces: DG and MPIF.
       Patches DG*5.3*963 and MPIF*1.0*67 can be installed in any order
       as there are NO dependencies between these patches.
       (Do NOT install MPIF*1.0*67 on legacy sites or on the FORUM CLAIMS
        system). 
   
 NOTE: Legacy sites and the FORUM CLAIMS system can install just the
       DG*5.3*963 patch. MPIF*1.0*67 should NOT be installed on legacy
       sites or on the FORUM CLAIMS system. 
  
 There are no required builds for patch DG*5.3*963.
  
 The following enhancement exported in this patch was requested by the
 Healthcare Identity Management (HC IdM) business group in support of the
 Master Veteran Index (MVI) application. 
   
 Enhancement
 HC IdM has requested that the DESCRIPTION field (#50) in the SUPPORTING
 DOCUMENTATION TYPES File (#47.75) for the following entries be updated
 with the detailed information below:
  
    EVVE CERTIFICATION: 
    Requires receipt of a successful identity match confirming a 
    previously established Date of Death via the EVVE Death Certification 
    Query. Retention of electronic or hard copy documentation of the death 
    certification is required. (Currently available via the EVVE pilot 
    program only)
  
    EVVE FACT OF DEATH QUERY:
    Requires receipt of a successful identity match providing the 
    confirmed Date of Death via one of the three search functions 
    available within EVVE Fact of Death Query:  1) Insurance Regulatory 
    Settlement Agreement, 2) SSN Exact Match, 3) Custom. Retention of
    electronic or hard copy documentation of the returned data is 
    required.  (Currently available via the EVVE pilot program only)
    
    UNDER VA AUSPICES:
    Deaths under VA auspices include deaths where the VA receives a 
    medical record from a non-VA provider documenting a death that occurs 
    while the non-VA provider was furnishing authorized non-VA care; 
    deaths occurring in a contract nursing home (i.e., a nursing home 
    under contract with the VA to care for the individual); or deaths 
    during a home visit when a VA provider is present. Documentation of 
    the death should be received from the non-VA provider or VA provider 
    and entered into the persons record.
    
   NOTE: This information will be displayed to the user when additional
         help text is needed/requested (??) for the 'Supporting Document
         Type' prompt when executing the Death Entry [DG DEATH ENTRY]
         menu option.
