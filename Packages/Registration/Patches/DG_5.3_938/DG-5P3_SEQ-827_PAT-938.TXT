 Health Level Seven (HL7) messages.

 CA TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ===================
 1) R12079614FY17 - Foreign address information not sent from Registration 
                    on HL7 A01 PID segment.
  
    Problem:
    -------- 
    Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), $$EN^VAFCPID and 
    $$EN^VAFHLPID, were not designed to check if a patient's permanent 
    address is foreign and to send province, postal code, and country
    if it is foreign. HL7 A01 event PID segments for foreign addresses
    are sending blank province, postal code and country.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine VAFHLPI2 has been modified to send province, if state is blank,
    to send postal code, if zip code is blank and to send country, if
    country is not UNITED STATES.
