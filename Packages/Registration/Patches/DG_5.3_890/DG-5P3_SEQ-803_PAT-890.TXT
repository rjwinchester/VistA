  *************************************************************************
 
   The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the
   Enrollment System (ES) and the VistA Registration, Enrollment and 
   Eligibility (VistA REE) software for Means Test and RX Copay Test 
   Processing.  The software was modified to use contributed to spouse and
   child Yes/No indicators point forward and no longer capture the amount
   contributed to spouse or child. 
  
 This patch modifies the Registration v5.3 application as described below:
  
 --  Creates a new CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSAL SUPPORT (#.21) field in the INCOME
     RELATION (#408.22) file.  Valid values are Yes (1), No (0), or NULL.
 
 --  Replaces the prompt, "IF YOU DID NOT LIVE WITH SPOUSE, AMOUNT
     CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSE LAST YEAR:" with "IF YOUR SPOUSE DID NOT LIVE
     WITH YOU LAST YEAR, DID YOU PROVIDE SUPPORT:" when entering Marital/
     Dependent Info on the MARITAL STATUS/DEPENDENTS, SCREEN <1> for the
     Means Test or RX Copay Test.  The new prompt will only be presented
     when the Veteran is married or separated and did not live with their
     spouse. The new CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSAL SUPPORT (#.21) in the INCOME
     RELATION (#408.22) file will store the response to the new prompt.  
 
 --  Updates the rules when to prompt the user for spouse financial 
     information on the Means Test or RX Copay Test. 
 
        When the answer to the prompt "IF YOUR SPOUSE DID NOT LIVE WITH YOU
        LAST YEAR, DID YOU PROVIDE SUPPORT:" is YES, the system prompts for
        Spouse financial data.
  
        When the answer to the prompt "IF YOUR SPOUSE DID NOT LIVE
        WITH YOU LAST YEAR, DID YOU PROVIDE SUPPORT:" is NO, the system does 
        NOT prompt for Spouse financial data.  
 
 --  Removes the prompt, "IF YOU DID NOT LIVE WITH CHILD, AMOUNT CONTRIBUTED 
     TO CHILD LAST YEAR:" when entering Marital/Dependent Info on the MARITAL 
     STATUS/DEPENDENTS, SCREEN <1> for the Means Test or RX Copay Test.  
 
 --  Updates the rules when to consider the child a dependent on the Means 
     Test or RX Copay Test. 
 
        When the answer to the prompt "DID YOU CONTRIBUTE TO THE CHILD'S 
        SUPPORT:" is YES, the system considers the child a dependent on the
        Means Test or RX Copay Test.    
  
        When the answer to the prompt "DID YOU CONTRIBUTE TO THE CHILD'S 
        SUPPORT:" is NO, the system does not consider the child a dependent
        on the Means Test or RX Copay Test.  
 
 --  Discontinues storing values to the AMOUNT CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSE 
     field (#.07) and AMOUNT CONTRIBUTED TO CHILD field (#.19) in the 
     INCOME RELATION file (#408.22) based on VistA user input. The Means
     Test and Rx Copay Test will no longer prompt users to enter for these
     two fields.
 
 --  Modifies the MARITAL STATUS/DEPENDENTS, SCREEN <1>: 
 
        To display the "Contributed to Spouse" label and value when the 
        CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSAL SUPPORT (#.21) field in the INCOME RELATION 
        (#408.22) file is populated with a YES/NO value (not NULL).  
 
        To display the "Amount Contributed" label and value when the AMOUNT
        CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSE (#.07) field in the INCOME RELATION (#408.22) 
        file is populated with a value (not NULL) and the value of the 
        CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSAL SUPPORT (#.21) field in the INCOME RELATION 
        (#408.22) file is NULL.
 
        To display the "Contributed to Spouse" label and a value of 
        "Unanswered" when the values in both the CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSAL 
        SUPPORT (#.21) field and the AMOUNT CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSE (#.07)
        field in the INCOME RELATION (#408.22) file are NULL.
 
        To display the "Amount Contributed:" label and value when the AMOUNT
        CONTRIBUTED TO CHILD (#.19) field in the INCOME RELATION (#408.22)
        file is populated with a value (not NULL).
 
        To NOT display the "Amount Contributed:" label when the AMOUNT
        CONTRIBUTED TO CHILD (#.19) field in the INCOME RELATION (#408.22)
        file is NULL.
 
 --  Modifies the HL7 Z07 message builder to share the CONTRIBUTED TO
     SPOUSAL SUPPORT (#.21) field in the INCOME RELATION (#408.22) file
     value with ES in the ZIR-15 segment-sequence.
 
 --  Adds a trigger to flag the record for ORU Z07 message transmission
     when the CONTRIBUTED TO SPOUSAL SUPPORT (#.21) field in the INCOME
     RELATION (#408.22) file is updated.
