 **************************************************************************
 
 The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the VistA
 Registration, Enrollment and Eligibility (VistA REE) software to support
 changes for the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
 
 The Enrollment System (ES) and Standard Data Service (SDS) tables were
 modified to allow ES users to select ACA Preference as a reason when
 canceling or declining the Veterans enrollment.  Currently ES shares
 existing Reason Canceled/Declined codes with VistA via HL7 messaging
 on the Z11 messages in the ZEN-5 segment-sequence.
 
 This patch modifies the Registration v5.3 application as described below:
 
   1.  Allow VistA users to view the REASON CANCELED/DECLINED of
       'ACA Preference' for Veterans while using the Patient Enrollment
       [DGEN PATIENT ENROLLMENT] option.  This code will be received during
       standard transmissions.  No changes were made to HL7 messaging, the
       Z11 receiver or the Patient Enrollment [DGEN PATIENT ENROLLMENT]
       option screens where the Reason Canceled/Declined is currently
       displayed.
 
   2.  Add the 'ACA Preference' reason to the set of codes for the
       CANCELLED/DECLINED REASON (#.05) field of the PATIENT ENROLLMENT
       (#27.11) file. This will allow the 'ACA Preference' reason to upload
       to the REASON CANCELED/DECLINED (#.05) field in the PATIENT ENROLLMENT
       (#27.11) file when received by ES.
