  Remedy Overview:
  ================ 
  1.)  Deletion of admission can cause orphaned nodes   
  
  
  
  Patient Safety Issue:
  ---------------------
  PSPO #2607
  
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Deleting an admission can cause orphaned nodes in the PATIENT MOVEMENT 
  (#405) and PTF (#45) files when 801screen data is linked to the 
  admission. This screen is for the Professional services and will include
  a Current Procedural  Terminology (CPT)code for the procedure used.
  
  
  If an attempt is made to delete an admission via "@" at the ADMISSION 
  DATE prompt in the Admit a Patient [DG ADMIT PATIENT] option, the
  admission record is deleted and then the code checks the Patient
  treatment file(PTF) record. If an 801 screen is present a message  
  "CANNOT DELETE THE PTF RECORD WHEN THERE ARE ACTIVE ORDERS OR CPT
  ENTRIES" is displayed and processing of any other record tied to that
  admission is stopped.
   
  This leaves "hanging" patient movements if the patient had been
  transferred or discharged and the PTF record that were originally
  tied to the admission. The PTF record will then be changed to a Fee 
  Basis Record since there is no admission that can be found and users
  will not be able to delete the 801 or the PTF record for this patient.
  
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Resolution is to add code to patient movement routine (CPTCK^DGPMV3) to 
  disallow deletion of admission if 801 screen data is present.  A message 
  will be displayed, "CANNOT DELETE THE ADMISSION. THE PTF HAS ACTIVE ORDERS
  OR CPT ENTRIES.", and control will return to the ADMISSION DATE prompt.
    
  Routine ^DGPMVDL will also be modified, in the 1^DGPMVDL paragraph, to 
  correct an issue with improper checking of deleted orders and CPT codes. 
  
  
  2.)  Inconsistency 55 issue with Service Connected veterans who agree to 
       copay, but decline to provide income data
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Means Test "Inconsistency 55" (INCOME DATA MISSING) error is being displayed 
  for service connected veterans (with percentages greater than 0% , but 
  less than 50% ) who decline to provide income data, but agree to pay a copay.  
  
     
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Resolution is to add code to consistency check routine (^DGRPC2, CHECK55 
  paragraph).  New code will allow service connected veterans with percentages
  between 0% and 50% to register without income data if they agree to pay copay
  and the copay test status is "NON-EXEMPT".
