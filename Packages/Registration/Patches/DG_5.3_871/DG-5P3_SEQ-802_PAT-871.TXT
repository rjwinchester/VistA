         compliance date.  Your understanding and support is appreciated.
  
  *************************************************************************
   
  The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the 
  Enrollment System (ES) and VistA Registration, Enrollment and
  Eligibility (VistA REE) software to support the requirements of the
  Health Benefit Plan initiative.
   
  This patch modifies the Registration v5.3 application as described below:
   
    --   Creates a new HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN (#25.11) file containing the
         Health Benefit Plans (HBPs) and their
         expanded descriptions.
                                       
    --   Allow VistA to receive the Health Benefit Plans from ES via HL7
         Z11 messages in a new ZHP segment.  The HPBs will not be
         shared on the new segment until this patch is nationally
         released and installed at all VistA sites, and ES turns on the 
         functionality.  The new ZHP segment mapped to the new storage 
         location is defined below:
     
                                                   File# 2- PATIENT

              NUMBER
   
    --   Modifies the Z11 receiver to store the HBPs assigned to a Veteran
         in a new CURRENT HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN (#2511) sub-file in the 
         PATIENT (#2) file. A comparison between the HPBs received on the
         Z11 and the HBPs currently on file in VistA allows VistA to
         appropriately store assigned or un-assigned HBPs by date to a new
         HISTORY HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN (#2512) sub-file in the PATIENT (#2)
         file.
  
    --   Modify Register a Patient [DG REGISTER PATIENT], Load/Edit Patient
         Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA] and View Registration Data [DG
         REGISTRATION VIEW] options to allow users to view HBP profiles for a
         Veteran on a new HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN <11.1> sub-screen accessed via
         the number [5] data group from the ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION DATA,
         SCREEN <11> screen.
    
    --   Allow users to view the HBP history for a Veteran on a new HEALTH
         BENEFIT PLAN <11.3> sub-screen accessed via the VH View History
         protocol on the HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN <11.1> sub-screen.
 
    --   Allow users to view all available HBPs and their expanded
         descriptions via the VD View All HBP Detail protocol on the
         HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN <11.1> sub-screen.
 
    --   Create an API that will provide HBP information to VistA 
         downstream applications to include the HBP Name and HBP 
         Description.
   
 
 The following ICR was added for the API:
