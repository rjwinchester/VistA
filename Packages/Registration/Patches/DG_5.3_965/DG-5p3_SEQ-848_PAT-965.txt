 1. INC0575865-Registration-<SUBSCRIPT>PIVNW+40^VAFHPIVT (Pivot file entry not
               there)
  
    
    Problem:
    --------
    The PIVNW^VAFHPIVT Application Programming Interface (API) for retrieving
    or adding an ADT/HL7 PIVOT (#396.71) file entry has potential to produce a
    <SUBSCRIPT> error if it identifies an existing record, but the record is
    deleted before it is able to access it.
  
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine VAFHPIVT so that after identifying the appropriate record,
    the code will now check to confirm it still exists. If not, it will
    quit processing and return a value of -1 to indicate the record could
    not be found.
  
  
  
  
 2. INC1009955 - Registration - SAM-site is receiving SUBSCRIPT>SAVE+11^DGRPECE
                 error
  
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The cross reference of the PATIENT (#2) file for the NAME (#.01) field
    uses Kernel name standardization APIs to keep the NAME COMPONENTS (#20)
    file record associated with the NAME (#.01) field synchronized with the
    data value stored in that field.  If this data becomes corrupted at the
    site it is highly likely the user will encounter the noted SUBSCRIPT
    error when updating/editing a patient's record using the Register a
    Patient [DG REGISTER PATIENT] option.
  
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine DGRPECE so the SAVE^DGRPECE API used to store
    accepted/edited values into the patient file can properly handle
    corrupted or missing data.
