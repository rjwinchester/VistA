Description:
============

 DG*5.3*428, DG*5.3*712, DG*5.3*797, DG*5.3*800, DG*5.3*825, 
 DG*5.3*857, and DG*5.3*863 are required builds for patch DG*5.3*876.
  
 NOTE: The messaging enhancements for the new SELF IDENTIFIED GENDER
       (#.024) field in the PATIENT (#2) File are being distributed
       in three VistA namespaces: DG, RG and MPIF. The patches should
       be installed in the following order: DG*5.3*876, RG*1.0*61, 
       and then MPIF*1.0*59. After installing DG*5.3*876, it is not
       necessary to wait for the bulletin from the queued Master 
       Patient Index (MPI) Employee data seeding process to complete 
       before moving on with installing RG*1.0*61. However, it is 
       recommended that these three patches be installed within a
       short time window, preferably on the same date if possible.
  
 Issue #1
 The remote procedure call (RPC), VAFC VOA ADD PATIENT, was enhanced
 to include a new optional parameter, PARAM("MBI"), which represents
 the MULTIPLE BIRTH INDICATOR (#994) from the PATIENT file (#2). If 
 provided, it will ensure that when an add/update event is sent to 
 the Master Patient Index (MPI), that the MBI value will be placed on
 the Primary View (PV), the 200 ESR correlation and the preferred 
 facility in the MPI.
 An additional modification was also made to the RPC's processing 
 routine, VAFCPTAD, to replace the 4 slash ('/') stuff in the FileMan
 (FM) call on the VETERAN Y/N field (#1901) in the PATIENT file (#2)
 with 3 slashes ('/') to meet current standards.
  
 Issue #2
 The following Data Dictionary changes have been made to the PATIENT
 (#2) file.
  
 Added the field, SELF IDENTIFIED GENDER (#.024), which is a set of
 codes that allows the patient to identify their preferred sexual
 orientation if they choose to provide that information. 
  
 Added a FIELD INDEX type cross-reference, AVAC024, to the SELF 
 IDENTIFIED GENDER (#.024) field described above.
  
   This new cross-reference makes use of the DG FIELD MONITOR tool
   that was released in patch DG*5.3*527. This tool utilizes the VAFC
   MPIPD FIELD TRIGGER protocol, which creates an entry in the ADT/HL7
   PIVOT (#391.71) file, as well as sets the VAFCF variable to capture
   the fields that have been modified during an edit. This field will
   be included in the Health Level Seven (HL7) 2.4 messages generated
   by the MPI/PD applications. Routine VAFCTR supports this effort.
  
 The post-init routine, DG876PST, will create the new FIELD INDEX type
 cross-reference noted above, and also ensure that auditing is turned
 on.
  
 Issue #3
 Modifications were made to the Patient MPI/PD Data Inquiry option, 
 [RG EXCEPTION TF INQUIRY], to include the following PATIENT (#2) 
 fields so that if they exist, will be viewable upon execution:
  
           - SELF IDENTIFIED GENDER (#.024)
           - PERIOD OF SERVICE (#.323)
   
 Issue #4
 Modifications were made to the ADT-A08 and ACK-A31 Health Level 
 Seven (HL7) messages sent to the Master Patient Index (MPI) to 
 accurately capture the name fields entered or edited in VistA. 
   - The ADT-A08 HL7 message has included an OBX segment which will
     contain the NAME field (#.01) of the PATIENT File (#2), and the
     FAMILY (LAST) LAST NAME (#1), GIVEN (FIRST) NAME (#2), MIDDLE 
     NAME (#3), SUFFIX (#5), and PREFIX (#4) fields of the NAME 
     COMPONENTS File (#20).
   - The ACK-A31 HL7 application acknowledgement sent to the MPI in
     response to an ADT-A31 will include an ERR segment with the
     same data, Patient Name and Name Components, as described in
     the ADT-A08 HL7 message above. 
    
 Issue #5
 Enhancements were made to the ADT-A08 and ACK-A31 HL7 messages sent
 to the MPI to include the following fields from the PATIENT File 
 (#2):
   - SELF IDENTIFIED GENDER (#.024)
   - PERIOD OF SERVICE (#.323)
   - TYPE (#391)
   - VETERAN (Y/N)? (#1901) 
 VETERAN (Y/N)? (#1901) and TYPE (#391) will be located on the ZEL
 segment, PERIOD OF SERVICE (#.323) will be located on the ZSP 
 segment, and SELF IDENTIFIED GENDER (#.024) will be located on the
 OBX segment of the HL7 message.  
  
 Issue #6
 To address Remedy ticket INC000000994947, modifications were made
 to the DPTLK routine to ensure that when a barcode reader converts 
 a Veteran Health Information Card (VHIC) or Department of Defense
 (DOD) Common Access Card (CAC) barcode to lowercase, that the
 barcode input is then converted back to uppercase, matching the
 format that is actually stored, allowing for successful patient 
 lookups.
  
 Issue #7
 A seeding process, for moving PATIENT (#2) records that are of the
 TYPE (#391), "EMPLOYEE", to the Master Patient Index (MPI), will
 be run as part of the post-initialization process in routine, 
 DG876PST. Employee patient records that are found in the PATIENT 
 (#2) file will be transmitted to the MPI using the existing ADT-A31
 Health Level Seven (HL7) message. Emails indicating the process
 completion, number of A31 HL7 messages sent and number of errors
 generated will be transmitted to the user installing the patch, as
 well as to MPI developers.
  
 Issue #8
 Modifications were made to the HL7 EVN segment builder in the 
 VAFCQRY2 routine to address the issue of mismatched DUZ and user name
 being sent to the Master Veteran Index (MVI) in the A08 HL7 update 
 message. User information (DUZ and Name) for the EVN segment will now 
 either come from the ADT/HL7 PIVOT file (#391.71) entry if available 
 or from the user who has scheduled the option, VAFC BATCH UPDATE, to 
 run.

     Start, Stop Filers [HL FILER MONITOR] option on the Filer and
     Link Management Options [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu on the
     HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU].
     
 3.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
     Note: TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display
           the patch text only.
