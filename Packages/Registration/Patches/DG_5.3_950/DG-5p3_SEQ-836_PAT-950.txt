Description:
============

 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) enhancements are being distributed in
       three VistA namespaces: DG, MPIF and RG.
       Patches DG*5.3*950, MPIF*1.0*66 and RG*1.0*69 can be installed in
       any order as there are NO dependencies between these patches
       (Do NOT install MPIF*1.0*66 or RG*1.0*69 on legacy sites or on the
        FORUM CLAIMS system). 
  
 NOTE: Legacy sites and the FORUM CLAIMS system can install just the
       DG*5.3*950 patch. MPIF*1.0*66 and RG*1.0*69 should NOT be
       installed on legacy sites or on the FORUM CLAIMS system.  
  
 DG*5.3*725, DG*5.3*937 and DG*5.3*944 are the required builds for patch
 DG*5.3*950.
  
 Enhancements
 The following enhancements exported in this patch were requested by the
 Healthcare Identity Management (HC IdM) business group in support of the
 Master Veteran Index (MVI) application.
  
 Enhancement #1
 HC IdM has requested that 'EVVE Fact of Death Query' and 'UNDER VA AUSPICES'
 be added as new entries to the SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION TYPES file (#47.75).
 As part of the POST-INSTALL process, the following new entries will be added
 to the SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION TYPES file (#47.75):
  
     SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION TYPE (Field #.01): UNDER VA AUSPICES
                         TYPE CODE (Field #1)  : UVA
                       DESCRIPTION (Field #50) : UNDER VA AUSPICES
  
     SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION TYPE (Field #.01): EVVE FACT OF DEATH QUERY
                         TYPE CODE (Field #1)  : EFDQ
                       DESCRIPTION (Field #50) : EVVE FACT OF DEATH QUERY
  
 Enhancement #2
 HC IdM has also requested that the following additional Date of Death (DOD)
 business rule combinations be added to the SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION BUSINESS
 RULES (#47.761) file to allow for additional selections when entering a 
 patient's death through the Death Entry [DG DEATH ENTRY] menu option:
  
     SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION (Field #.01)  : SPOUSE/NOK/OTHER PERSON
              DOCUMENT TYPE (Field #1..01): UNDER VA AUSPICES
                    ACTIVE? (Field #1..02): YES
  
     SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION (Field #.01)  : EVVE QUERY
              DOCUMENT TYPE (Field #1..01): EVVE FACT OF DEATH QUERY
                    ACTIVE? (Field #1..02): YES
  
 NOTE: These new active DOCUMENT TYPEs will be added as additional entries
       to the existing SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION entries in the SOURCE OF
       NOTIFICATION BUSINESS RULES (#47.761) file during the POST-INSTALL
       process.
  
 Enhancement #3
 HC IdM has requested that the label text of 'Sex' and/or 'Gender' displayed
 in any of the Master Veteran Index (MVI) maintained processes be updated to
 now display 'Birth Sex'. The content for these labels (Sex/Gender) displayed
 in the following menu option will be updated:
   
      -  Patient MPI/PD Data Inquiry [RG EXCEPTION TF INQUIRY]  
  
   Note: Any label displayed utilizing the Data Dictionary (DD) field name
         will NOT be updated as there are no DD changes being made.
  
 Issue #1
 Additional Date of Death (DOD) modifications were required to ensure that
 all appropriate DOD meta data is removed when the patient is determined
 to be no longer deceased. Therefore additional DOD fields were added to the
 list of fields to be updated in routine DGDEATH when it is determined that
 the patient is no longer deceased. Finally, since the Extended Bed Control
 [DG BED CONTROL EXTENDED] menu option can discharge a patient due to death,
 this menu option will be added to the list of supported options in the
 DGDEATH routine that are capable of processing deceased patients.
   
 Issue #2
 HC IdM has determined that there are a few instances at some sites where
 the INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER (#991.01) and the ICN CHECKSUM (#991.02) do
 NOT match the FULL ICN (#991.1) value in the PATIENT (#2) file. The 
 post-install routine DG950PST will perform a check and clean-up if
 necessary any affected records in the PATIENT (#2) file to ensure that the
 FULL ICN (#991.1) value reflects the combination of INTEGRATION CONTROL
 NUMBER (#991.01) and ICN CHECKSUM (#991.02) field data.
   
    Note: This check/clean-up will be queued to the background and an email
          will be generated to the installer and the MVI developers (Only
          for production systems) indicating the start/completion date/times
          number of patient records processed and the total number of 
          patient record entries updated.
  
 In addition, a new remote procedure (RPC) [DG FULL ICN SHOW/UPDATE] was
 created that will allow MVI to do the following remote processes for a
 specific SITE/DFN (Data File Number) pair:
  
      - View the following ICN related fields in the PATIENT File (#2):
  
             * INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER (#991.01)
             * ICN CHECKSUM (#991.02)
             * FULL ICN (#991.1)
  
      - Update an incorrect FULL ICN (#991.1) value in the PATIENT File (#2)
  
 Issue #3
 The Blind Rehab application has reported issues where some patient names
 being retrieved utilizing the Remote Procedure (RPC) [DGRR PATIENT LOOKUP
 SEARCH] are of mixed case, which is problematic to their system. This RPC
 returns the name component values as they are stored in the Data Dictionary
 (DD), even though the DD for the NAME COMPONENTS File (#20) does NOT 
 support the 'Name' fields being mixed case. Therefore the RPC [DGRR PATIENT
 LOOKUP SEARCH] has been modified in 'NAMECOMP^DGRRLU0' to ensure that the
 name component values are always converted to uppercase prior to them being
 returned in the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) document to the requesting
 application.
  
 Issue #4
 The Veterans Online Access (VOA) process was updated in patch DG*5.3*944
 [SEQ #828] to populate the following additional fields when creating a new
 PATIENT (File #2) record:
      
       - FULL ICN (#991.1)
       - WHO ENTERED PATIENT (#.096)
       - DATE ENTERED INTO FILE (#.097) 
  
 However, many facilities reported experiencing issues where the patient
 record was created, but then immediately deleted from the PATIENT (#2)
 file. With consultation from the FILEMAN (FM) Team it was noted that the
 WHO ENTERED PATIENT (#.096) and DATE ENTERED INTO FILE (#.097) fields have
 several triggers attached to them with the '^' as the assigned WRITE
 AUTHORITY security value, which could prevent the record from being
 successfully added to the PATIENT (#2) file. So per the recommendation
 from the FM Team, MVI will remove the WHO ENTERED PATIENT (#.096) and DATE
 ENTERED INTO FILE (#.097) fields from the initial field creation list and
 then populate these additional fields in a subsequent FM call after the
 record has already been successfully created, thereby circumventing the
 potential issue with the WRITE AUTHORITY security values.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview
 -------------------------------------------
 1. I17314893FY18 - MVI not updating Date of Death correctly.
   
 Problem:
 --------
 It was reported by the Administrative End User (AEU) that the Extended
 Bed Control [DG BED CONTROL EXTENDED] and Discharge a Patient
 [DG DISCHARGE PATIENT] menu options within the Registration (DG) package
 are NOT appropriately updating the MVI with the Date of Death (DOD). 
 Ideally this should be done as the changes take place, as Date of Death
 is being overwritten as a result.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine DGDEATH was modified to ensure that all appropriate DOD meta data
 is removed when the patient is determined to be no longer deceased. Also
 the Extended Bed Control [DG BED CONTROL EXTENDED] menu option has been
 added to the list of supported options that are capable of processing
 deceased patients.

         R17448733FY18
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Several sites have reported an issue with the creation of PATIENT (#2)
 file records in VistA through the Veterans Online Access (VOA) process,
 where the new record was reported as created, but then could NOT be
 subsequently located in the PATIENT (#2) file at the site. In consultation
 with the FILEMAN (FM) team, they noted that there are several triggers
 that attempt to update the WHO ENTERED PATIENT (#.096) and DATE ENTERED
 INTO FILE (#.097) fields and that the WRITE AUTHORITY security value of
 these fields is the caret ('^'), which could cause issues during the
 creation of the patient record.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Based upon the FM Team's recommendation, MVI will update the logic in 
 routine VAFCPTAD to remove the WHO ENTERED PATIENT (#.096) and DATE
 ENTERED INTO FILE (#.097) fields from the initial field creation list.
 These fields will now be populated in a second subsequent call during
 the VOA process, which will remove the potential issues with the assigned
 WRITE AUTHORITY security values, allowing the VOA patient records to be
 created and NOT immediately deleted.

 Patch Installation:
   
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The post-installation process will accomplish the following items:
  
  - Add 'EVVE Fact of Death Query' with a TYPE CODE (#1) of 'EFDQ' and
    'UNDER VA AUSPICES' with a TYPE CODE (#1) of 'UVA' as new entries to
    the SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION TYPES file (#47.75).
  - Add the active DOCUMENT TYPE (#1..01) 'EVVE FACT OF DEATH QUERY' to
    the existing SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION (#.01) entry 'EVVE QUERY' in the
    SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION BUSINESS RULES file(#47.761).
  - Add the active DOCUMENT TYPE (#1..01) 'UNDER VA AUSPICES' to the
    existing SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION (#.01) entry 'SPOUSE/NOK/OTHER PERSON'
    in the SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION BUSINESS RULES file (#47.761).
  - Loop through the PATIENT (#2) file global (^DPT) to ensure that the
    FULL ICN (#991.1) reflects the INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER (#991.01) and
    ICN CHECKSUM (#991.02) values. This process will automatically be
    tasked to run in the background and will generate a Mailman message to
    the installer displaying the results upon completion. Execution time
    for this process will vary depending on the number of records stored in
    the site's PATIENT (#2) file and other processes running on the system,
    but from past installations it should average between a few minutes to
    about an hour to complete.

 Menu [HL MAIN MENU]. Routine DG950PST can be deleted if desired once the
 patch has been successfully installed.
  
 Back-Out Plan
 -------------
 The DG back-out procedure would primarily consist of restoring the original
 routines using the back-up message created during the patch installation.
 The stand-alone RPC [DG FULL ICN SHOW/UPDATE] utilized by MVI only, can be
 deleted by the site using FM if desired as it was created as a NEW entry.
 In addition, MVI can remotely inactivate the Source of Notification
 Business Rules created during the post-install of this patch to prevent
 their use if notified of the site's intent of backing out.
      Note: This process should only be done with the concurrence and
            participation of the development team and the appropriate
            VA Site/Region personnel.
