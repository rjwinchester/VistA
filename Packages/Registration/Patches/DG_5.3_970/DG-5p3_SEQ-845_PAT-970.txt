Subject: CORRUPTED SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS IN INCOME PERSON (#408.13) FILE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses Your IT Services incident INC1928289 to fix a 
 critical defect introduced by the ES emergency release 5.3.0.07001, and 
 where the dependent Social Security Number (SSN) data at the VistA 
 facilities was corrupted and requires a VistA patch to clean up the 
 database corruption.  
  
 Please refer to the 'Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview' 
 section of this patch for a description of the problem and its resolution.

 1. Incident: INC1928289 
    Short Description: <SUBSCRIPT>IX+1^DIE1 ^DGPR(408.13 - Error Seen At 
    Multiple Sites
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Critical defect #810016 was logged against Enrollment System (ES) 5.3 
 build.   A new build was created to address the defect.  Emergency 
 Release ES 5.3.0.07001 implemented code changes to remove a method and 
 method calls that were removing the SSN from the ZDP segment and setting 
 it to a single "space" character. Dependent Social Security Number (SSN)
 data at the VistA facilities was corrupted and requires a VistA patch to
 clean up the database corruption.  Upon follow-up with the facilities who
 reported the original error, additional instances of a slightly different
 error were being seen after the deployment of the code fix.  The expected
 outcome is that no errors would be seen after the deployment of ES
 5.3.0.07001.  The error logged in the VistA instances is as follows:
  
   $ZE= <SUBSCRIPT>IX^DIE1 ^DGPR(408.13,"BS","")
  
   K ^DGPR(408.13,"BS",$E(X,6,9),DA)
  
 The error is occurring on the second instance of an inbound financial HL7 
 transmission (ORU-Z10) for a patient.  The root cause was determined to 
 be the data (in this case an empty space) which was filed into the SOCIAL 
 SECURITY NUMBER field (#.09) of the INCOME PERSON file (#408.13). The SSN 
 data in that file was potentially degraded by the initial issue. ES was 
 remediated, the second transmission files the correct data; however, 
 still errors due to the previous value.  A third or higher transmission 
 should file without error.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The post-install routine EP^DG53970P queues off a background job to 
 delete corrupted SSNs in the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (#.09) field of the
 INCOME PERSON file (#408.13).
  
 * This will delete corrupted Social Security Numbers (SSNs) in the
   INCOME PERSON file (#408.13). The routine traverses all records (IENs)
   in the file and if the Social Security Number (#.09) field is a single
   "space" character or the letter "P" preceded by a single "space" 
   character, the field is set to NULL. The IENs are stored in the ^XTMP 
   global for tracking purposes.
  
 * All SSN cross-references for the record are removed.  
  
 * The Patient record (DFN) associated with the record is determined and 
   stored in the ^XTMP global for tracking purposes.
  
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 * Erie VA Medical Center
 * Lebanon, PA (Lebanon VA Medical Center)
 * VA Western New York Healthcare System
  
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ---------------------------------------------------- 
 This software is being released as a patch (PackMan) message.
  
 There is no new or updated documentation being released with this patch.
  
  
 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 The post install process will run routine DG53970P. This routine queues
 off a background job:
  
 * This will delete corrupted Social Security Numbers (SSNs) in the
   INCOME PERSON file (#408.13). The routine traverses all records (IENs)
   in the file and if the Social Security Number (#.09) field is a single
   "space" character or the letter "P" preceded by a single "space" 
   character, the field is set to NULL. The IENs are stored in the ^XTMP 
   global.
  
 * All SSN cross-references for the record are removed.  
  
 * The Patient records (DFNs) associated with each record is determined and
   stored in the ^XTMP global.
  
 * Should this patch be re-installed, the background job will not be 
   submitted and the ^XTMP global from the original installation will not
   be removed.
  
  
 NOTE: Because of the length of time this process may run to delete 
 the corrupted SSNs from the INCOME PERSON file (#408.13), which could be 
 several hours, this post-install routine is queued to run in the 
 background. Upon successful completion of the job a Mailman message is 
 sent to the Patch installer.  This message will contain statistics of the 
 job including start and end times as well as the number of records 
 affected.  The list of IENs that were corrected and associated DFNs is
 captured in the ^XTMP global.  The Mailman message will include
 information on where to view those lists. See an example of  
 the message in the 'Post-Installation Instructions' section. 
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 It is recommended to install this patch during non-peak hours and before
 the IVM BACKGROUND JOB [IVM BACKGROUND JOB] has run. This patch should NOT

 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------
 In the event a site determines that this patch should be backed out, the 
 site should submit a YOUR IT Services ticket with the Enterprise Service
 Desk (ESD) for assistance with the procedure.
  
 IMPORTANT NOTE: System usage cannot be restored by performing a restore 
 from the back-up of the INCOME PERSON file (#408.13) because it would 
 re-introduce corrupted data. Installation of follow-on patch IVM*2.0*174 
 (which will not introduce new functionality but will complete the clean 
 up of the corrupted data) is required.
