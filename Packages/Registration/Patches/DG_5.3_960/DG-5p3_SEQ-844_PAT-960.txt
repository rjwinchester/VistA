Description:
============

 The Mental Health Suicide Prevention - Suicide High Risk Patient 
 Enhancements (SHRPE) effort incorporates enhancements that will 
 Modify the VistA registration (DG namespace). The scope of these 
 enhancements will include:
  
 ASSIGNMENT ACTION NOT LINKED REPORT (NLR)
 There are three new prompts for the user to filter the report findings:
    1. If Category I or Category II is selected then there will be a prompt
       to select an individual flag if desired.
    2. Prompt for active assignments only, inactive, or both.
    3. Prompt for type of History Actions: actions generated by the local
       facility, actions generated by other facilities, or both.
  
 FLAG ASSIGNMENT REPORT (FAR)
 The report now requires 132 columns to display the data for each record.  
 If you wish to run the report to your terminal (PC) and you do not know 
 how to place your terminal in 132 column mode, then your local IT staff 
 should be able to assist you.
  
 New report filters on each Assignment:
    1. Choose Assignments whose OWNER SITE is the local facility,
       another facility, or either.
    2. Choose Assignments whose current status is active or inactive.
  
 Report layout:
    1. New column headers.
    2. Orig AssignDT - This is the date that the assignment was first made.
    3. Last AssignDT - This is the date of the last action that activated
                       the assignment within the user selected date range.
    4. # Days Active - This is the total number of days since the last
                       activation that this assignment was active.  If the
                       assignment was still active at the end of the user
                       input date range, then the number of days active
                       calculates up to the report end date.
    5. Review On -     If the assignment is currently active, this is next
                       date for review.
    6. Overdue? -      For active assignment this will be yes or no.
                       For inactive assignments this will be N/A.
    7. # Times Activated - This is the total number of actions within
                           the date range that are considered an
                           activation type action.
    8. Current Owning Site - This is the value of the OWNER SITE field
                             in the PRF Assignment file (#26.13).
    9. For a single flag assignment to show in this report, there must be
       at least one History record recorded within the report date range.
  
 RECORD FLAG TRANSMISSION ERRORS (TE)
 This ListManager option had additional filters added to determine which 
 transmission errors to display:
    1. The Assignment must currently be active.
    2. The OWNER SITE value for an assignment must be a division of the
       local facility.
  
 There is a new user prompt asking whether to run the report for all flags 
 or an individual flag.

 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------------
 The Back-Out Procedure consists of restoring routines. 
 The back-out is to be performed by persons with programmer-level access,
 and in conjunction with the SHRPE Team.
  
 The pre-patch versions of routines can be restored by using backup 
 MailMan message that should be created during installation.
  
 Note: The routines can be modified by another patch that follows the 
 DG*5.3*960 and released after the installation of the DG*5.3*960. In this
 case restoring routines from the backup MailMan messages might cause 
 issues. It is recommended that the sites contact the development team and
 the National VistA Support team after for specific solutions to their
 unique problems.
