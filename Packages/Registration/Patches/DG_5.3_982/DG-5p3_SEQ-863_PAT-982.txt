Description:
============

 Patch DG*5.3*982 is being released to support the enhancements for the
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 project.
  
 Patch DG*5.3*982 is also being released in support of the Enrollment
 System (ES) 5.7 release. Refer to Informational Patch EAS*1*180
 (Enrollment Application System) for additional details regarding the ES
 release.
  
 ==========================================================================
 IMPORTANT NOTE:
 ==========================================================================
 Deployment of patch DG*5.3*982 will be conducted using a phased approach. 
 Facilities not involved in the New Enrollee Appointment Request 
 Scheduling Standardization Initiative (NEAR-SSI) pilot should not install 
 the DG*5.3*982 patch until the second wave of deployment in January 2020. 
 Once the patch is installed, automatic removal from the NEAR is limited 
 to primary care encounters and appointments scheduled in a primary care 
 stop code. Training will be offered prior to the January 2020 nationwide 
 deployment. For those sites not participating in the pilot project,
 additional DG namespace patches may be released in the intervening period
 between phase 1 and phase 2 of the pilot project. Instructions will be
 provided as to if those patches are approved to install out of sequence. 
  
 Installation by a facility not involved with the NEAR-SSI pilot prior to 
 January 2020 poses a risk to the accuracy and quality of the NEAR list 
 data. Once the patch is installed, specialty care appointments will now 
 remain on the NEAR list, and users will not have received training and 
 education to manually disposition select specialty care appointments. This
 will result in inaccurate reporting and mismanagement of the NEAR list.
 This risk can be mitigated by a site that inadvertently installs the patch
 prior to January 2020 by following the instructions below:
  
 Patch DG*5.3*982 Primary Care Appointments, NEAR List Processing, 
 modifies the Call List option and New Enrollee Appointment Request 
 Tracking Report to indicate the New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) 
 request as "filled" when a primary care appointment is scheduled, or an 
 encounter is completed in a clinic with a primary care stop code. Once 
 the appointment is scheduled, or the encounter completed, the entry is 
 automatically removed from the list and NEAR report. Scheduled 
 appointments and completed encounters in stop codes other than the 
 designated primary stop codes will no longer auto disposition as "filled" 
 and be removed from the NEAR list. Staff will be required to manually 
 disposition the NEAR in the VistA NEAR Management Menu using the 
 Management Edit option change the status to "cancelled" in order to 
 remove it from the list and NEAR reports.
  
 NEAR list entries manually dispositioned due to an appointment scheduled 
 in a stop code other than primary care are dispositioned as "cancelled".
 Staff will enter one of the following notations in the appointment request

 The remaining sites should install this patch starting January 13, 2020 
 with a regular compliance of 30 days (02/12/2020). 
  
 This patch will modify the New Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) list 
 so that Veterans will only be removed from the NEAR list if a Primary 
 Care Appointment type is scheduled for the Veteran. All other scheduled 
 appointment types will not impact the NEAR list. This will help ensure 
 that a Primary Care Appointment is scheduled for the Veteran in a timely 
 manner. Additionally, the NEAR List Tracking report will better reflect 
 the current scheduling status for the Veterans on the report.
 ==========================================================================
  
 Currently, in Veterans Health Information System and Technology 
 Architecture (VistA) Registration, Eligibility & Enrollment (REE), the 
 Call List option [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1] displays newly enrolled Veterans 
 who applied for VA Healthcare and indicated they want an appointment with 
 a VA health care provider. VistA users can use the New Enrollee 
 Appointment Request (NEAR) Call List (generated by the Call List option 
 [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1]) to view newly enrolled Veterans waiting to have 
 appointments scheduled. This list is sometimes referred to as the local 
 NEAR list, or local NEAR Call List. A patient remains on the local NEAR 
 Call List until any appointment is scheduled for the patient.
  
 With patch DG*5.3*982, the Call List option [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1] is
 modified to include a Veteran on the local NEAR Call List until they have
 been scheduled for a Primary Care Appointment. The Tracking Report option 
 [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT2] is modified so that only Primary Care Appointments 
 will populate the SCHEDULED APPT DATE column of the Tracking Report.
  
 An appointment or encounter is considered a Primary Care Appointment only
 when the clinic is configured with primary and secondary position stop
 codes as one of the combinations listed below. This portion of the clinic
 configuration is in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) STOP CODE NUMBER
 field (#8) and the CREDIT STOP CODE field (#2503).

    install.
  
 2. The following options should be disabled during installation:
     
    Management Edit                   [DGEN NEACL REQUEST MGT EDIT]
    Call List (background job)        [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1BK]
    Call List                         [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1]
    Tracking Report                   [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT2] 
  
 3. If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the 
    following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their 
    descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the
    installation. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
   
    Appointment Management             [SDAM APPT MGT]
  
 4. This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 Reschedule the Call List (background job) [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1BK] if it
 was unscheduled.
  
  
 Back-Out/Roll Back Plan:
 ------------------------
 In the event a site determines that this patch should be backed out, the 
 site should submit a YOUR IT Services ticket with the Enterprise Service 
 Desk (ESD) for assistance with the procedure.
  
 Any issues would need to be evaluated to determine if: a back-out of the 
 software is appropriate; a new patch is needed; or if data requires 
 correction or restoration.
   
 During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as
 directed, "Backup a Transport Global", then routines will have the 
 ability to be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was 
 generated. However, the KIDS installation process does not perform a
 backup of other VistA software components, such as DD, cross-reference,
 and template changes.
