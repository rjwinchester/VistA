Subject: RESOLVE UNDEFINED ERROR IN PATIENT MOVEMENT & ANNUAL INCOME MULTIPLIER

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following:
  
 - Resolves an <UNDEFINED> error which occurs when the DGPMDDCN routine is 
 invoked from the 'APR' mumps cross reference associated with the PRIMARY 
 PHYSICIAN (#.08) field of the PATIENT MOVEMENT (#405) file. 
  
 - Updates the input transform and executable help text for the ALL OTHER INCOME
   (#.17) field in the INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL INCOME (#408.21) file.  The input 
   transform now allows the user to append a '*' to calculate an annual total.
   The executable help text will reflect this functionality.
  
 NOTE: This patch has been developed together with patch EAS*1*110 and they
       will be released as a distribution file DG_53_P812.KID.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC0000000342968 - Undefined error (DG*5.3*671 code change?)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In the DGPMDDCN routine, there was a case where it proceeds without first 
 setting the variable DGFLD before calling the KILL tag. This ends up 
 resulting in an undefined error: <UNDEFINED>E+1^DIE1.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A MUMPS cross-reference on the PRIMARY PHYSICIAN field (#.08) of the PATIENT
 MOVEMENT (#405) file is calling the DGPMDDCN routine to update the
 PROVIDER (#.104) field in the PATIENT (#2) file. The update code is also
 calling ^DIE. This second FileMan call of ^DIE within ^DIE is causing the
 reported error. The call will be replaced with the database server call
 UPDATE^DIE.
  
 2. INC0000000315498  LTC Copay test no longer calculated yearly total
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When financial information is entered for a patient on the Current 
 Calendar Year Gross Income Screen <5>, the annual amount does not 
 automatically calculate from the monthly amount when an asterisk is
 appended to the value of the ALL OTHER INCOME (#.17) field in the
 INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL INCOME (#408.21) file, as the help text indicates it
 should.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The input transform will be modified to provide the functionality of
 multiplying a monthly amount into an annual amount when a "*" is added. The
 executable help will also be updated to reflect this functionality.
  
 The post install routine DG812P is included to compile all Input/Print 
 templates linked to the modified field.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch may be installed during normal working hours with all users on
 the system. However, as it is necessary to disable some menu options when
 installing this patch it is recommended that the install be done during
 non-peak hours. (Installing during peak hours may result in an unusually
 long install time.)
  
 Install Time - less than 2 minutes.
  
 NOTE: This patch has been developed together with patch EAS*1*110 and they
       will be released as a distribution file DG_53_P812.KID.
       Installing DG*5.3*812 will also install EAS*1.0*110.
  
  
 1.  Retrieve the KIDS distribution host file. This patch is
     distributed in a host file due to the amount of data contained in
     the patch.  The name of the host file is:
  
          DG_53_P812.KID
  
      Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.
      The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
           download.vista.domain.ext
  
      This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
      server as follows:
  
           Albany                  ftp.domain.ext
           Hines                   ftp.domain.ext
           Salt Lake City          ftp.domain.ext
