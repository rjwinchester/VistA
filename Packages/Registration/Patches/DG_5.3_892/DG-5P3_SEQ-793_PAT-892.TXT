  Remedy Overview:
  ================
  1.)  Undefined error when entering Confidential Address   
  
  Problem:
  --------
  An undefined error occurs in Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA
  option when entering a Confidential Address if the city field is greater
  than fifteen characters in length and no ZIP Code was previously entered.
     
  Resolution:
  -----------
  When the length of a city is more than 15 characters, a CITY ABBREVIATION 
  lookup is done.  ZIP Code is needed for this lookup.  Resolution is to
  skip the CITY ABBREVIATION check in routine ^DGREGTZL if ZIP Code was
  omitted. The city would instead be truncated to a length of 15 characters.
  
  
  2.)  PRF Assignment Action Not Linked Report issue
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Patient Record Flags (PRF) can be transferred between sites.  When 
  transferred, all related actions are also transferred.  All actions must be
  linked to a TIU (Text Integration Utility) document.  The Assignment Action
  Not Linked Report lists actions that are not linked to a TIU document.
  The problem is that TIU documents are NOT transferred between sites, by
  design.  Sites do not want to see transferred actions on this report.
     
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Modify routine ^DGPFRAL1 to check for a change of flag assignment.  If the
  flag was transferred, do not report missing TIU link for actions prior to 
  the transfer date.
    
  
  3.)  Documentation change needed for MISSING PATIENT PRF
   
  Problem:
  --------
  When patch DG*5.3*869 was released, a new Patient Record Flag (MISSING 
  PATIENT) was added to the PRF NATIONAL FLAG (#26.15)file.  Documentation
  and training related to this patch were presented with the below
  information:
  
  Creates a new mail group, DGPF MISSING PT FLAG REVIEW. Members of this mail 
  group will be notified via a Mailman message when a patient has been assigned 
  the National, Category I - MISSING PATIENT PRF.
  
  This information is incorrect and needs to be updated in documentation on the 
  VDL website.
    
  Resolution:
  -----------
  The following documents should be updated with the correct information:
