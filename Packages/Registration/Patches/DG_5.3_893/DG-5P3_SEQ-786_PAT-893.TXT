Subject: REBUILD AEAR INDEX, BUG FIX IN CALL LIST AND TRACKING RPT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch DG*5.3*893 addresses three issues with the New Enrollee Appointment 
 Request (NEAR) management reports, which tracks the appointment requests 
 made by new applicants.
  
 1). The AEAR index is missing for some patients that have the APPOINTMENT
     REQUEST ON 1010EZ set to Yes.
 2). There is an issue with the Call List [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1] when 
     comparing a patient's preferred facility to the selected facility.
 3). The Tracking Report [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT2] has a bug which causes
     the Application Programming Interface (API) that gathers 
     appointments to only return one appointment.

 Remedy Overview:
 =================
  
 1. INC0000001006932    How does DGEN NEACL MGT RPT2 pull pts?
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The expected results are not being obtained when running the Call List
    [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1] and the Tracking Report [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT].
    Several VistA issues were discovered.
  
    1). Patients whose first enrollment was before the install date of 
        patch DG*5.3*779 do not have an AEAR index on the APPOINTMENT
        REQUEST ON 1010EZ (#1010.159) field in the PATIENT (#2) file.
        This issue can cause patients not to show on the Call List report.
  
    2). The Call List [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1] lists veterans who requested 
        an appointment during enrollment and do not have an appointment
        scheduled yet. There is an issue with the Call List [DGEN NEACL
        MGT RPT1] when comparing a patient's preferred facility to the 
        selected facility. It causes them not to match if the preferred 
        facility code begins with four numerical values instead of three 
        and this can cause patients not to show on the Call List report.
  
    3). The Tracking Report [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT2] lists times between the 
        enrollment date of a veteran requesting an appointment on the
        1010EZ form and the date the appointment was actually made. 
        However, there is an issue with the Tracking Report [DGEN NEACL
        MGT RPT2], which causes the API that gathers appointments to 
        only return one appointment. This can cause a blank appointment 
        date to display if the first appointment is a non-count. 
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch rebuilds the AEAR index for patients that are missing it. 
 It also modifies routine DGENACL2 to compare only the 1st three 
 digits of the preferred facility to the selected facility when
 determining whether to include the patient on the Call List. In
 addition, it also modifies routine DGENACL2 to properly call the API
 and review all appointments for the Tracking Report.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours.
   
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes. Suggested time to install:
 during non-peak requirement hours.            
   
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
    2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
       the Installation menu.
   
    3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options (when
       prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*893).      
  
        a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch is
           installed.
        c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
           the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
        d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
           the components of the KIDS build.
      
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*893
   
    5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during install ? NO//"
       respond No.
  
    6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
       and Protocols? YES//" respond Yes.
  
       When prompted, 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of 
       Order':', enter:
              
           Call List                           [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1]
         
           Tracking Report                     [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT2]
  
       When prompted, 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of
       Order':', press enter.
  
    7. In the last part of the install the following will display and a job
       will be tasked:
       This process will find all entries in the PATIENT file (#2) that
       have field APPOINTMENT REQUEST ON 1010EZ (#1010.159) set to Y
       and do not have an AEAR index for that field. The process will
       set the index.
  
       The clean up process will perform the following steps in order:
            1) Search/update the patient data.  (This step looks at 
               every patient in the PATIENT (#2) file.)  A summary
               MailMan message will be sent to the user when the
               search/update is complete.
            2) The user will need run D EP^DG53P893 from the programmer
               prompt to view the detailed report within 90 days.
               NOTE: The system will purge the process log after 90
               days!
  
      Log data will be stored in the ^XTMP("DG53P893") global.
  
      TaskMan Task: NNNNNNN
  
  
      ****DO NOT DELETE THE ROUTINE DG53P893 after the install. You will
          need to keep it around for as long as you would like to be able
          to view the log data for the clean up process (up to 90 days)
