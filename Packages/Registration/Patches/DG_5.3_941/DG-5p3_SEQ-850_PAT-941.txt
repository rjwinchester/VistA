 ************************ A T T E N T I O N **************************
    After installing this patch, please ensure that you follow the
    Residential Address VistA Parameters Special Instructions under the
    Post-Installation section of this patch description. Failure to take   
    this action immediately after install will result in failure to upload
    the demographic updates from the Z05 messages.
 **********************************************************************
  
 Patch DG*5.3*941 is being released to support the enhancements for the
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on 
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) project, which 
 supports Enrollment System Community Care (ESCC).
  
 DG*5.3*941 is being released with IVM*2.0*164 and EAS*1.0*151 in 
 Host File DG_53_P941.KID.
  
 DG*5.3*941 is also being released in support of the Enrollment System (ES)
 5.2 release. Refer to Informational Patch EAS*1.0*159 (Enrollment
 Application System) for additional details regarding the ES release.
  
 With the install of this patch:
 A new address type of Residential Address can be viewed, added or updated
 in Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 Registration, Eligibility, & Enrollment (REE).  This address is used by
 Enrollment and Eligibility to retain the geographic residence of an
 applicant or patient. It supports the Enrollment System Community Care 
 (ESCC) program's need to determine geographic distance from a treatment
 facility.  A Residential Address street address cannot include a P.O.
 Box. A new field "Coding Accuracy Support System (CASS) Certified" was
 added to all address types to store whether postal addresses meet United
 States Postal Service (USPS) format standards. The CASS Certified field
 will not be displayed or shared in Address Application Program Interfaces
 (APIs). The Residential Address is available for viewing in other VistA
 packages via Integration Control Registration (ICR) 2041 and 10037. This
 patch also includes a Health Benefit Plan name change. This is described
 in the Pre/Post Installation Overview section below.
  
 VistA can receive from the Enrollment System a new value for the Change 
 Source associated with the Residential Address, Permanent Address, 
 Residential Phone Number, Cellular Phone Number and Email Address.  The 
 new value is "VET360" and VistA will accept and store it in the 
 corresponding PATIENT file (#2) field.  The value of "VET360" refers to a
 central repository for patient contact information which is also used for
 address validation.
  
 A defect was resolved by revising address type labels on the Patient
 Address Update [DG ADDRESS UPDATE] Option to be consistent with the
 changes made with Patch DG*5.3*925.
  
 Listing of Updates:
 ===================

    b. Phone Number [WORK] - Optional. Free Text 4-20 characters.

 PART 2:  Determine Non-Residential Address
 ==========================================
  
 1. VistA prevents a user from saving a Residential Address that is in
    a non-residential format with General Delivery or P.O. Box. A
    non-residential address is defined as Address Line 1 starting with any
    of the following in upper case, lower case or mixed case, with or 
    without a period:
  
          "Post Office"
          "P.O." or "PO" 
          "General Delivery" 
          "Box" when immediately followed by a number.
  
 2. The user can enter a non-residential address format when:
    
    a.  The Veteran's Residential address is Alaska or Hawaii
    b.  The Veteran resides in one of the United States territories (Guam, 
        American Samoa, CNMI (Mariana Islands), U.S. Virgin Islands, or
        Philippines)

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 The post install process will run routine DG53P941 to change the name of
 Health Benefit Plan (HBP) "Veteran Plan - VC Unusual and Excessive Burden"
 to "Veteran Plan - VC Unusual or Excessive Burden." in the HEALTH BENEFIT
 PLAN file (#25.11).  The routine will first check to see if this plan
 exists. If the plan does not exist, VistA will issue a message that it
 does not exist and no action is taken. If the plan does exist, the name
 change will be stored and a message will display that the plan was
 corrected in the HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN file (#25.11).
  
 The post install process will also run routine IVM2164P to add new entries
 listed in Post-Install Instructions section to the Income Verification 
 Match (IVM) DEMOGRAPHIC UPLOAD FIELDS file (#301.92).  If an entry already
 exists, it will be deleted and recreated with new data elements.
  
 Note: After installing this patch, please ensure that you follow the 
 Residential Address VistA Parameters Special Instructions under the 
 Post-Installation section of this patch description. Failure to take this 
 action immediately after install will result in failure to upload the 
 demographic updates from the Z05 messages.

 by authorized staff.
  
 Once the DG*5.3*971 build is installed at a facility, each site must 
 contact Once the host file is installed in the Production, each site must 
 contact Geraldine Bridges, Member Services, Quality Program Management 
 Program Analyst (geraldine.bridges@domain.ext) to add the site id to the 
 parameter to allow ES to share the Residential Address with their site. 
 For additional questions, log a Service Now ticket or reach out to the 
 Enterprise Service Desk at 855-673-4357, option 5. 
  
 Failure to take this action immediately after install can result in 
 failure to upload the demographic updates from the Enrollment System via 
 the ORUZ05 transmission type.
