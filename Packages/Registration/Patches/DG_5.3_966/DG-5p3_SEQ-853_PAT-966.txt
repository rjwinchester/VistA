Description:
============

 Patch DG*5.3*966 is being released to support enhancements introduced in 
 the Enrollment System (ES) 5.4 release.  For additional information on 
 the v5.4 release, please refer to informational patch EAS*1.0*169 for 
 details.  This patch provides enhancements to Veterans Health Information 
 System and Technology Architecture (VistA) Registration, Eligibility & 
 Enrollment (REE) that ensure a Veteran's complete and accurate military 
 service record is displayed in the system.
  
 This patch provides for validation of the Early Separation Reason for a 
 veterans' Military Service Episode (MSE).  This ensures greater data 
 integrity.  DG*5.3*966 ensures that eligibility for care is accurately 
 determined across Veterans Health Administration (VHA) systems and that 
 the Veteran's military service information is accurate and accessible at 
 any VHA facility.
  
 Listing of Updates
 ==================
 This patch makes the following enhancements to VistA REE:
 1. The SEPARATION REASON CODE (#.1) sub-field within the MILITARY SERVICE
    EPISODE (#.3216) multiple in the PATIENT (#2) file is added. This
    field is a pointer to the SEPARATION REASON (#26) file and the data for
    this field will be received from ES in ORF-Z11/ORU-Z11 HL7 messages in
    the ZMH segment. The SEPARATION REASON CODE cannot be edited or deleted
    by VistA users and will not be sent back to ES in a Z07 message.
  
    Note: DBIA 5783 MILITARY SERVICE EPISODE API, the routine DGMSEUTL
    includes component GETMSE that returns all records in the MILITARY 
    SERVICE EPISODE (#.3216) multiple within the PATIENT (#2) file in the
    Military Service Episode (MSE) array. While no modifications were made
    to this component, the SEPARATION REASON CODE (#.1) field is included
    in the returned array.
  
  
 2. The SEPARATION REASON (#26) file is added to VistA REE. This file
    contains the codes and associated descriptions for the Reason for Early
    Separation with data matching the equivalent table in (ES). The data
    for this file is included in the build. (See the Post-Installation
    Instructions section below.) The file consists of two fields:
    a.  CODE field (#.01) - Free-text field of 3 digits for the Reason for
        Separation Code.
    b.  DESCRIPTION field (#.02) - Free-text field of 3-128 characters.
  
 3. The HL7 interface with ES is modified to include the additional
    "SEPARATION REASON CODE" (#.01) field that is associated with each MSE.
    The ORU-Z11/ORF-Z11 message contains a new sequence, (#10), in the
    ZMH segment.
  
 4. When VistA receives an HL7 message with a Separation Reason Code, the 
    code is validated against the SEPARATION REASON (#26) file in VistA.  
    VistA processes the field based on the following criteria:
    a. If the Separation Reason Code is present in the SEPARATION REASON
       (#26) file, it is stored in the SEPARATION REASON CODE (#.1) field
       within the MILITARY SERVICE EPISODE (#.3216) multiple within the
       PATIENT (#2) file.
    b. If the Separation Reason Code is not present in the SEPARATION
       REASON (#26) file, the text "Refer to Enrollment System for Reason"
       is stored in the patient record in the REASON FOR EARLY SEPARATION
       (#.09) field in the MILITARY SERVICE EPISODE (#.3216) multiple
       within the PATIENT (#2) file.
  
 5. MSEs that contain a SEPARATION REASON CODE will not be included 
    in the ORU-Z07 or ORF-Z07 messages sent to ES.
  
 6. There are no display changes in VistA REE. The internal logic used to
    retrieve the Reason for Early Separation description from the patient
    record for display on screens <6> and <6.1> is modified as follows:
    a. If the SEPARATION REASON CODE (#.1) sub-field within the MILITARY 
       SERVICE EPISODE (#.3216) multiple in the PATIENT (#2) file is
       present, it is used to acquire the DESCRIPTION (#.02) field from the
       SEPARATION REASON (#26) file.
    b. If the SEPARATION REASON CODE (#.1) sub-field within the MILITARY 
       SERVICE EPISODE (#.3216) multiple in the PATIENT (#2) file is not
       present, the REASON FOR EARLY SEPARATION (#.09) sub-field within the
       MILITARY SERVICE EPISODE (#.3216) multiple in the PATIENT (#2) file
       field is used to retrieve the description.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 This patch should NOT be installed while the IVM BACKGROUND JOB [IVM 
 BACKGROUND JOB] is running.
  
 1. The IVM BACKGROUND JOB [IVM BACKGROUND JOB] should be unscheduled.
    Use the Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM SCHEDULE] option on the 
    Taskman Management [XUTM MGR] menu. Note the currently scheduled 
    date/time.
  
 2. The Health Level Seven (HL7) incoming/outgoing filers should be 
    stopped. Stop All Messaging Background Processes by using the [HL STOP
    ALL] option on the Filer and Link Management Options [HL MENU FILER
    LINK MGT] menu on the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU].
  
 3. Use Global Output Function to backup MILITARY SERVICE EPISODE 
    (#.3216) multiple data dictionary by running the command below (be
    sure to enter "V" for the parameters). You will need to specify a local
    directory and file name for the Device.
  
 DEVISC1A1:DEVVOO>D ^%GOGEN
  
 Device: USER$:[VISTA]dg_53_966_backup.gbl
 Parameters? ("V") => V
 Global ^DD(2.3216 -- NOTE: translation in effect
 Global ^
 DEVISC1A2:DEVVOO>
  
 If the system you are installing this patch on is a LINUX system, you will
 need to run a different utility, GOGEN^%ZSPECIAL. Enter the following 
 command:
  
 D GOGEN^%ZSPECIAL
 Device: /srv/vista/xxx/user/sftp/dg_53_966_backup.gbl
 Parameters? ("V") => V
 Global ^DD(2.3216 -- NOTE: translation in effect
 Global ^
 DEVISC1A2:DEVVOO>
  
 where "xxx" is the site designation, then follow the instructions above
 for entering the globals to save.
  
 4. The following options should be disabled during installation:
  
    Load/Edit Patient Data                [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
    Register a Patient                    [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
    View Registration Data                [DG REGISTRATION VIEW]
    Eligibility Verification              [DG ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION]
    Preregister a Patient                 [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]
    Admit a Patient                       [DG ADMIT PATIENT]
  
 5. This patch may be installed with users on the system, however, because
    the Registration options need to be placed out of order, we suggest it
    be installed after business hours. This patch should take less than 5 
    minutes to install.

 Back-Out Plan
 -------------
 During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as 
 directed, "Backup a Transport Global", then routines will have the 
 ability to be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was 
 generated. However, the KIDS installation process does not perform a 
 restore of other VistA components, such as data dictionary, 
 cross-reference, and template changes, etc. 
  
 Prior to attempting a back-out of the software, submit a YOUR IT Services 
 ticket with the Enterprise Service Desk (ESD) for assistance with the 
 procedure. 
  
 For VistA patches, the general strategy for back-out is to repair the 
 code with another follow-on patch. Depending on each individual patch, 
 sites will be given a procedure detailing how to complete the back-out.
  
 If any issue(s) with the software are discovered after it is nationally 
 released and if within the maintenance window, the ESM Phase 2 
 development team will research the issue(s) and provide guidance for any 
 immediate, possible work around. After discussing the defect with the VA 
 and receiving their approval on the desired resolution, the ESM Phase 2 
 development team will communicate guidance for the long-term solution to 
 the field.
  
 Long-term solutions will be one of the following: installation of a 
 follow-up patch to correct the defect, a follow-up patch to remove the 
 defective updates, or a procedure detailing how the software can be 
 safely backed out of the production system.
