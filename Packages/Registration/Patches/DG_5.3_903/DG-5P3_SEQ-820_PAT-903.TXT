Description:
============

 This patch addresses NSR # 20150314 - Increase Engagement in My 
 HealtheVet - MHV.  The Preregister a Patient [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION] 
 option is enhanced to increase patient engagement in the My HealtheVet 
 initiative.  The Increase Engagement in My HealtheVet (MHV) software was 
 born from the Veterans Administration (VA) Innovation Program. Prospective
 projects are scrutinized for benefit, funding, and development through
 this initiative.
  
 The My HealtheVet (MHV) web portal is a vastly under-utilized resource. As
 a result, patients are left with long wait times when trying to reach VHA
 to determine appointment date/times, refill prescriptions, or talk with a 
 healthcare provider.  All of these problems are easily mitigated with 
 registration into the MHV web portal. There is currently no consistent 
 process by which veterans are engaged about their desire to register in 
 MHV or what their MHV status is.  Pre-registration of patients is the one 
 standardized process performed across VHA.  To streamline the education of
 patients on MHV, VA requires a prompt in the VistA pre-registration screen
 indicating the Veterans' desire to participate in the MHV program, as well
 as their current MHV status.
  
 My HealtheVet Engagement/Registration Alert/Reminder
 ----------------------------------------------------
 The Preregister a Patient [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION] option is enhanced 
 to (1) display a message alerting the clerk that the selected patient has 
 not completed My HealtheVet registration and (2) allows the patient's 
 desire to be excluded from My HealtheVet to be documented.
  
 My HealtheVet Engagement Actions
 --------------------------------
 The Preregister a Patient [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION] option has been
 enhanced to allow Pre-Registration clerks to capture a patient's My
 HealtheVet registration status and actions performed to assist with a
 patient's My HealtheVet registration.
  
 Disable/Enable My HealtheVet Registration Actions
 -----------------------------------------------
 This functionality will automatically be turned off during the post 
 install for this patch. When a site is ready to start using this
 functionality it can be enabled using the MAS Parameter Entry/Edit [DG
 PARAMETER ENTRY] option. After the functionality has been enabled, if for
 some reason a site determines they no longer want this functionality
 enabled, it can be disable using the same option.
  
 This can be done as follows:

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 This patch includes a post installation routine which does the following:
      1. Files new 315 INCONSISTENT DATA ELEMENTS (#38.6) file entry for
         missing MHV registration status. This check ensures a patient has
         been asked about their registration, or interest in registering,
         in My HealtheVet.
      2. Disables this functionality for all sites by setting the "Enable
         My HealtheVet Prompts?" (#1100.07) field in the MAS PARAMETER
         (#43) file to "NO".
  
 The DG903PST post installation routine will be automatically deleted as 
 part of the installation process.
