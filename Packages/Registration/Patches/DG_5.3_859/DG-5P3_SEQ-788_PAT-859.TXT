 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1)  INC000000808286          Vista Integration Alert
     INC000000828292(d)       Home Telehealth Patient Activation-
                              Other:[DGHTERR alert]
   
     Problem:
     --------
     Vista application (DG Home Telehealth) generates an email alert when
     it is missing an application acknowledgement.  The alert is not
     providing enough information for the user to research the original 
     message to resolve the error message alert. The following information
     is being displayed in the alert message:
     
     Date
     Patient(Name)
     Error Code
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified routine DGHTRTX to add additional information to display in
     the alert message. The following information will now display in the 
     alert message:
     
     Date
     Patient(Name)
     Error Code
     
     Message ID
     Activation Date
     Vendor
