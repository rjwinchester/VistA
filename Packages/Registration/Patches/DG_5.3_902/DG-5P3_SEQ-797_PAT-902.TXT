Description:
============

 DG*5.3*711, DG*5.3*863, and DG*5.3*876 are required builds for patch
 DG*5.3*902.
  
 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) enhancements are being distributed
       in three VistA namespaces: DG, RG and MPIF. DG*5.3*902 must be 
       installed before either MPIF*1.0*60 and RG*1.0*62, as the new
       ICN fields that are being exported in this patch will be 
       populated during the post install processing of the MPIF*1.0*60 
       patch. Once DG*5.3*902 has been installed, patches RG*1.0*62
       and MPIF*1.0*60 can be installed in any order.
  
 Issue #1
 Modifications were made to the Admissions, Discharges and Transfers
 (ADT) A19 Health Level Seven (HL7) message builder code in routine
 VAFCQRY to update the ZEL, ZSP and OBX message segments to include
 VETERAN (Y/N)? (#1901), TYPE (#391), PERIOD OF SERVICE (#.323) and 
 SELF IDENTIFIED GENDER (#.024) fields from the PATIENT (#2) file.
     
 Issue #2
 The following Data Dictionary changes have been made to the PATIENT
 (#2) file.
  
 Added the fields, FULL ICN (#991.1) and FULL ICN HISTORY (#991.91),
 which will contain the complete Integration Control Number (ICN) value
 (Identifier, Delimiter, Checksum and optional Encryption Scheme).
  
 A non-lookup cross-reference ("AFICN") has been created on the FULL ICN
 (#991.1) field. In addition, auditing has been enabled for both fields.
  
 Modified the Data Definition (DD) of the DATE OF DEATH LAST UPDATED
 (#.354) and LAST EDITED BY (#.355) fields to add a HELP-PROMPT.
  
 Enabled auditing and added a FIELD INDEX type cross-references (X-Ref)
 on the following fields:
  
      Field Number     Field Name                    X-Ref
      -------------------------------------------------------
      .352             DEATH ENTERED BY              AVAFC352
      .353             SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION        AVAFC353
      .354             DATE OF DEATH LAST UPDATED    AVAFC354
      .355             LAST EDITED BY                AVAFC355
  
   This new cross-references makes use of the DG FIELD MONITOR tool
   that was released in patch DG*5.3*527. This tool utilizes the VAFC
   MPIPD FIELD TRIGGER protocol, which creates an entry in the ADT/HL7
   PIVOT (#391.71) file, as well as sets the VAFCF variable to capture
   the fields that have been modified during an edit. This field will
   be included in the Health Level Seven (HL7) 2.4 messages generated
   by the MPI/PD applications. Routine VAFCTR supports this effort.
  
 The post-init routine DG902PST will create the new FIELD INDEX type
 cross-references and ensure that auditing has been enabled for these
 four fields noted above.
      
 Issue #3
 Modifications were made to routine VAFCPDAT to change the display name
 of SELF-IDENTIFIED GENDER to SELF-IDENTIFIED GENDER IDENTITY if shown 
 upon executing any of the following options: 
     
      - Patient MPI/PD Data Inquiry [RG EXCEPTION TF INQUIRY]
      - MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING]
      - Remote Patient Data Query Menu [RG REMOTE PDAT MENU]
    
 Issue #4
 Modifications were made to routine VAFCTR so that any changes to the
 DEATH ENTERED BY (#.352), SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION (#.353), DATE OF 
 DEATH LAST UPDATED (#.354) and LAST EDITED BY (#.355) fields captured
 by the AVAFC### cross-references (noted in Issue #2 above), will be 
 transmitted by a Health Level Seven (HL7) update message to the Master
 Patient Index (MPI).
     
 Issue #5
 Modifications were made to routine VAFCHIS, which maintains the 
 existing ICN HISTORY (#992) multiple (sub-file #2.0992), to now also
 update the new FULL ICN HISTORY (#991.91) multiple (sub-file #2.0991)
 in the PATIENT (#2) file. The FULL ICN HISTORY will contain the 
 complete ICN as a single field value.
         
 Issue #6
 Modifications were made to the ADT-A19 HL7 message builder code in
 routines VAFCQRY and VAFCSB to support the new Date of Death
 requirements to the MPI. DEATH ENTERED BY (#.352), SOURCE OF 
 NOTIFICATION (#.353), DATE OF DEATH LAST UPDATED (#.354) and LAST
 EDITED BY (#.355) fields from the PATIENT (#2) file will be added to
 the OBX message segment of the ADT-A19 HL7 message. Additional Date of
 Death supporting code will be exported in patches MPIF*1.0*60 and 
 RG*1.0*62.

 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 minutes 
 to install.
  
 The following OPTIONS should be disabled during installation:
        Register a Patient              [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
        Load/Edit Patient Data          [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
        Electronic 10-10EZ Processing   [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING]
        Preregister a Patient           [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]
        UPDATE BATCH JOB FOR HL7 v2.3   [VAFC BATCH UPDATE]
        MPI/PD Patient Admin Coordinator Menu   [RG ADMIN COORD MENU]
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 The HL7 incoming filers should be stopped.  Use the Monitor, Start, Stop
 Filers [HL FILER MONITOR] option on the Filer and Link Management Options
 [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu on the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU].
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch 
     number (i.e. DG*5.3*902):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
