Description:
============

 NOTE: This patch is requested to be installed prior to or on the
 compliance date, which is 3 days after its release. Patient Record Flags
 (PRF) data can get out of sync when some sites have installed the patch
 and some have not and this can potentially cause patient safety issues.
 The patch description provides instructions on how to fix the issues if
 they arise. While the shorter period of installation cannot guarantee
 there will be no issues, this approach can minimize the risk by reducing
 the chance of out-of-sync occurrences and in the case it does happen,
 there will be fewer sites that will need to fix issues manually.
  
 This patch addresses enhancements to Patient Record Flags (PRF) to 
 improve the delivery of targeted Mental Health care for individuals at 
 high risk for suicide.
  
 Enhancements to PRF reports were made to improve effective management of 
 coordination of care for high risk individuals and to include new data 
 elements introduced with this patch.
  
 1. The Disruptive Behavior Reporting System (DBRS) record numbers are now 
    recorded in the PRF FileMan files to enable a convenient reference 
    between VistA and DBRS. The patch contains the following modifications
    to support DBRS functionality:
                                  
   a) Ability to enter/edit multiple DBRS data sets on National Category 1 
      Behavioral PRF flags in VistA.
   b) Enforced format of DBRS Number field to be consistent with DBRS case 
      numbers in DBRS system.
   c) HL7 updates to pertinent messages to include DBRS data set 
      information.
   d) Implemented business rules around editing DBRS data sets and 
      tracking the author for enforcement of editing rules.
   e) New DBRS Historical Report to display historical edits made to a 
      single National Category 1 Behavioral PRF flag in VistA.
   f) New Application Programming Interface (API) GETDBRS^DGPFDBRS was
      added to the Registration (DG) application to provide access to DBRS
      data to external applications like Computerized Patient Record System
      (CPRS) for displaying DBRS data on the screen. The Integration
      Control Registration (ICR)# 6874 was introduced for this new
      interface.
  
 2. Modification to support Text Integration Utility (TIU)/CPRS Progress
    Note Properties' flag action list functionality. The new array element
    "ORIG FAC" was added to the output of the pre-existing API  
    $$GETHTIU^DGPFAPI1. The new data element contains the facility that
    created the Assignment History record. This will allow the TIU
    application to retrieve the data via RPC TIU GET PRF ACTIONS and
    display the originating facility on the Progress Note Properties' flag
    action list and sort entries by these values. Note: The respective TIU
    modification is required to make this functionality available for
    users and it will be included in the future version of CPRS. The ICR#
    4383, that covers $$GETHTIU^DGPFAPI1, was updated accordingly.
  
 3. Enhancements to PRF flags ownership transfers. The patch implements new
    functionality and makes modifications to existing code to improve the
    process of ownership transfer and eliminate issues reported by PRF
    users:
  
   a) The new ListMan action "PRF Owner Transfer Request" (FT) in the 
      Record Flag Assignment [DGPF RECORD FLAG ASSIGNMENT] menu option was 
      created to request ownership transfer of PRF assignments.
      - When a user requests ownership transfer, the division that was used
        to sign into VistA will be the new owner.
        Note: This modification addresses PRF transfer issues experienced
        by integrated sites.
      - If the assignment is active, a MailMan message will be sent to the
        current owner's mail group requesting approval.
      - If the assignment is inactive, the transfer will be done
        immediately and a MailMan message will be sent notifying the
        current owner of the change of ownership action.
      - The functionality prevents duplicate requests.
  
   b) The corresponding new menu option Record Flag Transfer Requests (TR) 
      was created to manage ownership transfer requests:
      The new menu option allows users to:
      - list requests and their statuses
      - review request details
      - approve or reject requests
      - enter a reason for transfer request and a reason for 
        approval/rejection
  
   c) The MailMan modification is sent to PRF mail group 'DGPF PRF 
      TRANSFER REQUESTS' when PRF ownership request is
      - sent 
      - received 
      - approved
      - rejected
  
   d) Both the Change Assignment Ownership (CO) and the PRF Owner Transfer
      Request (FT) actions will set the Review Date on the new owner's
      system to the default value for that flag.
  
   e) Change Assignment Ownership (CO) action is blocked from transferring 
      an Active PRF assignment if an existing request created in PRF Owner
      Transfer Request (FT) action is pending.
  
   f) New option, DGPF RECORD REFRESH is sent out as a stand alone OPTION
      not attached to any menu. It is locked with the SECURITY KEY "DGPF
      TRANSMISSIONS". This option was designed to be used by VA Tier II
      Support or at their direction. This action allows the user to
      retransmit the entire PRF record to other sites to enforce PRF flag
      synchronization across the sites where the patient is registered.
  
 4. Various enhancements and fixes related to PRF flag HL7 transmissions: 
   a) In the Assign Flag (AF) and the Edit Flag Assignment (EF) actions,
      the two word processing fields for Assignment Narrative and Edit
      Reason will require a minimum of three consecutive alpha characters.
  
   b) HL7 messages for PRF related transmission and their processing were
      updated to use external names of PRF flag instead of internal entry
      numbers (IENs). 
  
   c) PRF HL7 message processing code was updated to properly handle HL7
      delimiters entered by users in free text fields.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
  
 1. I17222368FY18 - No Category I Patient Record Flag Assignments found
  
 Problem:
 -------
    "No Category I Patient Record Flag Assignments found" is the response
    for queries made concerning existing Patient Record Flag (PRF) data and
    no PRF data is transmitted. It has been determined a PRF file entry
    having a lone associated comment consisting solely of a punctuation/
    control character is treated by PRF-HL7 processing as not-valid; and
    is treated as if there is no flag history.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
    Modify routine DGPFHLUT to transmit an HL7 message when entering a
    punctuation as a comment and store it with quotes so that it does not
    interfere with HL7 message format or integrity.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Post-installation routine DG53P951 creates a non-human user 
 "DGPRF,INTERFACE", if one does not already exist. This user account is
 used for sending various MailMan notifications and ownership transfers of
 inactive PRF flags.
  
 The installer needs to contact the site's Suicide Prevention Coordinators
 (National Category 1 High Risk for Suicide flags) and Disruptive Behavior
 Committee Chair (National Category 1 Behavioral flags) to identify the
 person who will be coordinating transfer requests notifications for PRF
 flags. That person's name should be entered at the following prompt for
 the newly created mailgroup:
     Enter the Coordinator for Mail Group 'DGPF PRF TRANSFER REQUESTS': 
  
 During installation of the patch, the "HL7 CHECK POST-INSTALLATION" 
 report will be generated and sent to: 
   - the installer,
   - POSTMASTER,
   - DGPF BEHAVIORAL FLAG REVIEW mail group,
   - IRM mail group
 to identify potential DBRS data synchronization issues.

 -------------------------
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install. However, the "HL7 CHECK POST-INSTALLATION" report 
 generation portion of the patch might take up to several hours. Therefore 
 it is designed to be run in the background (see details in the paragraph 
 below).
  
 The patch installation can be queued if necessary. 
 - If the patch installation is queued, no questions will be asked and the 
 installer will receive a separate MailMan message with the "HL7 CHECK 
 POST-INSTALLATION" report if something was found to report. A "NO REPORT 
 GENERATED" message will be emailed and displayed if nothing was found to 
 report.
 - If the patch installation is not queued then the installer will be 
 prompted to schedule a specific time when the background jobs should be 
 started. The user can also press the Enter key to accept NOW and start it 
 immediately:
    Requested Start Time: NOW//
 Later, the user (and other recipients) will receive the report as a 
 MailMan message or "NO REPORT GENERATED" message if nothing was found to 
 report.
 Note: please see more details about this report in the post-install 
 section.

 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
  
 During National Release period all VA sites will generate the "HL7 CHECK 
 POST-INSTALLATION" report that will be used to address DBRS data 
 synchronization issues across the VA that can be occur during 
 the deployment period when some sites will have DG*5.3*951 installed and
 some will not have it yet. During this period, DBRS data sent in HL7
 messages to the sites without the patch will not be able to store DBRS
 data in the database.
  
 The report will be generated at the end of the DG*5.3*951 installation
 process. The installer and other recipients of the report will receive it
 in the form of a MailMan message. The process of generating the report
 might take up to several hours; therefore, the MailMan message with the
 report can be received several hours after the time scheduled to generate
 the report. The report will identify patients for whom DBRS data was sent
 from other sites during the National Release period (for simplicity the
 report will be checking for the last 4 days in the past and this will
 cover the National Release period).
  
 The report text will list patients and sending sites that need to run the 
 "Refresh" option for their patients listed in the report. 
 The report will be sent to the following recipients:
  the installer,
  POSTMASTER,
  local Information Resources Management (IRM) "IRM" mail group, 
  local "DGPF BEHAVIORAL FLAG REVIEW" mail group.
