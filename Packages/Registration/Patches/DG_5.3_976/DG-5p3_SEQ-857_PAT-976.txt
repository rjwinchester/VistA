Description:
============

 Patch DG*5.3*976 is being released to support the enhancements for the
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 project, 
 which supports Enrollment System Community Care (ESCC).
  
 DG*5.3*976 is also being released in support of the Enrollment System 
 (ES) 5.6 release. Refer to Informational Patch EAS*1*178 (Enrollment 
 Application System) for additional details regarding the ES release.
  
 The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) MISSION Act Of 2018 (VA 
 Maintaining Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act) 
 consolidates VA's community care programs into a new Veterans Community 
 Care Program (CCP), which will help to ensure Veterans choose VA by 
 getting them the right care at the right time from the right provider. 
 Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA) 
 Registration, Eligibility, & Enrollment (REE) supports the MISSION Act by 
 accepting, processing, and storing Health Benefit Plan (HBP) changes 
 received from ES (the authoritative source). 
  
 The HBP information is in sync in the Veterans Health Administration 
 (VHA) systems when VistA accepts and processes the Health Level Seven 
 (HL7) ORF/ORU-Z11 message with the HBP field(s) from ES.
  
 Patch DG*5.3*976 adds five Health Benefit Plans to the HEALTH BENEFIT
 PLAN file (#25.11) in VistA.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 The post install process runs the post install routine DG53976P to 
 set up the five new Health Benefit Plans (HBPs) in the HEALTH BENEFIT
 PLAN file (#25.11). The routine first checks to see if these HBPs exist.
 The routine then sets up the required fields to prepare to load the HBPs
 to the file. If they do not already exist in the file, the HBPs are
 added.  During the post install process, a message is displayed regarding
 which HBPs were added and which already existed. If the HBPs already
 exist, they are updated with the data in the post install routine. The
 install process also displays this message "An Error occurred during
 updating Plan: (Health Benefit Plan) Please log Your IT Services ticket",
 if an error occurred while trying to update the HBPs.
  
 The post install routine DG53976P will be automatically deleted after the
 patch installation completes.
