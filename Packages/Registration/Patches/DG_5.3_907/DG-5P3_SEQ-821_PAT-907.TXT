Subject: ENHANCEMENTS - BIRTH SEX AND SELF-IDENTIFIED GENDER FIELDS

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 Patch DG*5.3*907 provides the enhancements to allow Veterans Health
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) to capture and
 maintain a patient's biological sex and allow for selection, saving,
 and displaying of a self-identified gender identity value.
 
 This patch modifies the VistA REE as described below: 
  
 1. The "Sex" field label was modified to "Birth Sex" in the PATIENT 
    DEMOGRAPHICS DATA, SCREEN <1>. The screen appears in the following 
    menu options:
  
   . Preregister a Patient            [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]
   . Register a Patient               [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
   . Load/Edit Patient Data           [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
   . View Registration Data           [DG REGISTRATION VIEW]
   . Eligibility Verification         [DG ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION]
   
 2. The prompt for patient "Sex" was modified to "Birth Sex" in
    the data enter/edit of the PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS DATA, SCREEN <1>.
              
 3. The "Sex" field label shall be changed to "Birth Sex" in Patient 
    Inquiry. The field label appears in the following menu options:
  
   . Patient Inquiry                  [DG PATIENT INQUIRY]
   . Patient Inquiry                  [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER PATIENT INQ]
   . Regional Office Patient Inquiry  [DVBA REG OFF PATIENT INQ]
  
 4. PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS DATA, SCREEN <1> was modified to display the   
    Self-Identified Gender Identity (SIGI) field and to allow updates. 
  
 5. The SIGI value entered in the PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, SCREEN <1>
    will be stored in the SELF IDENTIFIED GENDER (#.024) field of the
    PATIENT (#2) file. This field was added with the release of
    DG*5.3*876 on November 13, 2014.
  
 6. The SIGI value will now display on the PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS DATA,
    SCREEN <1>. The screen appears in the following menu options:
  
   . Preregister a Patient       [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]
   . Register a Patient          [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
   . Load/Edit Patient Data      [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
   . View Registration Data      [DG REGISTRATION VIEW]
   . Eligibility Verification    [DG ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION]
   
 7. The SIGI value response options are owned by Identity Management (IdM).
    The following list of acceptable response options has been provided:
  
   . Male
   . Female
   . Transmale/Transman/Female-to-Male
   . Transfemale/Transwoman/Male-to-Female
   . Other
   . Individual chooses not to answer
   
 The user has the ability to select from the IdM-supplied list only.
 Free Form or other values are not allowed.
                                                          
 KNOWN ISSUE
 ===========
 Identity Management released VistA patch DG*5.3*876 on November 13, 2014
 that created the SELF IDENTIFIED GENDER (#.024) field in the Patient File (#2)
 to store SIGI data in VistA and share the SIGI data between VistA and Master
 Veteran Index (MVI).  The field is not a required field and the only
 mechanism in Identity Management to enter the SIGI data is via FileMan.  
 MVI accepts the last value sent (including Null) from VistA.  If MVI receives
 a null as the last value sent, this causes the SIGI field value to be deleted.
 In addition, there is a current synchrony issue in the Master Veteran Index
 (MVI) that prevents sharing of the SIGI value to VistA sites.
 
 
 RESOLUTION
 ==========
 MVI will deploy a change in April 2017 to prevent the deletion of the SIGI
 value.
