Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ENHANCEMENTS - ACTIVE DUAL CONSUMER (ADC)

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 DG*5.3*950 is the only required build for patch DG*5.3*955.
  
 The following enhancement exported in this patch to incorporate the
 Active DUAL Consumer (ADC) Health Level Seven (HL7) messaging process
 that was previously implemented through the Bi-Directional Health
 Information Exchange (BHIE) in the Master Veteran Index (MVI)
 application, was requested by the MVI Architectural group. 
  
 Enhancement
 To support the changes required to incorporate the HL7 messaging process
 for ADC, routine VAFCPTAD was updated to now allow these specific record
 additions to Station 200 (AUSTIN) to flow through the Remote Procedure
 Call (RPC) [VAFC VOA ADD PATIENT]. The existing requirement in this RPC
 for ensuring that the 'preferred facility' that the record is being added
 to is a Veteran Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) has been removed when the
 record addition is being transmitted to Station 200 (AUSTIN), because it
 is NOT a VAMC.
