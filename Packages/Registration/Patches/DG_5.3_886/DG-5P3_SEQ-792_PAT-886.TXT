 Remedy Overview:
 =================
  
 1. INC0000000894678 -  Bad Address Indicator not working correctly
   
 Problem:
 --------   
 When manually changing an address, the Bad Address Indicator does not
 "automatically" get removed as per the help text. To remove the indicator 
 you must enter the "@" symbol.
    
      
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 The help text for the PATIENT file (#2) BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR field 
 (#.121) was changed to advise the user to manually remove the indicator 
 by entering the "@" symbol. The Master Patient Index Patient Demographics
 (MPI/PD) Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VISTA) Exception Handling, MPI/PD VISTA Programmer Manual, MPI/PD VISTA 
 Technical Manual and MPI/PD VISTA User Manual were updated to
 reflect the change.
   
     
 2. INC0000000899851 -   SAC Violation in Patch DG*5.3*864
    
 Problem: 
 --------
 During the testing of patch DG*5.3*864, a SAC violation was discovered.  
 There is a non-incremental lock in routine DGREG.  
     
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine DGREG to add an incremental lock, this change did not  
 affect the functionality of the current routine.
    
  
 3. INC0000000962973 -  Update ADT User manual
   
 Problem:
 --------   
 The Admission Discharge Transfer (ADT) Bed Control Menu User Manual
 is not reflecting the functionality change that was completed in
 prior patch DG*5.3*93.
  
    
 Resolution:
 -----------  
 The ADT Bed Control Menu User Manual was updated to show changes.
    
  
 4. INC0000000964483 -DRG Frequency Report not showing data correctly   
   
 Problem:
 --------   
 Currently, the DRG Frequency Report is not showing patients in all
 sections according to the DRG codes. Any code over 600 does not show
 separated in the correct Service category of the report. 
  
    
 Resolution:
 -----------  
 Modified DGPTODF1 routine to the 2008 Medicare Severity Diagnosis
 Related Group (MS-DRG) update.  This update changed the report to 
 allow numbers larger than 600 to show in the service categories.
 Added code to DGPTODF1 to prevent DIVIDE error when there  
 is only one DRG for the date range selected and it is over 600.
