 Patch Installation: 
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 This post install process will run the post install routine DG53P936 to 
 set up the six new Health Benefit Plans (HBPs) in the HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN 
 file (#25.11).  The routine will first check to see if these HBPs exist.  
 The routine will then set up the required fields to prepare to load the
 HBPs to the account.  If they do not already exist on the account, the
 HBPs will be added.  During the post install process, a message will be
 displayed regarding which HBPs were added and which already existed. If
 the HBPs already exist, no action will be taken.  The install process
 will also display this message "An Error occurred during updating Plan:
 (Health Benefit Plan) Please log CA SDM ticket", if an error occurred
 while trying to update the HBPs.
  
 The post-installation routine DG53P936 should be manually deleted
 from your system using the KERNEL option Delete Routines [XTRDEL] upon
 completion of the installation.
