 Problem:
 --------
 Appears to be a timing issue in the VAFHPIVT routine where multiple tasks 
 are trying to access/update the cross-references for the same entry at 
 nearly the same time in the ADT/HL7 PIVOT file. The MPI seeding process
 has caused this error to pop up a bit more frequently as the DOD entries
 can fire off several separate updates to the ADT/HL7 PIVOT file at once.
 Prior to using the cross-reference in question, it validates that it
 exists, but as a separate process for the same record progresses it
 deletes the cross-reference before the data (DA) can be extracted thereby
 causing the <SUBSCRIPT> error.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine VAFHPIVT has been updated to validate the data extract (DA) was 
 successful prior to using it as a subscript in a subsequent lookup to 
 avoid any potential subscript errors.
