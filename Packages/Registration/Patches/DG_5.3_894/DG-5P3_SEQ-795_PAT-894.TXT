 **************************************************************************
   Note:  This patch is being released in support of the Enrollment
          Customer Enhancements (ECE) and Enrollment System Enhancements
          (ESE) projects.
  
          DG*5.3*894 (Registration) is being released along with IVM*2*158
          (Income Verification Match) in host file DG_53_P894.KID.
   
          It is imperative that this patch be installed no later than the
          compliance date.  Your understanding and support is appreciated.
   
 **************************************************************************
  
 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending its regulation 
 concerning the manner in which VA determines that a Veteran is 
 Catastrophically Disabled (CD) for purposes of enrollment Priority Group 
 4.  The current regulation relies on specific codes from the 
 International Classification of Diseases (ICD), ICD-9-CM and Current 
 Procedural Terminology (CPT).  It has been requested to eliminate the use
 of ICD-9-CM and CPT codes when adding or updating the Veterans' CD data.  
 The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the
 Enrollment System (ES) and VistA Registration, Enrollment and Eligibility
 (VistA REE) software to support the requirements for the Catastrophic
 Disability Initiative.
  
 This patch modifies the Registration v5.3 application as described below: 
  
 1. The addition or modification to Veterans' Catastrophic Disability data
    will use the new CD DESCRIPTORS (#.01) sub-field within the CD 
    DESCRIPTORS (#.401) multiple in the PATIENT (#2) file in lieu of CD 
    STATUS DIAGNOSES, CD STATUS PROCEDURES and CD STATUS CONDITIONS and their 
    associated fields.
  
 2. The CD STATUS DIAGNOSES, CD STATUS PROCEDURES and CD STATUS 
    CONDITIONS prompts presented during data entry are replaced with a CD 
    DESCRIPTORS prompt.
  
 3. Six new CD DESCRIPTORS are added to the CATASTROPHIC DISABILITY 
    REASONS file (#27.17). They are:
  
          QUADRIPLEGIA
          PARAPLEGIA    
          PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE STATE
          LEGAL BLINDNESS
          AMPUTATION, DISARTICULATION OR DETACHMENT   
          DEFICIENCIES OF PHYSICAL OR MENTAL FUNCTION
  
 4. The Z11 HL7 Processor is enhanced to receive and file CD STATUS 
    DESCRIPTORS from ES.
  
 5. Updates to the HELP-PROMPT, DESCRIPTION, and/or UNEDITABLE 
    classification were made for the following fields in the Patient (#2) 
    file:

 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL INSTRUCTIONS
 ------------------------------------
     
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
 patch is available.
   
  The preferred method is to FTP the files from ftp://download.vista.med.va
  .gov/.  This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.
  
  Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
  server as follows: 
  
         OI&T FIELD OFFICE       FTP ADDRESS                DIRECTORY
         -----------------       -----------                ---------

         Salt Lake City     ftp.domain.ext      []
  
         The following file will be available usually within 1 - 3 days at 
         http://www.domain.ext/vdl/application.asp?appid=55:

 =================== PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ===================
  
 1.   Sites should clean up any Catastrophic Disability inconsistencies found
      prior to installation of the host file.  The FileMan below requires 132
      columns and may be sent to a printer if desired.  If the report is
      expected to be small, the user may send the report to the screen
      providing the VistA session screen is set to display  132 characters
      as needed.

      This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
      server as follows:
   
         Albany                  ftp.domain.ext
         Hines                   ftp.domain.ext
         Salt Lake City          ftp.domain.ext
   
       The DG_53_P894.KID host file is located in the 
       directory.  Use ASCII Mode when downloading the file.

       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
