 Software Retrieval:
 ===================
 The software for this patch is not being distributed through the National 
 Patch Module. This patch is being distributed as a host file. 
  
  
 File Name            Description
 ---------            -----------
 DG_53_P910.KID       Host File containing KIDS software distribution
  
  
 The host file will contain the following three KIDS builds:
  
 DG*5.3*910
 EAS*1.0*125
 IB*2.0*540
  
 Sites may retrieve the software directly using File Transfer Protocol 
 (FTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following OI Field 
 Offices:
  
                     Albany   : ftp.domain.ext
                     Hines    : ftp.domain.ext
               Salt Lake City : ftp.domain.ext
       First Available Server : download.vista.domain.ext
  
  
 Note:  Use ASCII mode when transferring the .KID file.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This host file (containing three patches) can be installed with users on
 the system.  The installation should not be queued to run.  Installation
 will take approximately 10 minutes. The updates to the GMT THRESHOLDS
 file (#712.5) in patch EAS*1.0*125, are extensive. Due to the volume of
 updates, the installation process will appear to stall and/or stop. This
 is normal, as the file updates may take up to 10 minutes to complete.
  
        *****Please be patient and allow the process to complete.*****
  
 Also, when comparing the transport global to the current system, entries 
 will scroll by on the screen.  This is normal as there are approximately
 45,551 entries included in the GMT THRESHOLDS file (#712.5) distributed
 with this patch and a comparison is done on each of these entries. It is
 possible your session may time out before the install has completed. If
 so, you may not be able to get a complete screen capture of the compare.
 This will not, however, mean that there is any problem with the software.
 To avoid a session time-out, you can designate a printer (non-queued) as
 the device for the installation.

                                    ------------------
        **This is the step to start the installation of this KIDS patch:
  
       a.  Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch install.
  
       b.  The BILLING EXEMPTIONS file (#354.1) will be checked for
           medication co-payment exemptions based on prior thresholds.
           If -- and only if -- there are exemptions, you will be prompted
           to UPDATE AND PRINT the exemptions report.  NOTE:  the report is
           not new and is intended only as an FYI for billing staff.
  
              Select Action:  (P/U): Update & Print//
  
           Press <Enter> to accept the default "Update & Print"
  
              Select Device:

           SPOOLER, or P-MESSAGE are not allowed. You MUST choose a
           valid printer or the installation will be aborted.
  
           NOTE: The exemption report contains full patient names and SSNs.
           Be sure to select a device in a secure area and retrieve the
           output immediately.
  
           You need not queue the report since the installation process
           will queue it automatically.
