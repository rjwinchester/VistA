 Overview:
  
 This patch introduces additional International Classification of Diseases,
 Tenth Revision (ICD-10) implementation-related modifications into the
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 Registration V5.3 package.  The enhancements being made support the
 existing business processes in the Admission Discharge Transfer (ADT) &
 Patient Treatment File (PTF) modules.  
  
 Scope:
  
 The Patient Treatment File (PTF) Modifications project will increase the 
 maximum allowable codes in the entry, display, lookup, view, print, 
 storage, and transmission of the ICD-10 code sets in the VistA legacy and 
 HealtheVet systems.  Effective as of the ICD-10 activation date, 
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) will be able to utilize the ICD-10
 code sets to include the increased number of diagnosis and procedures
 which can be recorded in its day-to-day operations (e.g. entry, display,
 lookup, print, storage, internal and/or external transmission) for
 inpatient episodes of care with discharges on or after this date.
  
 The ICD-10 PTF Modifications project supports the expansion of the number 
 of ICD-10 Diagnosis, Present on Admission (POA) indicators, and Procedure 
 and Surgical codes that may be contained in a patient treatment record.  
 The user will now be able to enter up to 25 ICD-10 diagnosis codes with 
 their associated POA indicators in each Movement (501) screen and in the 
 Discharge (701) screen of a patient treatment record.  The user will also 
 be able to enter up to 25 ICD-10 procedure codes in each Surgical Episode 
 (401) screen and in each Non-OR Procedure (601) screen.
  
 Functional Overview:
  
 * System enhancements and modifications are being made to the existing
   software components in the ADT & PTF modules.
  
    - The 501 transactions will allow up to 25 diagnosis codes and POA 
      indicators per patient movement.
  
    - The 401 Surgeries and 601 Procedures will allow up to 25 
      operation/procedure codes for each event.
  
    - The 701 transaction will allow one principal diagnosis with a POA
      indicator and up to 24 secondary diagnoses with POA indicators
      (data stored in 702 record) for a total of 25 diagnosis codes and
      25 POA Indicators.
  
 * Modified Options:
   This patch modifies the code for the following options to support
   the expansion of the number of ICD-10 Diagnosis, Present on Admission
   (POA) indicators, and Procedure and Surgical codes that may be contained
   in a given PTF record:
       
    - DRG Calculation [DG DRG CALCULATION]
    - Load/Edit PTF Data [DG PTF SCREEN]
    - Open Closed Census Records [DGPT CENSUS OPEN RECORD]
    - Open Released or Transmitted Census Records [DGPT CENSUS OPEN 
      RELEASED]
    - Quick Load/Edit PTF Data [DG PTF QUICK LOAD]
    - Release Closed Census Records [DGPT CENSUS RELEASE RECORD]
    - Transmit Census Records [DGPT CENSUS TRANSMIT]
    - Set Up Non-VA PTF Record [DG PTF FEE BASIS ADD]
  
 * Modified Reports: 
   This patch modifies the code for the following reports to support
   the expansion of the number of ICD-10 Diagnosis, Present on Admission
   (POA) indicators, and Procedure and Surgical codes that may be contained
   in a given PTF record:
   
    - Inquire Census Record [DGPT CENSUS INQUIRE]
    - Comprehensive Census Report [DGPT CENSUS RECORD REPORT]
    - Comprehensive Report by Admission [DG PTF COMPREHENSIVE REPORT]
    - Diagnostic Code PTF Record Search [DG PTF ICD DIAGNOSTIC SEARCH]
    - DRG Information Report [DG PTF DRG INFORMATION OUTPUT]
    - DRG Case Mix Summary [DG PTF DRG CASE MIX SUMMARY]
    - Inquire PTF Record [DG PTF COMPREHENSIVE INQUIRY]
    - Patient Summary by Admission [DG PTF SUMMARY DIAG/OP OUTPUT]
    - Surgical Code PTF Record Search [DG PTF ICD SURGICAL SEARCH]
    - Update Transfer DRGs for Current FY [DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRG'S]
    - Validity Check of PTF Record [DG PTF VALIDITY CHECK]
  
 * Delete POA Indicator when Associated Diagnosis is Deleted:
   When a user deletes an ICD-10 diagnosis code within the following PTF 
   options, its associated Present on Admission (POA) indicator is 
   automatically deleted:
  
    - Load/Edit PTF Data [DG PTF SCREEN]
    - Quick Load/Edit PTF Data [DG PTF QUICK LOAD]
    - Set Up Non-VA PTF Record [DG PTF FEE BASIS ADD]
  
   This change applies to the deletion of primary, secondary, and 501 
   movement diagnosis codes.
  
 * Prevent Population of POA if Associated Diagnosis is Not Present:
   A user will not be able to enter a POA indicator field when an 
   associated ICD-10 diagnosis code is not present within the following PTF
   options:
  
    - Load/Edit PTF Data [DG PTF SCREEN]
    - Quick Load/Edit PTF Data [DG PTF QUICK LOAD]
    - Set Up Non-VA PTF Record [DG PTF FEE BASIS ADD]
  
   This change applies to POA indicator fields associated with primary, 
   secondary, and 501 movement diagnosis codes.
  
 * Allow Duplicate ICD Codes for 401 Surgeries and 601 Procedures: 
   A user will be able to enter duplicate ICD codes for 401 Surgery and 
   601 Procedure transactions within the following options:
  
    - Load/Edit PTF Data [DG PTF SCREEN]
    - Quick Load/Edit PTF Data [DG PTF QUICK LOAD]
    - Set Up Non-VA PTF Record [DG PTF FEE BASIS ADD]
  
   NOTE: Entry of duplicate ICD codes will NOT be allowed for 701 
         Primary/Secondary Diagnosis or 501 Movement transactions.
  
 * Entry of Gender-specific ICD Codes: 
   A user will be able to enter any gender-specific ICD-10 code into a 501 
   Movement, 401 Surgery, and 601 Procedure transaction whether or not it 
   matches the patient's gender.  Within the following options, the user 
   will receive a warning message when attempting to enter a
   gender-specific ICD-10 code for a patient of the opposite gender, but
   the user will not be prevented from entering the gender-specific code:
  
    - Load/Edit PTF Data [DG PTF SCREEN]
    - Quick Load/Edit PTF Data [DG PTF QUICK LOAD]
    - Set Up Non-VA PTF Record [DG PTF FEE BASIS ADD]
  
 * PTF/Austin Information Technology Center Interface:
   System enhancements and modifications are being made to the existing
   software interface between the VistA PTF module and the Austin
   Information Technology Center (AITC).  VistA PTF collects diagnosis
   and procedure information on inpatient episodes of care and based on
   a user defined trigger event, transmits the data to the AITC for
   inclusion in the PTF Master File (Data Store). Additionally, VistA
   PTF collects census data (diagnosis/POA and procedure/surgery) 
   quarterly on current inpatients and transmits that data to the AITC. 
  
   - Modifications are being made to the content of PTF Transmission (VistA
     Mailman) messages to accommodate the inclusion of up to twenty-five
     (25) ICD-10 Diagnosis and associated Present on Admission (POA)
     indicators and up to twenty-five (25) each ICD-10 Procedure and
     Surgical codes that could be included in a record for transmission.
  
   - Modifications are being made to the delivery of the PTF Transmission 
     messages to the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC).  The 
     messages will be sent to a new queue; Q-PTI.DOMAIN.EXT.  The confirmation
     messages from the AITC will be sent to a new local mail group called 
     'PTI'.  The new 'PTI' mail group will replace the current 'PTT' mail
     group and should contain the same member recipients.
  
   - Modifications are being made to the 099 Transmission, 099 Transmission
     for Census, and Record Output (RPO) options to ensure acceptance of
     the following Mailman message transaction types when  transmitted to
     the new PTI queue at the AITC: 
  
       099 - Request to delete a PTF record at the AITC.
       150 - Request a printout for a single admission record for a 
             patient.
       151 - Request a printout for all admissions for a patient.
