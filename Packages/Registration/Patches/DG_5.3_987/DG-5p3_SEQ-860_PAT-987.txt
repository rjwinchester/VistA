Description:
============

 Patch DG*5.3*987 is being released to support the enhancements for the
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 project. 
  
 Patch DG*5.3*987 is also being released in support of the Enrollment
 System (ES) 5.8 release. Refer to Informational Patch Enrollment 
 Application System EAS*1*180 and EAS*1*181 for additional details 
 regarding the ES release.
  
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) 
 Registration, Eligibility & Enrollment (REE) patch DG*5.3*987 renames 
 Health Benefit Plans (HBPs) as Veteran Medical Benefit Plans (VMBPs) to 
 support the Electronic Health Record (EHR) in Cerner's Millennium 
 application and adds additional VMBPs to VistA. ES now automatically 
 assigns the correct VMBP(s) to a patient's record based on the patient's
 traits, such as eligibilities. ES transmits the VMBPs assigned to the
 patient to VistA REE. VMBPs associated to a patient are displayed in
 VistA, but cannot be assigned or removed from the patient's record. VistA
 Registration screens are updated to refer to the plans as either "Veteran
 Medical Benefit Plan" or "VMBP".
   
 DG*5.3*987 modifies the HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN file (#25.11) to store 21 new 
 core VMBP names, codes, and short and long descriptions. VistA will 
 accept the new plans from ES via Health Level Seven (HL7) ORF-Z11/ORU-Z11 
 messages.
  
 A new VMBP <11.3.1> screen is added to display detailed plan information. 
 VistA REE displays the VMBP <11.3.1> screen when the user selects 
 "Expand Entry" from the View History [DGEN HBP VIEW] action protocol on
 the VMBP <11.1> screen.
  
 The Patient Inquiry [DG PATIENT INQUIRY] option and Patient Inquiry 
 application program interface (API) (DGRPD) is updated to display 
 "Veteran Medical Benefit Plan" instead of "Health Benefit Plan". The API 
 DGRPD is called from VistA REE menu options, subscribers to API DGRPD, 
 and other VistA packages.
  
 Integration Control Registration (ICR) 10037 (DGRPD) is updated to display
 "Veteran Medical Benefit Plan" instead of "Health Benefit Plan". 
 ICR 10037      NAME: DGRPD
   CUSTODIAL PACKAGE: REGISTRATION
 SUBSCRIBING PACKAGE: 
               USAGE: Supported
  
 The DG*5.3*987 patch adds a new INACTIVE (#.06) field to the HEALTH 
 BENEFIT PLAN (#25.11) file to allow HBPs to be inactivated in VistA REE. 
 When the INACTIVE (#.06) field is set to YES, then the plan will not be 
 displayed when the user selects the View All HBP Detail [DGEN HBP DETAIL] 
 action protocol to display the HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN <11.4> screen in VistA 
 REE Registration options.   
  
 The Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside 
 Networks (MISSION) Act enactment on June 6, 2019 recalculated Veteran's
 Community Care VMBPs in ES and transmitted the HL7 ORF-Z11/ORU-Z11
 messages to VistA. If the message did not transmit successfully, an
 inactive Veterans Choice plan may display on screens that should display
 the current VMBP of the Veteran. Plan names preceded by "zz" indicate that
 the plan is inactive. If an inactive plan is displayed, the user may send
 an eligibility query by using the SQ Send Query [DGEN SEND ENROLLMENT
 QUERY] action protocol located in the Patient Enrollment [DGEN PATIENT
 ENROLLMENT] option. ES will send the VMBPs on file to the requesting site
 in an ORF-Z11 message. If the ORF-Z11 does not upload successfully, the
 user should open an incident by calling the Enterprise Service Desk (ESD)
 at 855-673-4357 or through YourIT.
  
 DG*5.3*987 also updates the LONG DESCRIPTION (#.04) field in the HEALTH
 BENEFIT PLAN (#25.11) file for the plan VETERAN PLAN - CCP HARDSHIP
 DETERMINATION.
  
 DG*5.3*987 converts the text to uppercase in the NAME (#.01) field of the
 HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN (#25.11) file. HBPs now display in uppercase letters 
 in VistA screens.
  
 Listing of Updates
 ==================
 This patch includes the following enhancements to VistA REE:
  
 1. A new INACTIVE (#.06) field is added to the HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN 
    (#25.11) file to indicate that an HBP is inactivated. When the   
    INACTIVE (#.06) field is set to YES, then the plan will not be
    displayed when the user selects the View All HBP Detail [DGEN HBP 
    DETAIL] action protocol to display the HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN <11.4>
    screen in VistA REE Registration options.
  
    If a Veteran was assigned to HBPs that are inactivated, the HBPs 
    will remain on the Veteran's profile so that they may be viewed 
    under "Current Health Benefit Plans" on the HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN 
    <11.1> screen.
  
    Inactivation of Veteran Plans occurs in the HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN
    (#25.11) file utilizing the new INACTIVE (#.06) field. The INACTIVE 
    (#.06) field is set to YES for the following HBPs:
       a. VETERAN PLAN - VC UNUSUAL OR EXCESSIVE BURDEN
       b. VETERAN PLAN - VETERANS CHOICE AIR, BOAT, OR FERRY
       c. VETERAN PLAN - VETERANS CHOICE BASIC 
       d. VETERAN PLAN - VETERANS CHOICE MILEAGE
       e. VETERAN PLAN - VETERANS CHOICE WAIT-TIME  
  
 2. The LONG DESCRIPTION (#.04) field in the HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN (#25.11) 
    file for the VETERAN PLAN - CCP HARDSHIP DETERMINATION plan is updated
    to the following:
  
    The Veteran must be enrolled in the VA health care system. The 
    Veteran who may meet new MISSION Act access standards (wait time and
    drive time) may still face an unusual or excessive burden in accessing
    care at the VA based on:
    . Geographical challenges
    . Environmental factors such as:
      o Roads that are not accessible to the general public, such as a road
        through a military base or restricted area
      o Traffic, or
      o Hazardous weather conditions
    . A medical condition that impacts the ability to travel
    . Meets MISSION Act access standard, but, must travel by air, boat, or
      ferry
    And
    . Veteran has received a "COMMUNITY CARE-HARDSHIP DETERMINATION"  
      consult and the consult has not expired then the Veteran will be 
      eligible for Hardship.  
  
 3. The text of the data in the HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN (#25.11) file in 
    the NAME (#.01) field is converted from mixed case to uppercase. All  
    entries within the file are converted. In the Inquire to File Entries 
    [DIINQUIRE] option, HBP name inquiries are now case insensitive. The
    conversion is done by a pre-install routine.
  
    HBPs now display in uppercase letters in VistA screens as a result
    of the case conversion. Registration options/screens that display the
    Veteran's current HBP(s) are the following: 
  
    - Registration options that display HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN <11.1> screen, 
      HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN <11.3> screen, and HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN <11.4> 
      screen. 
  
    - The Patient Inquiry [DG PATIENT INQUIRY] option and VistA Packages
      that call the Patient Inquiry API (DGRPD) display a Veteran's 
      current HBP(s) and this inquiry display is also initially presented
      in the Registration options such as Register A Patient [DG REGISTER
      PATIENT] option and Load/Edit Patient Information [DG LOAD PATIENT   
      DATA] option.
  
 4. Twenty-one new plans have been added to the HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN 
    file (#25.11). The data is provided in the build with the full data
    dictionary of the HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN file (#25.11).
     a. VETERAN - FULL MEDICAL BENEFITS TREATMENT & RX COPAY EXEMPT

 Post-Installation Instructions: 
 -------------------------------
 The HL7 incoming filers should be restarted. Use the Restart/Start All 
 Links and Filers [HL TASK RESTART] option on the Filer and Link
 Management Options [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu on the HL7 Main Menu    
 [HL MAIN MENU].
  
 Back-Out/Roll Back Plan:
 ------------------------
 In the event a site determines that this patch should be backed out, the 
 site should submit a YOUR IT Services ticket with the ESD for assistance
 with the procedure.
  
 Any issues would need to be evaluated to determine if: a back-out of the 
 software is appropriate; a new patch is needed; or if data requires 
 correction or restoration.
   
 During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as
 directed, "Backup a Transport Global", then routines will have the 
 ability to be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was 
 generated. However, the KIDS installation process does not perform a
 backup of other VistA software components, such as DD, cross-reference,
 and template changes.
