Description:
============

 Patch DG*5.3*935 is being released to support the enhancements for the
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on 
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) project, which supports
 Enrollment System Community Care (ESCC).
    
 Patch DG*5.3*935 is being released with the Income Verification Match (IVM) 
 patch IVM*2*167 in host file DG_53_P935.KID. The changes include the following.
  
 The name of a Health Benefit Plan (HBP) is corrected. "Veteran Plan - 
 Veterans Choice Wait Time" Health Benefit Plan is changed to "Veteran 
 Plan - Veterans Choice Wait-Time".  A hyphen was added to "Wait-Time".  
  
 The Department of Defense (DoD) Electronic Data Interchange Person Identifier
 (EDIPI) is updated on the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology
 Architecture (VistA) system via the Master Veterans Index (MVI). The EDIPI 
 number is retrieved via the VAFCTFU2 Remote Procedure Call.  The Member 
 Identifier (ID), also known as EDIPI, will be displayed on the header banner
 on Registration Screens for the following options.
 (All menu options below use the same updated header banner)

 The Military Service Future Discharge Date (FDD) build components include
 changes to manage, process, and display the FDD record. The record can be
 manually updated in the Enrollment System (ES) and is read-only in VistA
 Registration. The FDD record can be received from the military service broker
 or via an on-line healthcare application. A Veteran can apply for Department 
 of Veterans Affairs (VA) health benefits enrollment before being discharged
 from the military. The ES is the VA authoritative system for this 
 information. VistA will update the military service episode (MSE) list and 
 the FDD record to match the data provided by ES. The FDD record will not be 
 transmitted from VistA to ES.
  
 1.  Update VistA to receive the FDD record in the ZMH message segment on the 
     ORU-Z11 or ORF-Z11 Health Level Seven (HL7) message from ES. The FDD MSE 
     received from ES is designated with a ZMH segment type of FDD and will 
     contain the Branch of Service, Service Entry Date, and Future Discharge 
     Date data components.
  
 2.  Update VistA to store the FDD record received from ES.  
  
    a. VistA will store the FDD record in the existing MILITARY SERVICE 
       EPISODE sub-file (#.3216) of the PATIENT file (#2).  The FDD will be 
       stored in the FUTURE DISCHARGE DATE field (#.08) in the MILITARY 
       SERVICE EPISODE sub-file (#.3216) of the PATIENT file (#2).
   
    b. The VistA system will remove the military service episode and 
       associated Future Discharge Date when notified by ES that the Future
       Discharge Date is expired or deleted. The absence of the FDD record ZMH 
       segment on the ORU-Z11 or ORF-Z11 HL7 message from ES will result in 
       the deletion of the FDD record in VistA.
  
    c. FDD is an optional field in ES so it will not always be displayed in
       VistA.
  
 3.  Update VistA to display the Future Discharge Date when the FDD exists.   
     The FDD will be displayed on the MILITARY SERVICE DATA, SCREEN <6> and
     MILITARY SERVICE DATA, SCREEN <6.1> screen in the following Menu options.
  
     Load/Edit Patient Data                [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
     Register a Patient                    [DG REGISTER PATIENT]

     Eligibility Verification              [DG ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION]
  
    a. VistA will display the FDD received from ES and will not perform
       date validation on the FDD.
  
 4.  The user will only see FDD displayed on the MILITARY SERVICE DATA,
     SCREEN <6.1> when inconsistencies exist for the enrollment information 
     group for the following Menu option.  The FDD record will display if
     it exists.

 5. A VistA user will not be able to add, edit, or delete an FDD record. 
    When an FDD ZMH record is received from ES, a one (1) is stored in the
    DATA LOCKED field (#.07) of the MILITARY SERVICE EPISODE sub-file
    (#.3216) of the PATIENT file (#2). This indicates to VistA that the 
    data came from ES and cannot be altered.
  
 6. VistA Registration will not send an FDD record to downstream applications. 
    When an associated Future Discharge Date exists (that is not null), the 
    VADPT and VAFHLZMH Application Programming Interface (API) calls will not 
    include the FDD record.
  
 7. When adding an MSE in VistA, if the user enters a Service Entry Date or a
    Service Separation Date that overlaps with an FDD record, an error message
    will display, stating that an overlap was entered. A screen shot was added
    to the User Manual - Registration Menu.
  
    Message Text:                  
    Date overlaps with a record that has a Future Discharge Date.
   
 8. The VADPT Application Programming Interface (API) returns patient-related
    data. This API was updated to exclude any FDD record. The line tags 
    for this API are SVC^VADPT, 7^VADPT, and 8^VADPT. The Integration Control
    Registration (ICR) for VADPT is 10061. More details can be found in
    FORUM, in the documentation of ICR 10061.
