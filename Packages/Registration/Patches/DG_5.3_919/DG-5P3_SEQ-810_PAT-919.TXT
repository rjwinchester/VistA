Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ENHANCEMENTS - ITERATION 15

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 *************************************************************************
 * This patch may be installed with users on the system, however because *
 * the patient lookup routines are being exported with this patch, we    *
 * strongly advise that it be installed after business hours.            *
 *************************************************************************
  
 DG*5.3*915 is the only required build for patch DG*5.3*919.
  
 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) enhancements are being distributed in
       three VistA namespaces: DG, RG and MPIF.
       The enhancements related to this patch are only being distributed in
       the DG and MPIF VistA namespaces. MPIF*1.0*62 should be installed
       before DG*5.3*919 for non-legacy sites (do NOT install MPIF*1.0*62
       on legacy sites), as the new Swipe/Scan process being exported in 
       this patch will not work without MPIF*1.0*62. 
       Therefore it is recommended that these patches be installed in the
       following order on non-legacy sites: 
              MPIF*1.0*62 and then DG*5.3*919.
  
       DG*5.3*919 should be installed immediately after installing
       MPIF*1.0*62. 
  
 NOTE: Legacy sites can install just the DG*5.3*919 patch, as legacy sites
       won't use the data capture process. 
       MPIF*1.0*62 should NOT be installed on legacy sites.
  
 Enhancement
 The enhancement exported in this patch updates the routine DPTLK so that
 anytime a Veteran Health Information Card (VHIC) or the Department of
 Defense's (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC) is presented and swiped or 
 scanned at the facility, the activity is captured and stored locally at
 the site in the ^XTMP("MPIFCARD") global location. This stored activity
 data which consists of the card's ID, type of Card (VHIC or CAC) and the
 event type (swipe or scan) will be downloaded nightly by the Master
 Patient Index (MPI) for use by the Healthcare Identity Management (HC IdM)
 team for reporting purposes. 
   
 Issue #1
 Routines DPTLK4 and DPTLK7 were updated so that the WHO ENTERED
 PATIENT field (#.096) in the PATIENT file (#2) is populated for new
 patients registered with the REGISTER A PATIENT [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
 menu option.
   
 Issue #2
 Finally, routines DPTLK4 and DPTLK7 were also updated to ensure that the 
 'NEW PATIENT ADDED TO SYSTEM' MailMan messages are generated when a new
 patient is registered at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC)
 through the REGISTER A PATIENT [DG REGISTER PATIENT] menu option.

 CA Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 1. I7264886FY16 - WHO ENTERED PATIENT field (#.096) in the PATIENT
                   file (#2) no longer populated
  
 Problem:
 --------
 After the release of patch DG*5.3*915 it was determined that the
 WHO ENTERED PATIENT field (#.096) of the PATIENT file (#2) was not
 being populated after a new patient was registered with the REGISTER
 A PATIENT [DG REGISTER PATIENT] menu option. After further 
 investigation, this issue was found to be a long standing problem,
 but only when a patient was registered with either a legacy Veterans
 Identification Card (VIC) or the newer VHIC cards. This issue went
 unnoticed until now due to the limited use of these cards.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Updates were made to the patient registration software, specifically
 routines DPTLK4 and DPTLK7, to populate the WHO ENTERED PATIENT field
 (#.096) in the PATIENT file (#2) when a patient registration is 
 performed with a legacy VIC or newer VHIC cards or through the 
 REGISTER A PATIENT [DG REGISTER PATIENT] menu option. 
 Note: This field is historically populated directly by the 
       REGISTATION (DG) software and not a FileMan (FM) trigger.

 There are no Pre/Post installation routine processes.   
   
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 ----------------------------- 
 This patch takes less than 2 minutes to install.  This patch may be 
 installed with users on the system. However, because the patient lookup
 routines are impacted, we strongly advise that it be installed after
 business hours.  
  
 The following OPTIONs should be disabled during installation:
      Load/Edit Patient Data                      [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
      Register a Patient                          [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
      Preregister a Patient                       [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]
      Electronic 10-10EZ Processing               [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING] 
      Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES]
  
 The HL7 incoming filers should be stopped.  Use the Monitor, Start, Stop
 Filers [HL FILER MONITOR] option on the Filer and Link Management Options
 [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu on the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU].
   
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------

 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the

     number (i.e. DG*5.3*919):
   
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
