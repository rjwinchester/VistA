 The Means Test thresholds for Calendar Year 2017 are distributed with this
 patch. The post-installation routine, DG53930P, will create a new subentry
 (or replace an existing one) for calendar year 2017 in the MEANS TEST DATA
 (#250) multiple field of the MAS PARAMETERS (#43) file. 
  
 This patch, DG*5.3*930, is one of three VistA 2017 threshold patches. It 
 updates the thresholds for the Means Tests and the Maximum Annual Pension 
 Rate. Patch EAS*1.0*144 will address the annual updates for the GMT 
 Thresholds and patch IB*2.0*583 will address the annual updates for the 
 Pharmacy Copay Thresholds.

 R10750194FY16 - 2017 MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Annual updates of Means Test thresholds are needed for calendar year 2017 
 (income year 2016). 
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The post-installation routine, DG53930P, will create a new subentry
 (or replace an existing one) for calendar year 2017 in the MEANS TEST DATA
 (#250) multiple field of the MAS PARAMETERS (#43) file. 
  
  
 Six subfields within the multiple will be updated with the new Means Test
 threshold data values as follows:
  
        MEANS TEST DATA (#.01) - 2017
        MT COPAY EXEMPT VET INCOME (#2) - $32,074
        MT COPAY EXEMPT 1ST DEP INCOME (#3) - $6,415
        MT COPAY EXEMPT INCOME PER DEP (#4) - $2,205
        THRESHOLD PROPERTY (#8) - $80,000
        CHILD INCOME EXCLUSION (#17) - $10,400
  
 In addition, this patch will update the following entries in the 
 PARAMETERS file (#8989.5) for Income Year 2016 to:
  
        DGMT MAPR GLOBAL RATE         5 
        DGMT MAPR 0 DEPENDENTS        12907
        DGMT MAPR 1 DEPENDENTS        16902
        DGMT MAPR N DEPENDENTS        2205
  
  
  
 Software Retrieval:
 ===================
 The software for this patch is not being distributed through the National 
 Patch Module. This patch is being distributed as a host file. The host 
 file will contain the following three KIDS builds:
  
             Host file name:    DG_53_930.KID
  
                     Builds: DG*5.3*930
                             EAS*1.0*144
                             IB*2.0*583
  
 Sites may retrieve the software directly using Secure File Transfer
 Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the
 following OI Field Offices: 
  
  
                     Albany   : domain.ext
                     Hines    : domain.ext
               Salt Lake City : domain.ext
       First Available Server : download.vista.domain.ext
  
 The following file will be available:
  
 File Name            Description
 ---------            -----------
 DG_53_930.KID        Host File containing KIDS software distribution
  
 Note:  Use ASCII mode when transferring the .KID file.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This host file (containing three patches) can be installed with users on
 the system.  The installation should not be queued to run.  Installation
 will take approximately 10 minutes. The updates to the GMT THRESHOLDS
 file (#712.5) in patch EAS*1.0*144, are extensive. Due to the volume of
 updates, the installation process will appear to stall and/or stop. This
 is normal, as the file updates may take up to 10 minutes to complete.
  
        *****Please be patient and allow the process to complete.*****
  
 Also, when comparing the transport global to the current system, entries 
 will scroll by on the screen.  This is normal as there are approximately
 42,266 entries included in the GMT THRESHOLDS file (#712.5) distributed
 with this patch and a comparison is done on each of these entries. It is
 possible your session may time out before the install has completed. If
 so, you may not be able to get a complete screen capture of the compare.
 This will not, however, mean that there is any problem with the software.
 To avoid a session time-out, you can designate a printer (non-queued) as
 the device for the installation.

        b.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
        c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch

        d.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the

                                    ------------------
        **This is the step to start the installation of this KIDS patch:
  
       a.  Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch install.
  
       b.  The BILLING EXEMPTIONS file (#354.1) will be checked for
           medication co-payment exemptions based on prior thresholds.
           If -- and only if -- there are exemptions, you will be prompted
           to UPDATE AND PRINT the exemptions report.  NOTE:  the report is
           not new and is intended only as an FYI for billing staff.
  
              Select Action:  (P/U): Update & Print//
  
           Press <Enter> to accept the default "Update & Print"
  
              Select Device:
  
           You must enter a print device.  An entry is required and HOME,
           SPOOLER, or P-MESSAGE are not allowed. You MUST choose a
           valid printer or the installation will be aborted.
  
           NOTE: The exemption report contains full patient names and SSNs.
           Be sure to select a device in a secure area and retrieve the
           output immediately.
  
           You need not queue the report since the installation process
           will queue it automatically.

           NO//' answer NO.
