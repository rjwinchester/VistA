Description:
============

 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) 'EHRM (Electronic Health Record
       Modernization) SUPPORT' enhancements are being distributed
       in four VistA namespaces: DG, MPIF, RG and XU.
       The only build enforced requirement is that:
         - DG*5.3*981 be installed before MPIF*1.0*71.
       
       **Note: Patches RG*1.0*72 and XU*8.0*710 can be installed
               in any order as there are NO dependencies to these
               other patches.
       
       (Do NOT install MPIF*1.0*71 or RG*1.0*72 on legacy sites or
        on the FORUM CLAIMS system)
  
 NOTE: Legacy sites and the FORUM CLAIMS system can install just the
       DG*5.3*981 and XU*8.0*710 patches. MPIF*1.0*71 and RG*1.0*72
       should NOT be installed on legacy sites or on the FORUM CLAIMS
       system.  
  
 DG*5.3*825, DG*5.3*863, DG*5.3*967 and DG*5.3*974 are the required
 builds for patch DG*5.3*981.
  
 The following enhancements exported in this patch are needed to
 support the transition of sites to the EHRM (CERNER) application.
    
 Enhancement #1
 To ensure that TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) data returned from
 the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) [VAFC LOCAL GETCORRESPONDINGIDS] for
 a patient correctly identifies the IDENTIFIER STATUS (#12) of the
 record, the following enhancements will be implemented:
  
   - Created a new file "EHRM MIGRATED FACILITIES" (#391.919) that
     will store the facilities that have migrated to/implemented the
     CERNER application in support of EHRM.
  
     Note: The "ACRNR" new-style cross-reference (X-REF) was created
           at the record level of this file to allow for a quick check
           to determine if a facility has migrated to/implemented CERNER.
   
   - Created a new RPC [VAFC MVI MGRTD FACILITIES UPDT] that can be
     called from the Master Patient Index (MPI) to remotely add, update
     and maintain the facilities that are currently implementing CERNER
     in the EHRM MIGRATED FACILITIES (#391.919) file.     
    
   - Created a new routine VAFCCRNR that will be triggered by the RPC
     [VAFC MVI MGRTD FACILITIES UPDT] to receive a list of Station
     Numbers from MPI for facilities that have migrated to CERNER for 
     maintaining the EHRM MIGRATED FACILITIES (#391.919) file with.
     
   - Finally, routine VAFCTFU2 associated with the RPC [VAFC LOCAL
     GETCORRESPONDINGIDS] was modified so that the returned IDENTIFIER
     STATUS (#12) value in the TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file is
     transmitted as "C" if it is currently assigned an "A" (Active) or
     NULL value AND the facility has migrated to/implemented CERNER.
  
     Note: Merged "H" identifier statuses will continue to be returned
           as denoted even if the treating facility has migrated 
           to/implemented CERNER. 
  
 Enhancement #2
 To support EHRM during the creation of patients that have potential
 matching Department of Defense (DoD) records being returned for
 selection in Enterprise Registration, an additional entry labeled
 'selectedIdentifier' will be transmitted in the eXtensible Markup
 Language (XML) explicit 'ADD' message to MPI upon creation of the
 patient at the site. The 'selectedIdentifier' entry will contain
 one of the following values below to identify the existing record
 that was selected from Enterprise Registration if applicable:
  
    - "" 
         Null if no results returned or nothing selected from results.
    - "<EDIPI>^NI^200DOD^USDOD"
         (DoD's) Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier 
         (EDIPI) if a DoD record was selected from the results list.
    - "<ICN>^NI^200M^USVHA"
         Integration Control Number (ICN) if any other Non-DoD record
         was selected from the results list.
  
 NOTE: The identifier value will be determined/created in routine
       DPTLK7 and then added to the XML message for transmission to
       the MPI in routine MPIFXMLI.
  
 Enhancement #3
 In support of the Health Administration Center (HAC) and MPI integration
 routine VAFCQRY1 (Patient Demographics Query for building the Patient
 Identification (PID) Health Level Seven (HL7) segment) was updated to
 include the HAC local modifications in support of CH*1.3*22529. These
 modifications will ensure that the correct Station Number of '741MM' is
 used when the HAC Station Number of '741' is encountered.

 and Link Management Options [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu on the HL7 Main
 Menu [HL MAIN MENU]. 
  
 Back-Out Plan
 -------------
 The DG patch back-out procedure would consist of restoring the original
 routines using the back-up message created during the patch installation,
 deleting the NEW routine 'VAFCCRNR', RPC [VAFC MVI MGRTD FACILITIES UPDT]
 from the REMOTE PROCEDURE (#8994) file and file EHRM MIGRATED FACILITIES
 (#391.919). 
  
 If assistance is still required to back-out the patch please contact the
 National Service Desk (NSD) to log a help desk ticket so the development
 team can assist in the process.
    
      Note: This process should only be done with the concurrence and
            participation of the development team and the appropriate
            VA Site/Region personnel.
