  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch DG*5.3*959 is being released to correct two defects found in patch 
 DG*5.3*935 (MEMBER ID, HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN, FUTURE DISCHARGE DATE 
 UPDATES).
  
 Patch DG*5.3*935, which was released on 2/7/2018 by the Enrollment System 
 Modernization (ESM) Project Team, included code to delete Health
 Eligibility Center (HEC)-owned Military Service Episodes (MSE) when an
 ORU-Z11 or ORF-Z11 HL7 message from ES does not contain any ZMH segments.
 This is an indication to Vista that all HEC-owned MSEs for a patient
 should be deleted from the Military Service Episode (MSE) sub-file
 (#.3216) in the Patient file (#2). The two defects associated with this
 functionality and their resolution are described in the 'Defect Tracking
 System Ticket(s) & Overview' section of this patch.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. Incident #I18942491FY18 - An error in routine DGNOZMH is occurring when
    processing an ORU-Z11 or ORF-Z11 HL7 message from ES with no ZMH
    segment.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An error <SUBSCRIPT>INCDEL+3^DGNOZMH is occurring when processing an
 ORU-Z11 or ORF-Z11 message with no ZMH segment.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 a. Rewrite of the code that checks the DATA LOCKED field (#.07) of the
 MSE record. If it equals 1, this is a HEC-owned MSE and should be deleted.
 The logic did not account for having a zero (header) node for the MSE
 multiple (^DPT(DFN,.3216,0)) that is incomplete (not having four pieces of
 data, the last two of which define the last MSE subscript and the number
 of MSE entries in the #.3216 sub-file). A couple of examples are:
 ^DPT(DFN,.3216,0)="^2.3216D" and ^DPT(DFN,.3216,0)="^2.3216^^0". When
 either of these zero nodes are encountered when processing an ORU-Z11 
 or ORF-Z11 HL7 message from ES with no ZMH segment, the system errors out
 with a SUBSCRIPT error. The logic now determines if the zero node is
 complete before deleting HEC-owned MSEs. Otherwise, it QUITS and returns
 to process the next Z11 segment.
  
 b. In addition to the change described above, the logic also checks for 
 incomplete MSEs in the #.3216 sub-file and deletes them if they do not
 have the required fields (no DISCHARGE DATE (#.03) and no FUTURE
 DISCHARGE DATE (#.08)). The logic was checking only the last MSE, but
 now it checks all MSEs.
  
 2. Incident (Internal) - Defect discovered internally during research of
    Incident #I18942491FY18
  
 Problem:
 --------
 This defect was discovered internally during research of Incident 
 #I18942491FY18. When an ORU-Z11 or ORF-Z11 HL7 message from ES doesn't
 have any MSE-type ZMH segments, but it does have a non-MSE ZMH segment,
 the MSEs in the Patient file (#2) sub-file #.3216 are not deleted; only
 the non-MSE ZMH segment(s) are processed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 There is now a distinction between an MSE ZMH and a non-MSE ZMH, so when
 there are no MSE ZMH segments, but there is at least one non-MSE ZMH
 segment, the MSEs in node #.3216 are deleted and the non-MSE(s) are
 processed.

 Back-Out Plan
 -------------
 In the event a site determines that this patch should be backed out, the 
 site should submit a Your IT Services ticket with the Enterprise Service
 Desk (ESD) for assistance with the procedure.
  
 1. Back-out Procedure:
  
 Prior to installing this patch (DG*5.3*959), the installer should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 2. Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
  
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the DG* routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 DG*5.3*959 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 routines will no longer contain the designation of patch DG*5.3*959 in
 the patch list section on line 2.
