Subject: VETERANS HEALTH IDENTIFICATION CARD (VHIC) APPLICATION, VERSION 4.4

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC) web application version 4.4
 provides several upgrades and enhancements within the national release of
 VHIC.
  
 Enhancements:
 =============
  
 - On Hold Card Requests
       o If Enrollment Services and/or Identity Proofing are unavailable,
         VHIC will allow the card request process to continue.
       o Partially completed requests will be placed on Hold, allowing a
         clerk to continue the process later.
       o The partially complete card request that was placed on "hold" 
         shall be retrievable to users authorized to create a VHIC card
         request (VHIC Associate, VHIC Supervisor, and VHIC Administrator).
       o Veterans with Eligibility status of Pending or Unverified will be
         able to complete a card request.  The system will place the
         request on hold.  When the Veteran's status becomes Eligible, the
         request will be processed automatically.
       o Users can also place requests on hold at their discretion to be
         continued later.
  
 - Address Handling Improvements
       o Users will now be able to select to have a card mailed to the 
         following:
            Veteran Address as recorded in Enrollment Services
            Veteran Address as recorded in the Master Veteran Index
            Mailing address of the Requesting VA Facility
       o If a Bad Address Indicator flag is set in Enrollment Services,
         only the requesting Facility address will be selectable.
  
 - Image Upload
       o Users will be able to upload an image or reuse the existing image 
         in the VHIC database (as long as it is less than 9 years old).
