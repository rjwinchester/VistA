Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM MODERNIZATION (ESM) HL7 ERROR REMOVAL

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch supports the Enrollment Health Benefit Determination (EHBD)
 Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) requirements. 
  
 * Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) defines health benefit plan(s) for
   which a client (Veteran, Service member, or beneficiary) is eligible and
   ties them to the authority for care. Key enhancements include Pending  
   Eligibility Determination; fixes to the Enrollment System; Date of Death;   
   Internal Controls; Workflow; Veterans Financial Assessment; converting of 
   Military Service Data Sharing (MSDS) to Enterprise Military Information
   Service (eMIS); Manage Relationships; and Veteran Contact Service.
  
 DG*5.3*934 provides enhancements in support of the ESM project and
 the Enrollment System (ES) 4.6.0 release. Refer to Informational Patch
 EAS*1.0*147.
  
 The HL7 Error Removal build components will include removing the validation
 check which eliminates the error that is triggered if the VistA record has an
 Eligibility Status of Verified and the ES ORU or ORF Z11 message has an
 Eligibility Status of Pending Verification or Pending Re-Verification from 
 being sent back to ES.  This error is only reflected in ES and does not show
 as an error on VistA.
  
 Listing of Updates
 ==================
  
 When changing Eligibility status from VERIFIED to PENDING VERIFICATION, the
 ORUZ11 is transmitted to VistA. UFT reports that sometimes the Z11 processes
 without error, and other times it errors. When the Z11 errors, this is the
 message: Enrollment Status Pending-Eligibility is Verified
  
 Routine DGENUPL2 was updated to allow the ES ORU/ORF Z11 messages to upload
 and NOT trigger an error if the VistA record has an Eligibility Status of
 Verified and the ES ORU or ORF Z11 message has an Eligibility Status of
 Pending Verification or Pending Re-Verification.
