 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1.  INC000000207246    Patient File Update Utility
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Patient File Update Utility is not correctly dinuming patients with
     multiple races or their ethnicity after the information is received
     from the Master Veteran Index (MVI),the last treatment facility, 
     and/or the Enrollment System (ES).
     "Dinum" refers to how the RACE INFORMATION (#2.02) and ETHNICITY
     INFORMATION (#2.06) fields are stored and referenced in the PATIENT  
     (#2) file. This is not immediately noticeable when displaying a 
     patient's race/ethnicity, but downstream issues can occur when this
     information is accessed elsewhere in the VistA system and when the
     data is transported to third parties.
     
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modify routine ^DGROHLR1 (Register Once Messaging (ROM) HL7 Receive
     Driver).  Change the FileMan call for race/ethnicity filing (FILE
     paragraph) from UPDATE^DIE to FILE^DICN. This will store the RACE
     INFORMATION (#2.02) and ETHNICITY INFORMATION (#2.06) fields 
     correctly in the PATIENT (#2) file.
  
  
 Software Retrieval:
 ===================
 Patches for this installation are combined in host file DG_53_P897.KID.
  
 Installation of this host file should be coordinated among the packages 
 affected since only one installation is necessary.
  
 The patches are:
  
  DG*5.3*897
  IVM*2.0*159
  
 Sites may retrieve the KIDS build in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
  download.vista.domain.ext which will transmit the files from the first 
  available FTP server.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve the patch directly from a specific
  server as follows:
  
   OIFO               FTP ADDRESS                  DIRECTORY
   --------------     ------------------------     ------------------
   Albany             ftp.domain.ext     
   Hines              ftp.domain.ext      
   Salt Lake City     ftp.domain.ext        
  
   
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch will be released in conjunction with an Income Verification 
 Match (IVM) patch, IVM*2.0*159, as part of a combined build.
  
  
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours.
   
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
   
      1. Obtain the file DG_53_P897.KID
   
      2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
         the Installation menu.
  
      3. Use Load a Distribution using DG_53_P897.KID when
         prompted to Enter a Host File name.  You may need to append a
         directory name.
   
      4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
         (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*897):
          a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
              you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
              transport global.
          b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
              the components of the KIDS build.
          c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
              allow you to view all changes that will be made when 
              this patch is installed.  It compares all components of 
              this patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
          d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
              message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
              backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
    
      5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//"
         respond NO.
    
      6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
         and Protocols? YES//" respond YES.
  
         When prompted, 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of
         Order':'enter:
              
           Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
           Register a Patient [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
  
         When prompted, 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of
         Order':', press enter. 
  
  
 POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==============================
  a.  Installing the patch will NOT do the file cleanup. First, run 
      REPORT^DG53P897 (you must queue the report) to obtain a list
      by DFN of what the cleanup will do. We expect few, if any,
      duplicates, but all the records that the Register Once Messaging 
      (ROM) application has processed will need cleanup.
  
  b.  When you are ready to do the actual cleanup (assuming there are 
      records in the report), run CLEANUP^DG53P897. The job should be
      queued to run during non-peak hours because of the heavy
      processing involved.  When the cleanup has completed, run
      REPORT^DG53P897 again but in a different session. It should 
      display "no records to report". You can then delete routine
      DG53P897.
  
  c.  Sites may encounter the following error: 
      <UNDEFINED>PIVNW+61^VAFHPIVT during the running of the File
      Cleanup, CLEANUP^DG53P897.  This error does not stop processing
      and is not a concern, as this is a timing issue within the file.
