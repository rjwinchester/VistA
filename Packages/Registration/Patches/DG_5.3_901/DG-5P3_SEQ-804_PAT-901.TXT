 **************************************************************************
  
 This patch modified the Registration v5.3 application as described below: 
  
 The Master Veteran Index (MVI) will become the Department of Veteran 
 Affairs (VA) one authoritative service for managing Date of Death
 information. Given the promotion of the Veteran Health Administration 
 (VHA) Identity Service (IdS) as the VA enterprise-wide identity management
 system, it was necessary to re-examine the rules for authoritative
 sources to add, delete, or update the Date of Death data.  Moving to MVI
 as the single authoritative system leveraging authoritative sources will
 ensure accuracy and consistency of Date of Death data across the VA
 enterprise. The Date of Death will be promoted to the MVI's Primary View
 and provided to MVI consumers.
  
 This patch modifies the Registration v5.3 application as described below: 
  
   - When  a VistA user edits or modifies the Date of Death, they must 
     select one of the three approved sources of notification.  The 
     approved choices for  the SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION (#.353) field in the 
     PATIENT (#2) file are Inpatient at VAMC (1),Death Certificate on File
     (3), or NCA (7).  There are no requirements to update existing date
     of death records.    
 
   - A VistA user may delete a date of death when the date of death was 
     entered by a user at that site or at a child/satellite facility of
     that site. 
  
   - When a VistA user attempts to edit the date of death, the system will
     check the LAST EDITED BY field (#.355) in the PATIENT (#2) file.  The
     following message will be displayed if the LAST EDITED BY field 
     (#.355) in the PATIENT (#2) file is not a defined user at the site: 
     "YOU MAY NOT EDIT DATE OF DEATH IF IT WAS NOT ENTERED BY A USER AT 
     THIS SITE".  See example below:
 
     Select Registration Menu <TEST ACCOUNT> Option: DEATH ENTRY
 
 
     Select PATIENT NAME: REGPATIENT,ONE,ONE  REGPATIENT,ONE  4-27-59    
     666878793    NO     NSC VETERAN      
     Enrollment Priority: GROUP 5    Category: NOT ENROLLED  
     End Date: 05/05/2015
 
 
     YOU MAY NOT EDIT DATE OF DEATH IF IT WAS NOT ENTERED BY A USER 
     AT THIS SITE
 
 
     Select PATIENT NAME: 
 
 Future patch(es) will be released to discontinue sharing the Date of Death with
 ES and to share and receive Date of Death information with the MVI.
