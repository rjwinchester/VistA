Subject: OPERATION REPORT ADDENDUM UPLOAD FIELDS BLANK

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue in the Text Integration
 Utilities (TIU) package:
  
 1. When uploading an OPERATION REPORT, allow the AUTHOR/DICTATOR (#1202)
    field and the ATTENDING PHYSICIAN (#1209) field of the TIU DOCUMENT
    FILE (#8925) file to be populated into addendums to OPERATION REPORT
    documents.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000454162 - Uploaded documents create addendum without an author
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When using the VistA Upload Documents [TIU UPLOAD DOCUMENTS] option 
   to upload an addendum to an operation report, if the system finds a 
   match for the patient and surgery case, the document is uploaded and 
   filed successfully, however the AUTHOR/DICTATOR (#1202) field and the 
   ATTENDING PHYSICIAN (#1209) field of the TIU DOCUMENT FILE (#8925) file 
   are both blank. TIU*1.0*173 prevented these fields from being populated
   during the upload process, which is correct for the original operation
   report, but didn't allow these fields to be populated when an addendum
   is created.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Routine TIUPUTC will check if the uploaded OPERATION REPORT is an 
   addendum to an existing document, and if it is, allow the
   AUTHOR/DICTATOR (#1202) field and the ATTENDING PHYSICIAN (#1209) field
   to be populated.
