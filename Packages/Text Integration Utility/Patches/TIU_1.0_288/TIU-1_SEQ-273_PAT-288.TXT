 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1) INC000001069253 - Text Integration Utility - Document Parameters:
  
   Problem 1:
   ---------
 Document parameters cannot be deleted.  Using the @ at the DOCUMENT 
 DEFINITION: prompt in Document Parameter Edit [TIU DOCUMENT PARAMETER
 EDIT] option appears to allow the parameters to be deleted but they are
 actually not deleted.
  
   Resolution 1:
   ------------
 Modify routine TIUDPEDT to correct the code that prevented the @ from 
 being correctly sent to the FileMan edit routine (^DIE). This will allow 
 users with appropriate FileMan access the ability to delete the parameter.
  
 2) INC000001082264 - Text Integration Utility - Document Parameters:
  
   Problem 2:
   ----------
 While researching ticket INC000001069253, I found that there was the 
 ability to create multiple TIU DOCUMENT PARAMETERS (#8925.95) file records
 for a single document title or class.  If the DOCUMENT DEFINITION (#.01)
 field is modified then multiple parameter records can be created.  Only
 one parameter record should exist for any document title, class, or
 document class. A user would have to ignore a warning message (by
 overwriting NO to YES) before this issue could occur but the warning
 message isn't clear about what can occur.  What occurs is that the
 parameter record being edited is moved to another document title or
 class.  This 'new' record is in addition to any parameter record(s) that
 may have already existed.
  
   Resolution 2:
   ------------
 Modify routine TIUDPEDT so that the DOCUMENT DEFINITION (#.01) field 
 cannot be modified after selection.  If the DOCUMENT DEFINITION (#.01)
 field is edited then the message "This field cannot be modified." is
 displayed and the user will remain at the DOCUMENT DEFINITION prompt.  @
 (delete) and ^ (exit) are still valid entries.
  
  
 3) INC000001072528 - TIU REVIEW SCREEN MIS MANAGER  and TIU REVIEW SCREEN 
                      MRT not pulling in the correct report
  
   Problem 3:
   ---------
 The Multiple Patient Documents [TIU REVIEW SCREEN MIS MANAGER] option and 
 Multiple Patient Documents [TIU REVIEW SCREEN MRT] are pulling in more
 documents types than the intended document type (i.e. discharge summaries)
 into the TIU report.
  
   Resolution 3:
   ------------
 The routine TIURM1 is not always making correct decisions for including
 addendums on the reports.  If an addendum's parent type is a type selected
 by the user to display on the report then it is displayed correctly but if
 the parent is not of a selected type then it is dropping into logic that
 selects the addendum anyway.  The logic that it drops into will be updated
 to only select the addendum if the addendum is a type the user requested
 for the report.
