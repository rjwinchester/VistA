 The Community Care Referrals and Authorizations (CCR&A) application is 
 an enterprise-wide system used by Community Care (CC) staff to 
 automatically generate referrals and authorizations for all Veterans 
 receiving care in the community. Clinical and VA CC staff located at VA 
 Medical Centers, Outpatient Clinics, Community Based Outpatient Clinics, 
 and Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) offices use this
 application.  The CCR&A solution is an integral component of the VA
 Community Care Information Technology (IT) architecture that allows
 Veterans to receive care from Community Providers.
  
 This patch builds upon the Health Level 7(HL7) processes created in
 patches GMRC*3.0*99 and GMRC*3.0*106. It sends from Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) to HealthShare
 Referral Management system (HSRM) the CCRA progress notes filed by a
 provider for a patient in Computerized Patient Record System(CPRS).
  
 This patch builds and sends a VistA Outbound Medical Document Management 
 HL7 Message type (MDM-T02) v.2.5.1 message for any of the following CCRA
 Progress Note Titles that are used to file a historical Progress Notes
 from CPRS:
       1   COMMUNITY CARE-PATIENT LETTER       TITLE  
           Std Title: NONVA PROGRESS NOTE
       2   COMMUNITY CARE-ADMINISTRATIVE REQUEST       TITLE  
           Std Title: ADMINISTRATIVE NOTE
       3   COMMUNITY CARE-COORDINATION NOTE       TITLE  
           Std Title: NONVA PROGRESS NOTE
       4   COMMUNITY CARE-HOSPITAL NOTIFICATION NOTE       TITLE  
           Std Title: PRIMARY CARE ADMINISTRATIVE NOTE
  
 The patch installs also the following HL7 1.6 components:
         - new HL logical link: TIUCCRA 
         - new HL7 applications: TIU CCRA SEND and TIU HSRM RECEIVE
         - new HL7 Protocols:
                 1   TIU CCRA-HSRM MDM-T02 CLIENT
                 2   TIU CCRA-HSRM MDM-T02 SERVER
  
 The message is triggered by the routine in the POST-SIGNATURE CODE field 
 (#4.9), from the TIU Document Definition file (#8925.1).
  
 All CCRA Progress Note Titles that are created for COMMUNITY CARE
 Historical Notes and are required to trigger  the MDM-T02 message to HSRM.
  
 Please update the following for the above Note Titles. It requires 
 programmer access to edit the Post Signature Code field.
  
 In the TIU Document Definition file (#8925.1), in the POST-SIGNATURE CODE 
 field (#4.9) add this value: "D EN^TIUCCRHL()" (no quotes).
  
 Please refer to the OneConsult_Technical Guide, Section 14.0, for
 instruction on how to set up all the COMMUNITY CARE TIU Titles.

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 -------------------------------------
  Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this
  patch is available.
    
  The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
  This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may also
  elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server.
    
  Sites may retrieve the documentation directly using Secure File Transfer
  Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following OI
  Field Offices:
    
     Hines:                        domain.ext

 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ---------------------------------------------------- 
 Software is distributed by PackMan.
  
 Backout and rollback Procedure:
 -------------------------------
 In order to back out this patch, sites must use the
 KIDS option to Backup a Transport Global after loading
 the patch. They can then restore the routines from the
 backup message. If this option is not used, then backing
 out is not possible.
  
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch description.
  
 This patch consists of routines and HL7 Logical Link and HL7 Application 
 Parameters and HL7 Protocols. The routines installed by this patch are new
 routines. There are no changes to existing routines.
  
 If a backout or rollback is required, the site HL7 management team can 
 stop the HL7 Logical Link TIUCCRA that was installed by this patch.
  
 Stopping the TIUCCRA HL7 Logical Link will stop sending messages to the 
 TIU CCRA HealthShare server.
