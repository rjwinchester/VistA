 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) INC000000460134 
  
   Problem 1:
   ----------
 Document definition titles are not displaying properly in notes tab.  The list
 of TIU documents on the notes tab in CPRS [Computerized Patient Record System] 
 may show incorrect VHA [Veterans Health Administration] Standard Titles
 when a note in TIU DOCUMENT (#8925) FILE has the same IEN [internal entry
 number] as one defined in TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION (#8925.1) FILE.  The
 local title of the note is appended with an unrelated VHA Standard title.
 This is a bug in patch TIU*1.0*211, which added the mapping of the VHA
 Standard Titles. One of the intentions was to display the mapped VHA
 Standard Title after the local title. The problem is also seen for every
 local title that does not include the VHA Standard title on the notes tab
 list panel.
  
   Resolution 1:
   -------------
 We found that displaying the mapped Standard Titles introduced by TIU*1.0*211 
 was a result of VHA Directive 2005-044, and after initial complaints from the 
 sites testing version 3 of this patch, it was found that VHA NOTICE 2017-50 
 rescinded VHA Directive 2005-044. This means the requirement to display 
 mapped Standard Titles in the titles is no longer in effect.  Routine TIUSRVLO
 is modified to remove the [defective] logic that was intended to display the 
 mapped Standard Tiles after the Local Titles. 
  
 2) I7460078FY16 (PSPO #3102)
  
   Problem 2:
   ----------
 It was determined that the national object TIU TPBN ACT OUT MEDS was likely 
 causing the previous patient's data to be included in the current patient's
 note. We were unable to duplicate this issue but it is reasonable that the 
 object initialize the data elements it will build before creating them. This 
 object doesn't initialize the array to be returned and all other TIU objects do.
  
 Final assessment for patient risk was performed for PSPO #3102 on 5/16/16 by
 the Informatics Patient Safety Office and is provided at: 
 http://vaww.domain.ext/CHIO/includes/detail6.asp?offset=20&dbid=33557534 
  
   Resolution 2:
   -------------
 Modify TIUTPBN to initialize the TARGET variable at the beginning of entry
 point AOPMEDS.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ========================== 
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 2 minutes 
 to install.
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the
       INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
   
    3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter TIU*1.0*287)
    
         a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
             transport global.
         b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
             the components of the KIDS build.
         c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when this 
             patch is installed. It compares all components of this patch
             (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
         d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
             message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
             backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
       TIU*1.0*287
  
    5. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//", respond NO.  
   
    6. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//", respond NO.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
