Subject: INEFFICIENT CODE FOUND DURING RESEARCH

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue
      
 During analysis of another ticket INC5361702, an area of code associated 
 with the Alert Tracking module was discovered to need remediation.  This 
 patch will correct this design to not completely rebuild the Alert Tracking 
 entry for each multiple Additional Signer that is added but rather make a 
 single call to the TIU alert routine for all additional signers that will 
 create only one new Alert Tracker record each time one or more 
 additional signers are added.

 RTC Defect 1023789 - INC6113588 Inefficient code found during 
                                 research of INC5361702
       
 Problem:
 --------
 Presently, for each time an additional signer is added to a note, the code
 loops through and 'deletes' the original instance and rebuilds the new 
 updated information for each additional signer and adds a deleted 
 date/time stamp. This process occurs once for each additional signer 
 added.  This creates multiple Alert Tracking records when there are 
 multiple additional signers added.  This is not efficient coding and can 
 be misleading when reviewing the alert tracking file.  
       
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch will correct this design to create only one new Alert Tracker 
 record for all multiple Additional Signer that exist for the note.  Instead 
 of multiple calls to the TIU alert routine only a single call will be 
 made.  Routine TIULX will be modified to make a single call to
 SEND^TIUALRT when additional signers exist on the note.

 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 highly recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 1 minute
 to install.
        
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
       
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
       
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the 
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch#
     TIU*1.0*326:
       
    a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        (allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch  
        is installed.  It compares all components of this patch routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
       
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
       
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option 
     and choose the patch TIU*1.0*326 to install.
       
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
     Install? NO// YES' 
        
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO// NO
       
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO// NO' 
       
 8.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0.

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
        
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
       
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
       
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
       
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
