 This Sort Template, which is invoked by both the TIU HT TITLE MAPPINGS and
 TIU HT VERIFY TITLES options, sort the HT Titles by STATUS, then by NAME,
 thereby assuring that the active titles will appear at the top of the list
 produced in each of the reports.
  
  
  
 Additional Information:
  
 Routine Overview:
   TIUP258E
 This is the environment check routine.
 Check for the existence of:
  CLINICAL COORDINATOR user class
  CONSULTS document class
  CARE COORDINATION HOME TELEHEALTH NOTES or HOME TELEHEALTH NOTES 
  document class.  If neither document class is found, the post-install 
  will create a new document class for HOME TELEHEALTH NOTES.
  
   TIUP258
 This includes the pre-, and post-install code for patch TIU*1*258. Before
 the installation, it prepares the TIU environment for installation of the
 new titles, renaming existing titles as necessary. Following installation,
 it will introduce the new TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION entries to file 8925.1;
 attaches the new HT Titles to the appropriate Document Classes; maps them
 to their respective Enterprise Standard Titles; and activates them.

 Software & Documentation Retrieval Instructions
 ----------------------------------------------- 
 Software being released as a host file and/or documentation describing 
 the new functionality introduced by this patch are available. There is a
 multi-package build named HT TEMPLATES PROJECT 1.0 which contains the
 following KIDS builds: PXRM*2.0*19, TIU*1.0*258, and GMTS*2.7*98.  The
 associated host file is named HT_TEMPLATES_1_0.KID.
  
 Additionally, there are two TXML template files for use in CPRS GUI.  HT
 MONTLY MONITOR.TXML, and HT PROVIDER CONSULT.TXML are bundled in the
 HT_TXML_TEMPLATES.zip file. 
  
 IT installers should ensure that each site for which they are installing
 receive a copy of the zip file and the Install and Setup Guide.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at the following OI Field Offices:
    
 Albany:                 domain.ext
 Hines:                  domain.ext    
 Salt Lake City:         domain.ext
    
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library

 Patch Installation:
 ---------------------
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 This patch contains an environment check routine that runs once the 
 distribution has been loaded.  This routine checks for the following 
 conditions and will abort if any is met:
  
 1. Check USR CLASS (8930) file and abort install if the CLINICAL 
    COORDINATOR User Class is *not* found.
  
 2. Check TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file (8925.1) and abort install if the
    CONSULTS Document Class is *not* found.
  
 3. Pre-existing local titles where the name matches an incoming national
    title *and* that local title is *not* under the CARE COORDINATION HOME 
    TELEHEALTH NOTES, HOME TELEHEALTH NOTES, or CONSULTS document classes.
    Any titles matching these criteria will be displayed to the installer 
    and the installation will abort and the transport global will be
    unloaded.
  
  
 Pre: Prepares the TIU document hierarchy for the installation of the new 
 titles and document classes.
 1. Find the CARE COORDINATION HOME TELEHEALTH document class.  If found,
    disable the document class and then rename it to HOME TELEHEALTH NOTES.
  
 2. If the site has existing CCHT titles (CCHT pilot program sites) that
    are members of the HOME TELEHEALTH NOTES document class, rename those
    titles to the new "HT" naming convention.  Not all "CCHT" titles are
    renamed; only those matching the list of new titles will be renamed.
  
 3. Rename two titles previously released by TIU*1*200: CARE COORDINATION
    HOME TELEHEALTH SUBSEQUENT EVAL NOTE will be renamed to HT INTERVENTION
    NOTE CARE COORDINATION HOME TELEHEALTH SUMMARY OF EPISODE NOTE will be
    renamed to HT SUMMARY OF EPISODE NOTE.  These titles will only be 
    renamed if they are found to be members of the HOME TELEHEALTH NOTES
    document class.
  
 Post: 
 1. If not previously found and renamed during the pre-install, create the
    HOME TELEHEALTH NOTES document class as a member of the PROGRESS NOTES
    document class.
  
 3. If not previously found and renamed during the pre-install, create the
    Home Telehealth note titles and add them as members of the HOME
    TELEHEALTH NOTES document class.
  
 4. Attempt to map the HT TIU titles to the corresponding VHA Enterprise
    Standard Title.
  
 5. Perform minor re-indexing for ^TIU(8925.1
  
 Post: Optional -> If you are satisfied that the installation process 
 completed without error, and you do not need to review the code for any
 reason, you may wish to delete routine TIUP258 using the Kernel "Delete
 Routines" option [XTRDEL].
