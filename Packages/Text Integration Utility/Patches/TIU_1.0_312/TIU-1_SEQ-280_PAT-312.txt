 SDM Ticket Overview:
 ====================
 I12407898FY17
  
 Problem:
 ========
 HL7 processing encountered errors in interactive processing.  HL7 
 message processing is a background process and is not interactive and 
 should not enter any interactive process or function.  The errors are 
 seen in the error log as either FULL+2^VALM1 or HDR+13^PXBUTL. Although 
 these errors may have occurred, the TIU Progress Note is stored with the 
 electronic signature applied. Also, for MyHealtheVet Secure Messages, PCE 
 workload is still captured. It appears the only known negative results of
 the errors are:
  
 1) Errors are filed in the error trap
  
 2) TIU AUDIT TRAIL file (8925.5) isn't created (8925.5 records can be
    seen using option "Multiple Patient Documents"->Detailed Display)
  
 3) CREDIT STOP CODE ON COMPLETION field (#.11) is not cleared in TIU 
    DOCUMENT file (#8925)
  
 4) TIUHL7 Message Manager report (TIUHL7 MSG MGR) shows "unknown" 
    status for the messages that error out
  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 This patch will remove code that should not be in the TIUHL7U2 
 routine which runs as a background job. Field .11 will still be 
 cleared.
