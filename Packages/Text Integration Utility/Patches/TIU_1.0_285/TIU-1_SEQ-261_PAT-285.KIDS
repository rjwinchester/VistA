This patch will resolve a problem with the TIU REVIEW MRT ADD SGNR 
"BLD",9704,1,4,0)
report.  The report was not displaying all documents with 
"BLD",9704,1,5,0)
unsigned additional signatures.  The underlying issue was found to be a 
"BLD",9704,1,6,0)
problem with the AC index in file 8925.7 (TIU MULTIPLE SIGNATURE).  This 
"BLD",9704,1,7,0)
patch corrects the report by fixing the deficiency with the AC index 
"BLD",9704,1,8,0)
logic.  The post install routine rebuilds the AC index.
