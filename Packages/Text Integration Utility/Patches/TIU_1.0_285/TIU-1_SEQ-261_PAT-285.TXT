Subject: TIU FIX REVIEW UNSIGNED ADDITIONAL SIGNATURES REPORT INDEX

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve a problem with the Review unsigned additional 
 signatures option [TIU REVIEW MRT ADD SGNR] report.  The problem was that
 some documents with unsigned additional signatures were not showing up on
 the report.  The underlying issue was found to be a problem with the AC
 index in TIU MULTIPLE SIGNATURE file (#8925.7).  This patch corrects the
 report by fixing the deficiency with the AC index logic.

 Overview of Remedy ticket(s):
 ============================= 
 1) INC000000496538 - Report discrepancies
   
    Problem:
    --------  
    The Review unsigned additional signatures option [TIU REVIEW MRT ADD 
    SGNR] uses the AC index of the TIU MULTIPLE SIGNATURE file (#8925.7). 
    The AC index only exists once for multiple TIU MULTIPLE SIGNATURE
    records for the same TIU document and when one of these additional
    signers signs the TIU Document the AC index is deleted even if there
    are other additional signers that have yet to sign the document.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------   
    Modify the data dictionary for TIU MULTIPLE SIGNATURE file (#8925.7) so
    that the AC index is corrected to include the record pointer for file 
    #8925.7.  This will ensure that a unique AC index entry is created for 
    each additional signer. The post install routine TIU285PS is jobbed off
    and runs in the background.  It rebuilds the AC index and when finished
    a mailman message will be sent to the user installing the patch and
    mail group 'G.TIU CACS'.
