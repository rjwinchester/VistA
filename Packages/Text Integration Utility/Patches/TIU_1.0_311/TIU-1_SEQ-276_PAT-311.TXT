Subject: MOBILE ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTATION GUI 2FA IMPLEMENTATION

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will update the log in procedure to the Mobile Electronic 
 Documentation (MED) Graphical User Interface (GUI) to use Two Factor 
 Authentication (2FA) which will require the use of a Personal Identity 
 Verification (PIV) card.
  
 In order to make the transition to 2FA, it was also necessary to upgrade 
 the MED GUI to Delphi version XE8 to implement the new Remote Procedure 
 Call (RPC) Broker allowing compliance.

 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 The Department of Veterans Affairs Cybersecurity Task Force has been 
 tasked by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Inspector General
 (IG) to address identified material weaknesses. This task force has
 mandated that all internal, user facing VA applications become two factor
 authentication (2FA) compliant by April 30, 2017.
  
 In order to be compliant, applications are required to authenticate users 
 via Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards.  
  
 Note: Usernames and password will no longer be permitted for employees and
       contractors to access VA applications.  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 As part of the transition to 2FA,Mobile Electronic Documentation GUI was
 upgraded to Delphi XE8 to allow access to the latest version of the RPC
 Broker implementing 2FA.
  
 OTHER COMPONENTS:
 ================= 
 The following REMOTE PROCEDURE was added to retrieve the active version
 of the MED GUI.
  
 This REMOTE PROCEDURE was also added to the Mobile Electronic 
 Documentation [TIU MED GUI RPC V2] option to allow access to the 
 newly created RPC used by MED.
