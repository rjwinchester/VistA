 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC4179486 - Post-Signature alert using text event not sending alert
  
 Problem 1:
 -----------
 If the first Internal Entry Number (IEN) in TIU TEXT EVENTS (#8925.71) 
 file has INCLUDE SPACES=NO, and no matches are found during the search for
 that first IEN, then all subsequent searches will be missed.
  
 The "CASE SENSITIVE" parameter is not working as designed. The code 
 automatically converts all the search strings to lowercase. When the code 
 loops through each line of the TIU note, it also automatically converts 
 each line of text to lowercase. 
  
 The "INCLUDE SPACES" parameter is not working, when the code loops through
 each line of the TIU note, setting this parameter to "no" strips all
 spaces out of the TIU line. That means when this parameter is "no", then
 the Search Text should be entered without any spaces.
  
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
 This functionality was added with patch TIU*1.0*296 and has the flaws 
 noted in the problem listed above.  
  
 When the first IEN in TIU TEXT EVENTS (#8925.71) file has INCLUDE SPACES =
 NO and the corresponding search text is not found in the note text, then
 no other TIU Events' search text will work.  The 'Include Spaces'
 functionality is also flawed in that when it was set to NO, spaces were
 only stripped from the TIU Note text and not from the search text.  This
 patch removes the prompt for INCLUDE SPACES and spaces will now be removed
 from both search text as well as TIU note text during the text search
 comparison. 
  
 The Case Sensitivity functionality was not fully programmed and will be 
 removed since case sensitivity would increase the odds of an alert not 
 being sent due only to a case mismatch.  This patch removes the prompt for
 CASE SENSITIVE from the Text Event Edit [TIU TEXT EVENT EDIT] option and
 the search will not be case sensitive.
  
 When testing this patch, it was also found that when the Visit Search 
 String is entered in lower case, it is then compared to each VISIT 
 LOCATION names without converting to upper case (VISIT LOCATION (#5)
 fields are always stored in upper case).  Routine TIUTIUS was also
 modified to convert the Visit Search String to upper case for comparison
 to all VISIT LOCATION names.
  
 2. INC4799473 - TIU Text Alerts code does not work for addendums
  
 Problem 2:
 ----------
 MUMPS code 'D TASK^TIUTIUS(DA)' entered in the POST-SIGNATURE CODE (#4.9)
 field of the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION (#8925.1) file causes signature of
 the addendum to a TIU documents to initiate scanning the parent document
 for TIU Text Event alert phrases. This is incorrect as the parent document
 was scanned upon its signature and the text in the addendum is not
 scanned.
  
 Resolution 2:
 -------------
 This functionality was added with patch TIU*1.0*296 and has the flaws 
 noted in the problem listed above.  
  
 When an addendum was signed it did not search for any text in that 
 addendum because the parent IEN was passed to the routine instead of the 
 addendum's IEN. After the installation of this patch, post signature code 
 will now need to be set to D TASK^TIUTIUS($S($G(DAORIG):DAORIG,1:DA)) in 
 order to correctly search either a parent note or addendum when each is 
 signed. 
  
 Also, during investigation of these issues, it was found that there was no
 fail-safe code to execute the post-signature search (DQ^TIUTIUS) if it
 failed to run it as a background task.  Code was added to run it in the
 foreground if the background failed to run.

 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL INSTRUCTIONS:
 =====================================
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the documentation directly using Secure File Transfer 
 Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following OI
 Field Offices:
    
 Hines:                  domain.ext    
 Salt Lake City:         domain.ext

 Patch Installation:
 ===================
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system but users should not 
 be accessing the TIU TEXT EVENT EDIT option during the install.
 Installation should take less than 1 minute to complete.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
    Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following
    options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch TIU*1.0*324

       other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow
       you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
       installed.  It compares all components of this patch routines, DDs,
       templates, etc.

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 For this patch to work correctly, all post-signature codes that are
 defined as:             "TASK^TIUTIUS(DA)"
 should be modified to:  "TASK^TIUTIUS($S($G(DAORIG):DAORIG,1:DA))"
  
 OI&T should work with the Clinical Application Coordinators to modify 
 this field appropriately.
  
 To locate TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITIONS that need updating, run a VA FileMan 
 search:
  
 Select OPTION: SEARCH FILE ENTRIES  
  
 Output from what File: TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION//   (1835 entries)
  
   -A- SEARCH FOR TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION FIELD: POST-SIGNATURE CODE  
   -A- CONDITION: CONTAINS
   -A- EQUALS: TASK^TIUTIUS(DA)
  
   -B- SEARCH FOR TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION FIELD: 
  
 IF: A//    
 POST-SIGNATURE CODE EQUALS (case-insensitive) ("TASK"_$C(94)_"TI
 UTIUS(DA)")
  
 STORE RESULTS OF SEARCH IN TEMPLATE: 
  
 Sort by: NAME// 
 Start with NAME: FIRST// 
 First Print FIELD: NAME  
 Then Print FIELD: 
 Heading (S/C): TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION Search  Replace 
 DEVICE:   HOME  (CRT)    Right Margin: 80// 
  
 Modify each Document Definition listed to update the POST-SIGNATURE CODE
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch. Because this patch contains Option file 
 changes and changes to fields in file #8925.71, back-out must be done 
 with the participation of the sustainment team.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines plus the Option and File 
 changes.  Because there is no current option to backup the option/file 
 changes, please call the national help desk or enter a help desk ticket.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum(s) of 
 the routine(s) matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch description.
  
 No patient data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no
 rollback strategy is required.
