 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================
 1. INC000000620409 - some note titles show names two ways <xxx> and 
                      some don't, is there a fix?
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When selecting a New Note from the Notes tab in CPRS, several progress 
   note titles appear twice in sequence: once in the form TITLE, and once
   in the form TITLE <TITLE>.  This is redundant and confusing for users.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Changed the indexing routine TIUDD1 so that each full title appears 
   only once.
  
   Technical:
   ---------
   Abbreviations and Print Names which are not identical to the Name of 
   the progress note will still appear separately.  This fix to routine
   TIUDD1 prevents an Abbreviation or Print Name which is exactly the same
   as the Name from appearing a second time.
  
   This issue will be corrected with post-install routine TIU10278 which
   will be deleted after running.
  
  
 2. INC000000226367  - Spelling error in TIU Template Field (VANOD skin 
                       template)
  
   Problem:
   -------
   There is a spelling error in the ITEMS section of the TIU TEMPLATE 
   FIELD file (#8927.1) for the template "JJS WA BS ACT".  The phrase
   "Walks Frequently" is spelled "Walks Freguently".
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Corrected the spelling error, if the error is present in the installing 
   environment.
  
   Technical:
   ---------
   This issue will be corrected with post-install routine TIU10278 which
   will be deleted after running.
