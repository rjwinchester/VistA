Subject: TIU FIXES FOR PHILIPPINES ADDRESSES, DATE RANGE RESETS, & MISSING PATCH LIST

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following 3 issues:
  
 1. Date range search options in Text Integration (TIU) functions will
    reset the date range.
 2. Incorrect Philippines address format makes province and postal code not
    display in the patient address.
 3. Routine TIUSRVR2 does not contain reference to TIU*1*211 on the 2nd 
    line

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1. INC00000163940 - Document list resets, unexpected
  
   Problem:
   --------
   Date range search options in TIU functions will reset the date range
   'End' date to today when refreshing and returning to the original list
   display.  I.e., when a user selects a date range (in the past) using TIU
   Reporting functions, a list of documents matching that date range will
   be displayed.  After selecting and browsing any of the notes on the list
   and then returning to the date range list, the list is rebuilt with the
   original 'From' date but with an incorrect 'End' date of the current 
   day.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Routines TIUR, TIURM, TIURPTTL, TIURTITL have been modified to rebuild
   the date range correctly upon returning to the date range display.
  
  
 2. INC000000980011 - Text Integration Utility - Other
  
   Problem:
   --------
   Patients with a Philippines address have an incorrect address format 
   printed when using the TIU Object - VA-WRIISC ADDRESS.  A Philippines 
   address uses province and postal code instead of state and zip.  
   The province and postal code are not showing with the patient address.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Routine TIUWRIIS has been modified to correctly format the Philippines 
   addresses to use province instead of state and postal code instead of 
   zip.  
  
  
 3. INC000000211841 - 2nd line of TIUSRVR2 missing associated patch 
                      TIU*1*211
   Problem:
   --------
   The routine TIUSRVR2, included in patch TIU*1.0*211, does not contain
   211 in the patch list on the 2nd line of the routine.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Added 211 to the 2nd line of routine TIUSRVR2 to comply with Standards
   and Conventions Committee (SACC) standards.
