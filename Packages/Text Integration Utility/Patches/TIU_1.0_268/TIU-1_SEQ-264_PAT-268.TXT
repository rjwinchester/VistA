 NEW SERVICE REQUEST OVERVIEW:
 =============================
 N/A
  
  
 This patch contains three edited routines.
   
      ROUTINES:
      ---------
      TIUSRVA - This routine is the execution routine for the TIU
                AUTHORIZATION RPC.  It was modified as part of solution
                for Remedy ticket INC000000337461.
      TIUSRVLO - Server fns - lists for CPRS.  This routine was modified
                 to resolve a <FRAMESTACK> error caused by missing index
                 intries in ^TIUP(8925,"DAD") when selecting a note in
                 CPRS.
      TIUSRVLP - Server fns - Cont of TIUSRVLO.  This routine was modified
                 to resolve a <FRAMESTACK> error caused by missing index
                 intries in ^TIUP(8925,"DAD") when selecting a note in
                 CPRS.
   
  
 The following Remote Procedure will be added:
  
      Name                  Description
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      TIU CAN PRINT         This RPC evaluates whether a user can print a
         WORK/CHART COPY    Document, and if so, whether the user can print
                            only a Work Copy or may print EITHER a Work
                            Copy or a Chart Copy.
  
    
 DEFECT TRACKING SYSTEM TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================================
 1. INC000000487187 - 3 Work Chart Issue 
   
    Problem:
    --------
    When CPRS v28 (OR*3.0*280) was released, it modified the ability to
    print Chart Copies of Discharge Summaries.  This modification has caused
    the parameter "ALLOW CHART PRINT OUTSIDE MAS" to not be honored properly
    and users were being provided an opportunity to print a Chart Copy when
    they should not have been.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modifications to TIUSRVA are being made, as well as the new TIU CAN
    PRINT WORK/CHART COPY remote procedure (RPC) call being introduced to
    provide proper control of the ability to print Work and Chart Copies of
    Discharge Summaries.  CPRS v30 (OR*3.0*350) will complete this solution
    by implementing the new RPC to be used in the controlling of the
    appropriate authorization to the ability to print Work and/or Chart
    Copies of Discharge Summary via the CPRS GUI.
  
   
 2. INC000000337461 - Additional Signer prompting for a cosigner when set as
                      a surrogate
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Additional signer prompting for a cosigner when set as a surrogate.
    When a user who requires a cosigner is defined as a surrogate for an
    additional signer of a document the user cannot sign it using CPRS and
    receives the message message "You must name a cosigner before signing
    this document."  In roll/scroll this message is not encountered and a
    surrogate for an additional signer can sign it.  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the RPC TIU Authorization routine (TIUSRVA) to check if the
    user is a surrogate for an additional signer and if so allow processing
    to continue and not encounter the error message.
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 -------------------------------------------------- 
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) address as directed by the CPRS
 Implementation team. Installation instructions will be distributed when
 your site begins the implementation process.
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at:
 http://www4.domain.ext/vdl/
  
 The updated documentation will not be on the vdl until after the phased
 deployment has completed.
  
 Patch Installation:
 =================== 
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.30.b Installation Guide" for installation 
 and set-up information. This document is exported as OR_30_350_IG.doc and
 OR_30_350_IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_350.ZIP and will be emailed to 
 the installation point of contacts by the CPRS Implementation team.
  
 Installation of these host files must be coordinated among the personnel 
 affected because these host files will be installed in one installation 
 session.
