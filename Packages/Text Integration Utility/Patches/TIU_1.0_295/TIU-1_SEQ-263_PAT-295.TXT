 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================
 1. INC000000427368
  
   Problem:
   --------
   In certain situations, re-assigning a TIU document must be accomplished 
   twice in order for it to be successful.  When the document being
   reassigned has the TIU Document Parameter 'ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS'
   set to YES & the visit type is A, I, or T and the document is not set to
   CREDIT STOP CODE ON COMPLETION the defer logic is called which causes no
   visit record to be created although it does set CREDIT STOP CODE ON
   COMPLETION which allows the next effort to reassign the document to
   complete successfully.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The defer logic in TIUPXAP1 is being modified with this patch to not 
   execute when it is called from the reassign routine TIURD3.  This is
   done by passing a variable (TIUREASS) from routine TIURD3 to TIUPXAP1.
  
  
 2. INC000001251478
  
   Problem:
   --------
   Site reported receiving the error message "Error Getting reply from DoD"
   when attempting to pull patient records in VistA Web.  It was determined
   that an error was occurring in station 200 when TIU RPC 'TIU GET RECORD
   TEXT' was called with variable TIUDA = null.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   There is existing logic in TIUSRVR1 that is located too low in the 
   routine to prevent this error. This patch moves this logic in the 
   Routine up several lines where it should have been located originally
   thus preventing this error from occurring.
