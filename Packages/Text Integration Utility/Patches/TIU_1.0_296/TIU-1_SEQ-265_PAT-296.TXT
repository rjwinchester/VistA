Description:
============

 Patch TIU*1*296 modifies the Text Integration Utilities (TIU) application 
 to send a TIU alert to the appropriate service provider(s) immediately
 after a staff member screens a patient and signs the associated note. This
 functionality is needed so that after staff members have screened patients
 for potential risks (weight loss or gain, homelessness, substance abuse,
 etc.), the service provider(s) will be alerted prior to the note being
 co-signed by the licensed clinician responsible for reviewing and
 approving the note. Prior to this modification, TIU alerts were not sent
 to all service providers. This resulted in missed opportunities to provide
 needed services for patients while the patients are on site, and forced
 staff to take time to contact patients and reschedule needed services.
  
 This patch utilizes one new file (TIU TEXT EVENTS (#8925.71)) used to 
 define the words or phrase that will be searched for in a TIU document 
 (progress note, consult, etc.). If the words or phrase are found in the 
 TIU document, then an alert is sent to the team specified in the TIU TEXT 
 EVENTS file.
  
 One new menu option-Text Event Edit [TIU TEXT EVENT EDIT]-will be added to
 the TIU Maintenance Menu [TIU IRM MAINTENANCE MENU]. This option is used
 only to set up a text event in the TIU TEXT EVENTS file.
  
 IMPORTANT: Any TIU document that is to be used for these alerts MUST have 
 the MUMPS code 'D TASK^TIUTIUS(DA)' entered in the POST-SIGNATURE CODE 
 (#4.9) field in the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION (#8925.1) file.
  
 The NSR for this intake addresses the following requirements:
 VHBAO: NEED2949: Provide the ability for users to send TIU text alerts
 created by non-clinical staff in CPRS to service providers before being
 co-signed by a licensed clinician.
  
 This intake has been implemented locally at the Clement J. Zablocki
 VA Medical Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and is an enhancement to an
 existing web application/service.
