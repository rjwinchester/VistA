I10273633FY16 - Exact same note appearing on two different charts.
"BLD",10340,1,22,0)
  
"BLD",10340,1,23,0)
Problem: 
"BLD",10340,1,24,0)
========
"BLD",10340,1,25,0)
The same consult note is documented in the correct patient chart as well
"BLD",10340,1,26,0)
as an incorrect patient chart, due to an incorrect consult number and an
"BLD",10340,1,27,0)
incorrect parameter value used when uploading the note through TIU.  It
"BLD",10340,1,28,0)
was determined that this is a result of post install instructions for
"BLD",10340,1,29,0)
patch TIU*1.0*131 not being followed leaving the TIU DOCUMENT 
"BLD",10340,1,30,0)
DEFINITIONS Progress Notes and Consults records with incorrect values in
"BLD",10340,1,31,0)
field 4.8 (UPLOAD FILING ERROR CODE).  The upload would not be filed and
"BLD",10340,1,32,0)
generate an error instead had the post install instructions for patch
"BLD",10340,1,33,0)
TIU*1.0*131 been completed.

Resolution:
"BLD",10340,1,36,0)
===========
"BLD",10340,1,37,0)
This patch will run a post install routine.  The post install routine
"BLD",10340,1,38,0)
will review the PROGRESS NOTES class and CONSULTS document class (or
"BLD",10340,1,39,0)
CONSULTS class) and all entries within them in the TIU Document 
"BLD",10340,1,40,0)
Definitions file (8925.1). 
"BLD",10340,1,41,0)
 
"BLD",10340,1,42,0)
The details of the install routine are as follows:
"BLD",10340,1,43,0)
 - If the current value of the UPLOAD FILING ERROR CODE (field 4.8) for
"BLD",10340,1,44,0)
   PROGRESS NOTES (and all document definitions under it) equals the
"BLD",10340,1,45,0)
   pre-patch TIU*1.0*131 value of "D GETPN^TIUCHLP" it will be changed to 
"BLD",10340,1,46,0)
   "D PNFIX^TIUPNFIX" (if the record is not locked).
"BLD",10340,1,47,0)
 - If the current value of the UPLOAD FILING ERROR CODE (field 4.8) 
"BLD",10340,1,48,0)
   for CONSULTS (and all document definitions under it) equals the
"BLD",10340,1,49,0)
   pre-patch TIU*1.0*131 value of "D GETPN^TIUCHLP" it will be changed to
"BLD",10340,1,50,0)
   "D CNFIX^TIUCNFIX" (if the record is not locked).
"BLD",10340,1,51,0)
 - If a record has the pre-patch TIU*1.0*131 value and cannot be updated 
"BLD",10340,1,52,0)
   due to being locked it will need to be manually corrected.

"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,37,0)
This patch will run a post install routine.  The post install routine
"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,38,0)
will review the PROGRESS NOTES class and CONSULTS document class (or
"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,39,0)
CONSULTS class) and all entries within them in the TIU Document 
"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,40,0)
Definitions file (8925.1). 
"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,41,0)
 
"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,42,0)
The details of the install routine are as follows:
"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,43,0)
 - If the current value of the UPLOAD FILING ERROR CODE (field 4.8) for
"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,44,0)
   PROGRESS NOTES (and all document definitions under it) equals the
"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,45,0)
   pre-patch TIU*1.0*131 value of "D GETPN^TIUCHLP" it will be changed to 
"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,46,0)
   "D PNFIX^TIUPNFIX" (if the record is not locked).
"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,47,0)
 - If the current value of the UPLOAD FILING ERROR CODE (field 4.8) 
"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,48,0)
   for CONSULTS (and all document definitions under it) equals the
"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,49,0)
   pre-patch TIU*1.0*131 value of "D GETPN^TIUCHLP" it will be changed to
"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,50,0)
   "D CNFIX^TIUCNFIX" (if the record is not locked).
"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,51,0)
 - If a record has the pre-patch TIU*1.0*131 value and cannot be updated 
"PKG",470,22,1,"PAH",1,1,52,0)
   due to being locked it will need to be manually corrected.
