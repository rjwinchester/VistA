 CA SDM Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 I10273633FY16 - Exact same note appearing on two different charts.
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 The same consult note is documented in the correct patient chart as well
 as an incorrect patient chart, due to an incorrect consult number and an
 incorrect parameter value used when uploading the note through TIU. It
 was determined that this is a result of post install instructions for
 patch TIU*1.0*131 not being followed leaving the TIU DOCUMENT 
 DEFINITIONS Progress Notes and Consults records with incorrect values in
 field #4.8 (UPLOAD FILING ERROR CODE). The upload would not be filed and
 generate an error instead had the post install instructions for patch
 TIU*1.0*131 been completed.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 This patch will run a post install routine. The post install routine
 will review the PROGRESS NOTES class and CONSULTS document class (or
 CONSULTS class) and all entries within them in the TIU DOCUMENT 
 DEFINITIONS file (#8925.1). 
  
 The details of the install routine are as follows:
  - If the current value of the UPLOAD FILING ERROR CODE (field #4.8) for
    PROGRESS NOTES (and all document definitions under it) equals the
    pre-patch TIU*1.0*131 value of "D GETPN^TIUCHLP" it will be changed to 
    "D PNFIX^TIUPNFIX" (if the record is not locked).
  - If the current value of the UPLOAD FILING ERROR CODE (field #4.8) for
    CONSULTS (and all document definitions under it) equals the
    pre-patch TIU*1.0*131 value of "D GETPN^TIUCHLP" it will be changed to
    "D CNFIX^TIUCNFIX" (if the record is not locked).
  - If a record has the pre-patch TIU*1.0*131 value and cannot be updated 
    due to being locked it will need to be manually corrected.
  
 The below example information will be included in the patch INSTALL file
 entry for historical purposes, and also in the mail message to any user
 defined as a member of VistA mail groups 'PATIENT SAFETY NOTIFICATIONS' and 
 'TIU CACS' and to the user running the installation.  
  
   This patch reviews field #4.8 (UPLOAD FILING ERROR CODE) in the TIU 
   DOCUMENT DEFINITIONS file for document classes and titles belonging to
   CONSULTS and PROGRESS NOTES and are addressed as follows: 
     1.  CONSULTS with the pre-patch TIU*1.0*131 value of 'D GETPN^TIUCHLP'
         are changed to 'D CNFIX^TIUCNFIX'
     2.  PROGRESS NOTES with the pre-patch TIU*1.0*131 value of 
         'D GETPN^TIUCHLP' are changed to 'D PNFIX^TIUPNFIX'.  
     3.  Any CONSULTS or PROGRESS NOTES with field #4.8 without a value
         are not changed.
     4.  Any CONSULTS or PROGRESS NOTES with the pre-patch TIU*1.0*131 value
         of 'D GETPN^TIUCHLP' that are locked during the install NEED TO BE 
         MANUALLY UPDATED using option TIU UPLOAD PARAMETER EDIT.
     5.  Any document definitions with a value other than 'D GETPN^TIUCHLP'
         are not updated.
  
   **IMPORTANT NOTE**  The 'Enhanced Mismatched Consults List' [TIU144
   ENHANCED MISMATCH LIST] should be run regularly. Please take a moment now 
   to run it and create a reminder in your calendar to run it again every 6 
   months. If there are any mismatches, submit a help desk ticket for 
   assistance resolving them.
