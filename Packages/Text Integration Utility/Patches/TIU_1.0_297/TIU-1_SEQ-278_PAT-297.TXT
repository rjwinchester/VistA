Description:
============

 TIU*1.0*297 modifies the Text Integration Utilities (TIU) application. 
  
 This patch addresses NSR # 20140809 (Prevention of Unauthorized
 Abbreviations in the TIU Screen) and NSR # 20141003 (TIU Dictation
 Control). Detailed descriptions for each of these NSRs are listed below. 
  
 This patch also addresses a minor issue identified with Patch TIU*1.0*296
 in which the new TIU Event Edit [TIU TEXT EVENT EDIT] option only allows
 users with at-sign (@)-Programmer access in VistA to add/update/delete
 entries in the TIU TEXT EVENTS File (#8925.71).
  
 ***** Please Note the Following ******* 
 Per management guidelines, the functionality in NSR #20140809 and
 #20141003 is optional and upon release of the patch, it should be in an
 inactive or disabled state. This allows facilities that choose not to use
 this functionality, to only be required to install the patch. In other
 words the corresponding functionality will continue to act the same
 as it did prior to the installation of this patch with no changes. Any
 facility that wants to use the functionality of the NSRs must activate the
 functionality as defined in the post installation instructions.
 **************************************
  
 NSR #20140809 - Prevention of Unauthorized Abbreviations in the TIU Screen
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Problem:
   --------
   Currently Unauthorized Abbreviations, such as those on The Joint 
   Commission "Do Not Use" list, can be used in the progress note within
   the TIU application without any alert to the note author. 
  
   Solution:
   ---------
   Once the new "TIU Unauthorized Abbreviation" application is activated,
   it will prevent a NOTE from being signed unless each unauthorized
   abbreviation has been removed or spelled out.
  
   USE OF THIS FUNCTIONALITY IS OPTIONAL. Work with your facility Chief,
   Health Information Management (HIM) and Chief of Staff to determine
   whether this functionality should be turned on.
  
   A newly created "TIU Unauthorized Abbreviation" File (#8927.9) contains
   a standard set of fourteen unauthorized abbreviations from The Joint
   Commission. Staff may add additional abbreviation(s) to match any 
   unauthorized abbreviations that they have identified in local policy.
  
   A newly created menu option "Unauthorized Abbreviations (Enter/Edit)"
   [TIU ABBV ENTER EDIT] maintains unauthorized abbreviation data in the
   "TIU Unauthorized Abbreviation" File (#8927.9).  Another newly created
   menu option "List Unauthorized Abbreviations" [TIU ABBV LIST] lists all
   the abbreviations in File (#8927.9).  These two new options are located
   under the existing "TIU Maintenance Menu" [TIU IRM MAINTENANCE MENU].
  
   This patch will deploy all fourteen abbreviations with STATUS field set 
   to "Inactive." This application can be activated by updating an
   abbreviation to a STATUS of "Active." If any identified abbreviation
   is found and listed in the File (#8927.9) with ACTIVE STATUS, the
   abbreviation will be listed in the CPRS "Insufficient Authorization"
   box. The Note cannot be signed by the staff unless each identified
   unauthorized abbreviation has been removed or spelled out.
  
   Select OPTION NAME: TIU MAINTENANCE MENU      TIU IRM MAINTENANCE MENU
      10     Unauthorized Abbreviations (Enter/Edit)
      11     List Unauthorized Abbreviations
  
   The Unauthorized Abbreviations (Enter/Edit) option allows facility staff
   to enter/edit their own unauthorized abbreviation(s) into the "TIU 
   UNAUTHORIZED ABBREVIATION" File (#8927.9). When facility staff creates a
   new entry, the field default settings will be as follows:
          *  The CLASS  Field (#.02) is defaulted to "LOCAL".
          *  The ABBREVIATION EXACT MATCH Field (#.03) is defaulted
             to "YES".
          *  The STATUS Field (#.04) is defaulted to "ACTIVE".
          *  The NOTE Field (#.05) is optional.
   Staff can only edit the entries for ABBREVIATION EXACT MATCH, STATUS and
   NOTE if the CLASS field is set to "LOCAL." If the CLASS field is set
   to "NATIONAL", then no entry can be edited at the facility level.
  
   The List Unauthorized Abbreviations option displays a list of existing
   unauthorized abbreviations in the Unauthorized Abbreviations File
   (#8927.9), either active abbreviations only or active and inactive
   abbreviations.
  
   Requirements for the "Unauthorized Abbreviations (Enter/Edit)" are:
  
   1) Fourteen Unauthorized Abbreviations from the Joint Commission listing
      are released in the "TIU UNAUTHORIZED ABBREVIATION" File (#8927.9)  
      with CLASS Field (#.02) set to "LOCAL", "ABBREVIATION EXACT MATCH"  
      Field (#.03) set to "YES", and the STATUS Field (#.04) set to 
      "INACTIVE". The fourteen Unauthorized Abbreviations are:
      "IU, MgSO4, MS, MSO4, QD, Q.D., qd, q.d., QOD, Q.O.D., qod, q.o.d.,
      U, u".
  
   2) Any Unauthorized Abbreviation(s) entry with CLASS Field (#.02)
      set to "NATIONAL" cannot be added or modified by facility staff. 
      In this release, no entry is released with "NATIONAL" CLASS.
  
   3) No Unauthorized Abbreviation entry can be deleted once it is created.
  
   4) The UNAUTHORIZED ABBREVIATION at field (#.01) cannot be changed or
      deleted once it is created, but STATUS Field (#.04) can be change to
      either ACTIVE or INACTIVE.
  
   5) The UNAUTHORIZED ABBREVIATION Field (#.01) is prohibited from 
      including the following punctuations: |^&~\:;,!?
  
   6) The UNAUTHORIZED ABBREVIATION Field (#.01) is not case sensitive.
  
   7) The requirement for case sensitivity check for an Unauthorized 
      Abbreviation entry is determined by the "ABBREVIATION EXACT MATCH"
      Field (#.03).
  
   8) Once a new Unauthorized Abbreviation entry is created, "ABBREVIATION
      EXACT MATCH" Field (#.03) is defaulted to "YES". Staff can change
      the value in this field.
  
   9) The CLASS (#.02), ABBREVIATION EXACT MATCH (#.03), STATUS (#.04), 
      and NOTE (#.05) fields are audited using FileMan options.
  
   10) If CLASS Field (#.02) is set to "NATIONAL", Facility staff cannot
       change any Unauthorized Abbreviation entry. On the other hand,
       if CLASS Field (#.02) set to "LCOAL", the Facility staff can 
       add/modify/activate/inactivate the Unauthorized Abbreviation entry
       from field (#.03) to field (#.05) regardless of the STATUS value.
     
   11) An Unauthorized Abbreviation entry with CLASS field set to "LOCAL"
       can be managed by facility staff to serve any general medical and
       business practice need. Facility staff can inactivate these entries
       when an unauthorized abbreviation is no longer needed. (For example,
       MS may be an abbreviation for Multiple Sclerosis or Mitral Stenosis,
       or an abbreviation for Mississippi to obtain discount mailing bulk
       rate. U may be an abbreviation for U Street Corridor which is a
       commercial and residential district in Northwest Washington DC.)
  
   CAUTION: Any Abbreviation which is listed with ACTIVE STATUS in the 
   "TIU UNAUTHORIZED ABBREVIATION" File (#8927.9) will be checked against
   an entire progress note including any credentials and street address.
   Thus, if a progress note contains any abbreviation which is listed 
   with ACTIVE STATUS in the File (#8927.9), the NOTE cannot be signed
   unless each identified abbreviation is either removed or spelled out.
  
 NSR #20141003 - TIU Dictation Control
 -------------------------------------
   Problem
   -------
   Many medical centers have been having problems with students, residents,
   and other providers dictating progress notes and failing to supply all
   of the necessary information such as note title, associated visit, etc.
   This patch addresses this issue by introducing functionality which will
   allow a facility to control TIU dictation privileges for TIU documents
   of any type (Op reports, DC Summaries, Consults, etc.). Dictating
   authors should initiate a note stub and dictate a unique ID number with
   dictation instructions. The unique ID number is generated by the 
   system. It is normally not disclosed to the user. However, in this case,
   it is disclosed as part of the dictation instructions, for easy 
   identification.
   
   USE OF THIS FUNCTIONALITY IS OPTIONAL.  Work with your facility Chief, 
   and Health Information Management (HIM) to discuss the functionality
   this patch provides and whether it should be turned on.
  
   Dictation privileges are controlled by two new fields in the
   "TIU PARAMETERS" File (#8925.99). The fields are:
      1) ENABLE DICTATION CONTROL Field (#.23) can be answered YES to
         enable the patch functionality. Entry of NO or nothing will
         disable the functionality.
      2) DICTATION INSTRUCTIONS Field (#6) is a word processing field. It 
         allows sites to enter site-specific dictation instructions. Within
         this field, sites may reference the variables TIUDA, TIUL5, and
         TIUINST by placing them between vertical bars, Example |TIUDA|.
         TIUDA is the internal entry number of the current document,
         TIUL5 is the last 5 digits of TIUDA, and TIUINST is the internal
         entry number of the INSTITUTION of the current logged-in user.
         Kernel's software-wide variables which are defined in the
         Kernel technical manual, and FileMan's package-wide variables
         which are defined in the FileMan technical manual, may be used
         as well.
  
   The security key, TIUDCT, must be assigned to the CPRS users
   who are authorized to dictate TIU Documents, and transcription
   personnel such as the Facility Chief HIM and the Transcription
   Supervisor/Staff.
  
   These two new fields (#.23 and #6) in the "TIU PARAMETERS" File
   (#8925.99) can be modified by using the "TIU BASIC PARAMETERS EDIT"
   option. Since the "TIU PARAMETERS" File (#8925.99) is based on the
   INSTITUTION File (#4), the "Enable Dictation Control" Field (#.23)
   can either enabled or disabled this "Dictation Control" functionality
   at the site's division level.
  
   By entering "BEGIN-DICTATION" on the first line of the progress
   note then "Save Without Signature", the text of the note will be
   immediately replaced with the text in the "DICTATION INSTRUCTIONS"
   Field (#6) in the "TIU PARAMETERS" File (#8925.99).  
  
 Issue identified with Patch TIU*1.0*296:
 ------------------------------------------
   Patch TIU*1*296 modified the Text Integration Utilities (TIU) 
   application to send a TIU alert to the appropriate service provider(s)
   immediately after a staff member screens a patient and signs the
   associated note. The patch added the TIU TEXT EVENTS File (#8925.71) to
   allow the facility to define the words or phrase that will be searched
   for in a TIU document (progress note, consult, etc.). If the words or
   phrase are found in the TIU document, an alert is sent to the team
   specified in the TIU TEXT EVENTS File (#8925.71).
  
   Problem:
   --------
   Patch TIU*1.0*296 exported the new TIU Event Edit [TIU TEXT EVENT EDIT]
   option which allows file add/update/delete functionality for the TIU
   TEXT EVENTS File (#8925.71). This option only allowed a user with
   at-sign (@)-Programmer access in VistA to add/update/delete entries
   in this file. Sites require Informatics staff who do not have the
   at-sign (@)-Programmer access, have this option for file updates.
  
   Solution:
   ---------
   The TIU Event Edit [TIU TEXT EVENT EDIT] option has been updated and is 
   being deployed to allow Informatics staff, who do not have the at-sign
   (@)-Programmer access, to add/update/delete entries in the TIU TEXT
   EVENTS File (#8925.71).

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
    1. After this TIU*1*297 patch is installed successfully, please make
       sure that the Post-Installation routine, TIUPS297, is removed.
  
    2. If your site wants to use the new functionality implemented for NSR
       # 20140809 (Prevention of Unauthorized Abbreviations in the TIU
       Screen), the following should be done for any abbreviations decided
       upon by the site:
           a. Determine which of the following provided fourteen
              Unauthorized Abbreviations from The Joint Commission listing
              are to be required at your site: IU, MgSO4, MS, MSO4, QD,
              Q.D., qd, q.d., QOD, Q.O.D., qod, q.o.d., U, u
           b. Determine if your site has any additional abbreviation 
              that it would like to be included to prevent usage by users.
           c. Utilize the Unauthorized Abbreviations (Enter/Edit) [TIU ABBV
              ENTER EDIT] option found on the TIU Maintenance Menu [TIU IRM
              MAINTENANCE MENU] to do the following:
                   1. Set the STATUS field to "Active" for each of the 
                      Unauthorized Abbreviations, from The Joint Commission
                      listing, that you prefer to prevent from being used
                      at your site.
                   2. Enter any new Unauthorized Abbreviation that you
                      prefer to prevent at your site.
  
    3. If your site wants to use the new functionality implemented for 
       NSR #20141003 (TIU Dictation Control), the following should be done:
           a. User can use the "Basic TIU Parameters" option [TIU BASIC
              PARAMETER EDIT] to enable/disable the "Dictation Control"
              functionality, and create "Dictation Instruction" as 
              appropriate for your site. Please note that the
              "TIU PARAMETERS" File (#8925.99) is defined to have one
              entry for each division.  It will require this step to be
              done for each division using this functionality. This
              facilitates usage and/or dictation instructions to be defined
              by division as needed at multi-divisional facilities.
           b. Assign the TIUDCT security key to anyone who will need to
              dictate TIU documents using CPRS.
      If your site does not want to use this functionality, no action is
      required.
  
 Back Out Instructions for Patch TIU*1.0*297
 -------------------------------------------
  
 In the event a site determines that this patch should be backed out, the 
 site should submit a CA SDM ticket with the NSD for assistance with the 
 procedure. Refer to the Deployment, Installation, Back-Out, and Rollback 
 Guide (DIBORG), tiu_1_0_297_ig.pdf, information regarding back out
 of the software.
