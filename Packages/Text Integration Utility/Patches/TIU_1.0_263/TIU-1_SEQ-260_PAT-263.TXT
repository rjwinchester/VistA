Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide
 (ICD-10_PROD_OVERVIEW_GUIDE_GROUPS_5_6_7.pdf) posted on the Anonymous
 directory for installation order. This is critical for proper 
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software. 
  
 This patch is part of the Computerized Patient Records System CPRSv30 
 project. This project will modify the Computerized Patient Record 
 System, Text Integration Utilities, Consults, Health Summary, Problem 
 List, Clinical Reminders, and Order Entry/Results Reporting to meet 
 the requirements proposed by the Dept. of Health and Human Services 
 to adopt ICD-10 code set standards for Clinic Orders.
  
 On January 16, 2009, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 
 released a final rule for replacing the 30-year-old ICD-9-CM code set 
 with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) and International Classification of Diseases, 
 Tenth Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) with dates of 
 service, or date of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or after the
 industry activation date. The classification system consists of more than
 68,000 codes, compared to approximately 13,000 ICD-9-CM codes.  There are
 nearly 87,000 ICD-10-PCS codes, while ICD-9-CM has nearly 3,800 procedure
 codes.  Both systems also expand the number of characters allotted from 
 five and four respectively to seven alpha-numeric characters.  This value 
 does not include the decimal point, which follows the third character for
 the ICD-10-CM code set.  There is no decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code 
 set.  These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of 
 care, so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better 
 understand complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and 
 better track the outcomes of care.  ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research.  
  
 NOTE: Functionality specific to activation of the ICD-10 code set shall 
 not be seen by end users until the code set has been activated.

 Changes Made to Accommodate ICD-10:
 -----------------------------------
  
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 In the past, a TIU Progress Note could be linked to particular problems 
 from the patient's Problem List using TIU VISTA.  These problems are 
 displayed in the "Associated Problems" section of the Detailed Display of
 the note.  This has generated the following needs for changes from TIU.
  
 Need: The List Manager actions that permit users to link problems 
 directly to a TIU Progress Note must be either updated to allow the 
 selection of ICD-9 or ICD-10 problems or the link action must be 
 discontinued.
  
 Resolution: TIU VISTA protocols permitting users to link problems 
 directly to a TIU Progress Note have been disabled.
 Disabled Protocols:
   TIU ACTION LINK TO PROBLEMS
   TIU ACTION MENU LINK TO PROBLEM
   TIU ACTION SELECT PROBLEM
   TIU BROWSE ACTION LINK TO PROBLEM
 Note: This means that all problems linked directly to Progress Notes will
 predate this patch and will therefore be ICD-9 problems.
  
  
 Need: The "Associated Problems" section of the Detailed Display of the
 note must indicate the coding system of the linked problems since there
 are now 2 possible coding systems.
  
 Resolution: The Detailed Display of the note has been altered to indicate 
 the code version of the linked problems.  The Detailed Display has been 
 changed for TIU VISTA and for the CPRS GUI.
  
 Need: PRINTING from the CPRS GUI of the Detailed Display of notes
 must indicate the coding system of the linked problems.
  
 Resolution: Such prints now indicate the coding system of the linked
 problems. 
  
 Need: Health Summaries from the CPRS GUI whose type includes the detailed
 display of a note must indicate the coding system of the linked
 problems.
  
 Resolution: Such Health Summaries now indicate the coding system of the 
 linked problems.
  
  
 Problem 2:
 ----------
 Need:  TIU List Manager (LM) Action Reassign is a manager action that is
 still in use. It creates a new TIU document, prompts the user for a visit,
 and then prompts the user for diagnoses for the visit.  In some 
 circumstances TIU code is invoked to prompt for diagnoses.  This TIU 
 code must be updated to use the appropriate coding version, ICD-9 or
 ICD-10.
  
 Resolution: The TIU process of prompting the user for diagnoses and
 storing them has been updated to use the correct code version.
  
  
  
 Problem 3:
 ---------- 
 Need:  TIU Object VA-WRIISC ACTIVE PROBLEMS must be updated to fetch and 
 display problems in their own coding system, ICD-9 or ICD-10.
  
 Resolution: 
 The object now displays problems in their own code version.
  
 NOTE:
 TIU Object VA-WRIISC ACTIVE PROBLEMS is the only nationally
 distributed TIU Object which includes Diagnoses/Problems.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 ClearQuest Ticket:
 1. HDS000021548 TIU Associated Problems on a PN contains lower case 
 icd-9-cm instead of caps
  
 Problem:
 -------
 This ClearQuest ticket is related to Problem 1 above, but concerns the 
 text of the Provider Narrative which in some cases may contain coding 
 system information as part of the Narrative itself. This information was
 indicated in lower case.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The coding system shown as part of the Provider Narrative is now 
 indicated in upper case. 
  
  
 2. HDS000021870 ICD10 IOC TIU reassign notes, no ICD-10 encounter form in 
 VistA
  
 Problem:
 -------
 In the ICD-10 Code System, when users reassigned a note and edited the
 encounter data for the destination visit, they were not presented with a
 list of diagnoses from the encounter form to choose from as they should
 have been.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The encounter form initially used to test with was faulty.  When using a
 correct form, testers were presented with the list of diagnoses.
  
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 Denver
 Madison
 Northampton
 Coatesville
 Orlando
  
  
  
 Documentation Retrieval Instructions
 ------------------------------------ 
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as 
 follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Hines          ftp.domain.ext   <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library
 at: http://www.domain.ext/vdl/
