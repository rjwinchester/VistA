Subject: INFORMATIONAL - VIE TO HEALTH CONNECT MIGRATION

Category: 
  - Informational
  - Other

Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
 This is an informational patch describing the migration from Vitria
 Interface Engine (VIE) to InterSystems Health Connect (HC). HC is a
 part of the suite of products grouped under HealthShare.
  
 This informational patch applies only for VistA sites that utilize the
 Remote Order Entry System (ROES)interface. Please disregard if your
 Site does NOT use Remote Order Entry System (ROES).(See live ROES Sites 
 below).
 **************************************************************************
    
 The Health Connect (HC) product will be replacing the Vitria Interface 
 Engine (VIE). During the transition phase, HC and VIE will be running 
 concurrently.
   
 The Remote Order Entry System (ROES) allows authorized individuals and
 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) clinicians to place orders online for
 products and/or services available through the VA Denver Acquisition &
 Logistics Center (DLC). The VIE enables the exchange of data between the 
 VistA sites and ROES to support the addition of CPRS notes based on 
 ROES actions. The ROES is located at DLC in Denver, CO and it
 exchanges Health Level Seven (HL7) messages with the VistA system at 
 various Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs). The flow of HL7 messages 
 and application acknowledgements (AAs) is bi-directional between these 
 systems using the VistA logical link TIUACKROES.  The HC software will 
 replace VIE to transmit these messages. Each VistA site utilizing the 
 notes interface from ROES will reconfigure the TIUACKROES logical link
 to point to the respective Regional Health Connect (HC) instead of VIE.

 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 -------------------------------------------------- 
 There is no VistA software being released for this migration. The 
 documentation describing this new functionality is available.
    
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
    
 Sites may retrieve the software documentation directly using Secure
 File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at
 the following OI Field Offices:
   
 Hines          domain.ext
 Salt Lake City domain.ext
   
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at: http://www.domain.ext/vdl/
   
 The documentation will be in the form of Adobe Acrobat files.

 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
  
 **************************************************************************
 The following instructions are to be performed only when directed to do so 
 by the Healthshare National Admin Team. These changes can only be 
 implemented in collaboration and coordination with Implementation Support, 
 Clinical Product Support and Healthshare National Admin Team. 
 **************************************************************************
  
 After HealthShare's Health Connect (HC) is deployed, and the HC
 Regional Production instance is ready to process incoming and outgoing 
 messages, the site administrator will need to edit the HL LOGICAL LINK file
 (#870) for the TIUACKROES entry. The VistA outbound logical link will need 
 to reference a TCP/IP address and port associated with the HL7 Listener 
 Service of the Regional Health Connect production.
 NOTE:
  (1) The Financial Admin Team will make the configuration change.
  (2) Prior to making any changes to the Logical Links as listed above, IO
 VistA Application Analyst should take screen shots of the logical Link
 configuration (FileMan Print Option, from File#870 HL LOGICAL 
 LINK, entry: TIUACKROES) prior to making any changes should a back out be
 required.
 The screen shots will be used to reference to restore prior
 configurations should it be necessary.
    
 The following steps will have to be performed in the VistA HL7 application 
 for TIUACKROES outbound link entry:
    
 Step 1.  Stop the TIUACKROES Logical Link using the HL7 Menu option: 
          Start/Stop Links. The following is an example:
    
    Select OPTION NAME: HL7 MAIN MENU  HL MAIN MENU     HL7 Main Menu
    
             Event monitoring menu ...
             Systems Link Monitor
             Filer and Link Management Options ...  <===
             Message Management Options ...
             Interface Developer Options ...
             Site Parameter Edit
      HLO    HL7 (Optimized) MAIN MENU ...
    
   Select HL7 Main Menu <TEST ACCOUNT> Option: FILER AND LINK Management 
                                               Options
    
    
      SM     Systems Link Monitor
      FL     Monitor, Start, Stop Filers
      LM     TCP Link Manager Start/Stop
      SA     Stop All Messaging Background Processes
      RA     Restart/Start All Links and Filers
      DF     Default Filers Startup
      SL     Start/Stop Links  <===
      PI     Ping (TCP Only)
      ED     Link Edit
      ER     Link Errors ...
    
   Select Filer and Link Management Options <TEST ACCOUNT> Option: sl  
                                                          
   This option is used to launch the lower level protocol for the
   appropriate device.  Please select the node with which you want
   to communicate
    
   Select HL LOGICAL LINK NODE: TIUACKROES
   The LLP was last started on MAR 07, 2019 12:17:34.
   
   Okay to shut down this job? YES
   The job for the TIUACKROES Lower Level Protocol will be shut down.
   
 STEP 2. Reset the TIUACKROES Logical Link  Queue Count (as instructed by 
 Enterprise HL7 Support Team on the call):
              HL7 Main Menu 
                FI Filer and Link Management Options
                 ER  Link Errors
                  RESET Link's Counters (TCP Only)
                   Select a TCP link:TIUACKROES
  
 Step 3. Edit the TIUACKROES Logical Link with the Link Edit HL7 menu
 option:
    
      SM     Systems Link Monitor
      FL     Monitor, Start, Stop Filers
      LM     TCP Link Manager Start/Stop
      SA     Stop All Messaging Background Processes
      RA     Restart/Start All Links and Filers
      DF     Default Filers Startup
      SL     Start/Stop Links
      PI     Ping (TCP Only)
      ED     Link Edit     <===
      ER     Link Errors ...
    
   Select HL LOGICAL LINK NODE:    TIUACKROES
    
 Step 4. On the first screen, change AUTOSTART to Enabled. 
    Next, move the cursor to the field LLP TYPE and press Enter. 
    This will present the second screen (as shown is step 5).
   
 Step 5. On the first screen, edit the DNS DOMAIN field as 
    instructed below.
     
                           HL7 LOGICAL LINK

 Step 6. Replace the existing TCP/IP ADDRESS with null and existing TCP/IP 
         PORT with the Health Connect IP address and port as shown:

 POST INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===============================
  
 STEP 7: Restart the TIUACKROES Logical Link use SL Start/Stop Links menu
 as shown in Step 1 above.
  
 STEP 8: Check/monitor the TIUACKROES Logical Link queues:
        a. Check STATUS (report if OPEN/FAIL or ERROR) using the SM 
           Systems Link Monitor menu option; 
        b. Check Queue Counts are the same for columns: TO SEND and SENT 
           using the SM Systems Link Monitor menu option;
        c. Check IP Address has filled in by performing a FileMan Inquiry 
           to File #870, HL LOGICAL LINK for the TIUACKROES Logical
           Link; or using:
              HL7 Main Menu 
                FI Filer and Link Management Options
                 ER  Link Errors
                  Display One Link (TCP Only)
                   Select a TCP link:TIUACKROES
  
 STEP 9: Monitor TIUACKROES Logical Link-using the SM Systems Link Monitor
 menu option. Report back on the call any issues.
