   Problem:
   --------
   Re-assigning a TIU document doesn't prompt the user to edit destination 
   encounter in some situations. When the document being reassigned has 
   the TIU Document Parameter 'ASK DX/CPT ON ALL OPT VISITS' set to YES 
   & the VISIT TYPE is A, I, or T (VISIT TYPE=SERVICE CATEGORY of the 
   VISIT; A=AMBULATORY, I=IN HOSPITAL, T=TELECOMMUNICATIONS) and the 
   document is not set to CREDIT STOP CODE ON COMPLETION, the user is not
   prompted to edit the DESTINATION encounter.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Modify the logic in QUE^TIUPXAP1 so that when it is called from the
   Reassign function (REASSIGO^TIURD3), the DEFER logic is executed and
   processing continues instead of exiting out of the routine. This will
   ensure that field .11 is set and the user will be prompted to edit the 
   DESTINATION encounter.
