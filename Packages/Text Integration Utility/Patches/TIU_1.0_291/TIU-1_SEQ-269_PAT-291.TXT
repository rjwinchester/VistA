 NEW SERVICE REQUEST OVERVIEW:
 =============================
 NSR #20080307     CWAD Post Auto-Demotion Rules Request
  
 CWAD is a section of CPRS used for posting progress notes, which are more
 important than standard level notes. These progress notes are made more
 easily available throughout CPRS. The postings dialog box can become
 cluttered with CWAD notes, resulting in the inability to easily distinguish
 important notes from less important notes. The requested enhancement is to
 demote previously designated notes from the CWAD postings to a regular
 note status when a newer CWAD note, of the same title, is written which
 supersedes the existing CWAD note(s). This is accomplished by converting
 an existing Class III application to Class I. A new parameter definition
 (TIU CWAD EXCLUDED TITLES) and three default parameter entries are
 included in this release as well as one new option (CWAD/Postings Auto-
 Demotion Setup [TIU CWAD AUTO-DEMOTION]). Two new routines will drive
 this new functionality.
  
 The TIU CWAD EXCLUDED TITLES parameter is used to prevent specific CWAD
 titles from being selected for auto-demotion. What is entered is the VHA
 Enterprise Standard Title from TIU VHA ENTERPRISE STANDARD TITLE (#8926.1)
 file. Any CWAD related title in the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION (#8925.1)
 file which is mapped to an excluded VHA Enterprise Standard Title will
 not be selectable as an auto-demotion CWAD title. At the guidance of the
 National Center for Ethics in Health Care, we are defaulting three VHA
 Enterprise Standard Titles to be excluded from the CWAD Auto-Demotion
 functionality. These are ADVANCE DIRECTIVE, ADVANCE DIRECTIVE
 DISCUSSION, and RESCINDED ADVANCE DIRECTIVE. These default parameter title
 entries should not be removed, modified, or overridden without prior 
 guidance.  
  
  
 Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 =====================================
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this
 patch is available. The preferred method is to retrieve files from 
 download.vista.domain.ext. This transmits the files from the first
 available server. Sites may also elect to retrieve files directly from a
 specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using Secure
 File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the
 following OI Field Offices:
  
 Albany:              domain.ext
 Hines:               domain.ext  
 Salt Lake City:      domain.ext

 Patch Installation:
 ===================
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 There are no Pre/Post install routines included with this patch. Site
 Clinical Application Coordinators and/or site designated personnel may
 configure CWAD notes for Auto-Demotion.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize potential
 disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes to install.
 There are no options to disable during this installation.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
    2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option 
    3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
       Installation Menu. From this menu, you may elect to use the following
       options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch
       TIU*1.0*291.
       a. Backup a Transport Global - May be skipped on initial installation
          as all routines are new. This option will create a backup message
          of any routines exported with this patch. It will not backup any
          other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow
          you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
          installed. It compares all components of this patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
          to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
          global.
    4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
       choose the patch to install.
    5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
       Install? YES//' answer Yes. You may answer No if your system rebuilds
       menu trees nightly using TaskMan. If you rebuild the menu trees during
       the installation, it could affect users on the system and the
       installation times will increase.
    6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//'
       answer No.
    7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//' answer No.
    8. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 After a successful installation, site Clinical Application Coordinators
 and/or site designated personnel may configure CWAD notes for Auto-Demotion
 utilizing the CWAD/Postings Auto-Demotion Setup [TIU CWAD AUTO-DEMOTION]
 option located on the Text Integration Utilities (MIS Manager) [TIU MAIN
 MENU MGR] menu option. 
 
 Prior to the actual CWAD/Postings Auto-Demotion Setup the site will need to
 determine the progress note title(s) to utilize as the "demoted" progress
 note title(s).  
 
 If the site does not wish to CREATE a new progress note title(s) for
 demoting a CWAD/Postings title(s), then select any existing non-CWAD
 title(s) (the title is not linked to a CWAD document class).
 
 If the site does wish to CREATE a new progress note title(s), the site will
 follow local policy for progress note creation. The Demoted Progress Note 
 Title must be under a non-CWAD document class but may be linked to the VHA 
 Enterprise Standard Title which matches the CWAD title being demoted.
 IE: DEMOTED CRISIS NOTE is mapped to the VHA Enterprise Standard Title of
 CRISIS NOTE.
 
 Below is an example of the CWAD/Postings Auto-Demotion Setup:
