Subject: TIU [TEXT INTEGRATION UTILITIES] INDEX DELETION ISSUES 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following 2 issues in the TIU package:
  
 1. When a transcriber changes an author for a note, some indexes are 
    incorrectly deleted, and the note will not display in custom views.
 2. Invalid unsaved document messages appear in Vista because only the 
    oldest index is deleted, instead of all indexes for the current user.

 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000069592 - Custom view shows transcriber for unsigned notes
    Duplicate: 
    INC000000070005 - Addendum showing unsigned for transcriptionist
                      on notes tab
    I9950239FY16    - Custom view shows transcriber for unsigned notes 
  
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 All notes for a transcriber are not displaying in a custom view of 
 unsigned notes after the author is changed using the change button.  
 When entering a note, if the author is edited using the CHANGE button in
 CPRS [Computerized Patient Record System] the original author is removed
 from the index before creating a new index for the new author.  
  
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
 Modify routine TIUDD01 so that the ACLAU index for the note is not 
 deleted when the value in the index matches the value in the ENTERED BY
 (#1302) field.
  
 2.  INC000000474971 - Issues with entering a TIU document
     Duplicate: 
     INC000000998485 - Chief of Staff cannot addend a completed C&P exam
  
 Problem 2:
 ----------
 Customer reports always receiving 'unsaved document' messages when 
 accessing some TIU (VistA Roll/Scroll) options.  The message reads:
  
      You have an unsaved document in your buffer.
      Depending on your preferred editor, you may
      have lost some of the text.
      Would you like to resume editing now? YES// 
  
 When the user answers YES, they received the message:
  
      You may not edit uncosigned or completed documents.
  
 The user is prompted to add an addendum and after responding NO, is then 
 returned to the previous menu and they receive the message:
  
      Okay. You can catch up with it later!
  
 This is due to an issue removing the ASAVE index when signing documents 
 in CPRS.
  
 Resolution 2:
 -------------
 Modify TIUEDI2 so that all unnecessary ASAVE indexes for the user are 
 deleted without any messages or prompts.  This will use the exact same 
 logic that currently exists in TIUEDI2 but reviews all of the ASAVE 
 indexes for the user instead of just the oldest.

 ========================== 
 It is not necessary to disable any options. It is recommended to install 
 this patch when users are off the system.  It should take less than 2
 minutes to install this patch.
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the

         a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
             transport global.
         b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
             the components of the KIDS build.
         c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when this 
             patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
             (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
         d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
      
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
      
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
      
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions
