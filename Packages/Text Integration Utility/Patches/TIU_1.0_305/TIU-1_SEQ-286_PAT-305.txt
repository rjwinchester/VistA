Description:
============

 TIU*1.0*305 provides the following enhancements to VistA:
  
 - Enables sites to add a progress note to the electronic record of all 
 inpatients and outpatients who were seen during computer system downtime 
 using the new option Contingency Downtime Bookmark Progress Notes [TIU 
 DOWNTIME BOOKMARK PN] in the TIU Maintenance Menu [TIU IRM MAINTENANCE 
 MENU]. The note must use a locally-approved title that has been mapped to
 the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) enterprise-standard COMPUTER
 DOWNTIME title. When creating the note, users can enter: the note title; 
 whether the computer downtime was scheduled or unscheduled; outage 
 start/end times; the author of the note; a date/time stamp to sequence 
 the note in the note tree; clinics to which the outage applies; users to 
 receive an email notification listing the patients affected and whether 
 the note was successfully appended to each patient's record; an option to 
 edit the TIU note text; and an electronic signature to perform an 
 administrative closure of the note to enter it into the medical record. 
 The progress note states that a computer outage occurred, and alerts the 
 user to search the patient's paper records for non-electronic 
 documentation created during the outage. The set-up and note content 
 should be coordinated with the Chief, Health Information Management at 
 each site. Only one progress note is filed for any patient with multiple 
 appointments (whether inpatient, outpatient, or both) at different 
 clinics during the outage period. Use of this functionality is optional 
 for each site.
  
 During the pre-installation phase, routine TIU1P305 checks the TIU 
 DOCUMENT DEFINITION file (#8925.1) to ensure that a local progress 
 note title is mapped to the enterprise-standard title COMPUTER DOWNTIME. A
 message appears if no mapping or incorrect mapping is found, though the
 patch installation continues. Note that the mapping issue must be resolved
 after patch installation. If the mapping to the title COMPUTER DOWNTIME 
 is correct, then no message is issued and the patch installation 
 continues.
  
 During the post-installation phase, routine TIU1P305 deletes a site's 
 existing text in the BOILERPLATE TEXT field (#3) in the TIU DOCUMENT 
 DEFINITION file (#8925.1) and replaces it with new standard TIU note 
 text. This new text can be modified by users when creating downtime 
 bookmark progress notes. The installation history for the patch will 
 capture the data from the BOILERPLATE TEXT field so that local Office of 
 Information and Technology (OIT) personnel can retrieve the previous 
 boilerplate text, if needed. The installation history can be reviewed 
 using the Install File Print [XPD PRINT INSTALL FILE] option under the 
 KIDS UTILITIES sub-menu.
  
 During the post-installation phase, routine TIU1P305 also attaches the 
 new option Contingency Downtime Bookmark Progress Notes [TIU DOWNTIME 
 BOOKMARK PN] to the TIU Maintenance Menu [TIU IRM MAINTENANCE MENU].
  
 - Enables clinicians and providers to create progress notes that 
 automatically generate a post-signature alert to designated recipients 
 based on the progress note title. The new option Create Post-Signature 
 Alerts [TIUFPC CREATE POST-SIGNATURE] in the Document Definitions 
 (Manager) [TIUF DOCUMENT DEFINITION MGR] menu allows Clinical Application 
 Coordinators (CACs) or other supervisors to define who is alerted when a 
 specific progress note title is used. The note title to define is 
 selected at the "Select TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION NAME:" prompt. The option 
 then enables entry of the recipients to be notified (individual, mail 
 group, or team list), whether to alert the Primary Care Provider, whether 
 to print a chart copy at the patient's location, and to optionally select 
 an output device for printing at another location. This data is used to 
 populate a MUMPS subroutine name in the POST-SIGNATURE ACTION field 
 (#4.9) for a document definition in the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file 
 (#8925.1). The notification is made through VistA Kernel Alerts and is 
 sent to recipients immediately upon a clinician's entry of an electronic 
 signature for the note. Use of this functionality is optional for each 
 site.
  
 During the post-installation phase, routine TIU1P305 attaches the new 
 option Create Post-Signature Alerts [TIUFPC CREATE POST-SIGNATURE] to the 
 Document Definitions (Manager) [TIUF DOCUMENT DEFINITION MGR] menu. 
 Routine TIU1P305 is deleted automatically at the end of patch 
 installation.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 Review the Pre-Installation Instructions provided before beginning 
 installation of the patch.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system, although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes 
 to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 To install the patch:
  
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) menu, 
 select the Installation Menu. From this menu, you may elect to use the 
 following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter the patch 
 number TIU*1.0*305.
  
    a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will help 
    ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
    b. Print Transport Global - This option will enable viewing the 
    components of the KIDS build.
  
    c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
    enable viewing all changes that will be made when this patch is
    installed. It compares all components of this patch (routines, data
    dictionaries, templates, etc.).
  
    d. Back up a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
    message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not back up
    any other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and 
 choose the patch to install.
  
 5. If prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
 Install? NO//', press <Enter>.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//', 
 press <Enter>.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
 Protocols? NO//', press <Enter>.
  
 8. If prompted 'Delay install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//', press <Enter>.
  
 9. If prompted 'Enter the Device you want to print the Install messages. 
 You can queue the install by enter a 'Q' at the device prompt. Enter a 
 '^' to abort the install. DEVICE: HOME//   HOME  (CRT)', press <Enter>.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:

 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of this patch, it is not recommended for 
 backout, and a restore from a backup of the Transport Global should not 
 be attempted. However, in the event that a site decides to back out this 
 patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit 
 a help desk ticket. The development team will need to issue one or more 
 follow-on patches in order to comprehensively back out this patch, after 
 coordination with the VA Project Manager and COR.
  
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the TIU routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the TIU routines have been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain 
 the designation of patch TIU*1.0*305 on line 2 in the patch list section. 
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out; it does not confirm that other patch component changes 
 have been backed out.
