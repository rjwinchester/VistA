 Problem:
 --------
 There exists a need to quantify VistA workload such that resource demand 
 can be determined for capacity planning of current and future VistA 
 deployments.
  
 Resolution:
 ---------
 The VistA System Monitor will collect Cache specific metrics in such a 
 way that they can be correlated with other tools gathering operating 
 system level metrics. Combined this will provide the ability to plan 
 future deployments based on current business workloads.
