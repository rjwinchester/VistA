 while the other three patches (PSO*7*427, IB*2*534, BPS*1*19) are being
 released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
 multi-build distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 6.0.  The two stand-alone 
 patches and multi-build distribution can be installed in any order and 
 do not need to installed at the same time.
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 1.  The VistA ePharmacy system is modified to support new data elements 
     for NCPDP versions E.0 through E.6.
  
     a.  The BPS NCPDP FIELD DEFS (#9002313.91) file was updated with new
         and modified NCPDP field information.
  
     b.  The BPS NCPDP REJECT CODES (#9002313.93) file with new and 
         modified NCPDP reject codes.
  
     c.  The claims submission process was updated to send data for new 
         NCPDP fields for which VistA has data to send.  In addition, some
         existing fields were updated to include additional NCPDP values.  
         The list of NCPDP fields that had modifications and also have 
         a major impact on NCPDP processing is below.

         393-MV - Benefit Stage Qualifier)
         339-6C - Other Payer ID Qualifier)
  
     d.  The claims response process was updated to include new NCPDP 
         fields and to process existing NCPDP fields that had changes to
         the data that can be returned by the third party payer.  The list
         of NCPDP fields that had modifications and also have a major
         impact on NCPDP processing is below.

 2.  The Close Claim [CLO] action on the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN]
     option was modified to prevent a claim from being closed if the
     claim has open rejects on the Pharmacist worklist.
  
 3.  The Rx Not Processed for Site bulletin was modified to direct the 
     user to the correct ECME option in order to get more information on
     the reject.
  
 4.  The Rx Not Processed for Site bulletin was modified to include the
     associated ECME number, if it exists.
  
 5.  The Claim Results and Status [BPS MENU RPT CLAIM STATUS] menu was 
     modified to include a new Non-Billable Status Report [BPS RPT
     NON-BILLABLE REPORT] option.  This new report will provide users with
     a tool to identify prescriptions that are not being billed and the
     reason the prescription was not billed.
  
 6.  If a TRICARE or CHAMPVA inpatient claim is reversed by the inpatient
     auto reversal process of the BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB, the
     transaction will be filed in the PSO AUDIT LOG (#52.87) file as a
     bypass prescription so that it will be displayed on the 
     TRICARE-CHAMPVA Bypass/Override Report, which is part of the
     Outpatient Pharmacy application.

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions
 ------------------------------------
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from
 ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.  This transmits the files from the first
 available FTP server.  Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly
 from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Hines          ftp.domain.ext   <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library
 at: http://www4.domain.ext/vdl/

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There is a pre-install routine associated with this patch named
 EN^BPS19PRE. The purpose of the pre install routine is to:
  
  a. Update NCPDP field definitions in BPS NCPDP FIELD DEFS (#9002313.91)
  
  b. Update the NCPDP reject codes/descriptions in BPS NCPDP REJECT CODES
     (#9002313.93).
  
 You may delete routine BPS19PRE if the installation was successful.
  
  
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named
 EN^BPS19PST. The purpose of the post install routine is to:
  
  a. Loop through the BPS REQUESTS (#9002313.77) entries and change the 
     OTHER PAYER AMT PAID QUALIFIER (#.02) field in the OTHER PAYER AMT
     PAID MULTIPLE (#9002313.7781) subfile from a set of codes to a
     pointer.
  
  b. Loop through the BPS TRANSACTION (#9002313.59) entries and change the
     OTHER PAYER AMT PAID QUALIFIER (#.02) field in the OTHER PAYER AMT
     PAID MULTIPLE (#9002313.59141) subfile from a set of codes to a
     pointer.
  
  c. Loop through the BPS LOG OF TRANSACTION (#9002313.57) entries and 
     change the OTHER PAYER AMT PAID QUALIFIER (#.02) field in the OTHER
     PAYER AMT PAID MULTIPLE (#9002313.57141) subfile from a set of codes
     to a pointer.
  
  d. Loop through the BPS CERTIFICATION (#9002313.31) entries and change 
     the OTHER PAYER AMT PAID QUALIFIER (#.02) field in the OTHER PAYER AMT
     PAID MULTIPLE (#9002313.31231) subfile from a set of codes to a
     pointer.
  
  e. Remove the BPS NCPDP FIELD CODES (#9002313.94) data and database
     definition.
  
 Depending on the number of records in the BPS TRANSACTION (#9002313.59),
 BPS LOG OF TRANSACTION (#9002313.57), and BPS CERTIFICATION (#9002313.31)
 files, the conversion of those files may take some time to run so this
 part of the post-install will be queued to run as a background
 post-install task. A mail message will be sent indicating the results of
 this portion of post-install process.
  
 You may delete routine BPS19PST if the installation was successful and
 the mailman message indicates that the post-install was successful.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed during non-peak
 hours when there is minimal activity on the system. Avoid times when ECME
 claims are being transmitted. Of particular concern are the options below.
  
     1. BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB]
        Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
        by the BPS Nightly Background Job option. Wait for this job to
        finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
  
     2. Scheduled CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED CS TRANS] and
        Scheduled Non-CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED NON-CS TRANS]
        Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
        transmitted to CMOP. Wait for the CMOP transmissions to finish
        or complete the installation before the transmissions start. Both
        the CS (Controlled Substances) and the non-CS CMOP transmission
        options should be checked. Check with Pharmacy Service or your
        Pharmacy ADPAC to find out when CMOP transmissions occur.
  
 This multi-build installation should take less than 5 minutes to 
 install.
  
 This multi-build installation can be queued but should not be queued at a 
 time when the BPS NIGHTY BACKGROUND JOB or CMOP transmission processes
 are scheduled.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
  
 1.  OBTAIN PATCHES
     --------------
     Obtain the host file BPS_1_19_PSO_IB.KID, which contains the
     following patches:
  
         BPS*1.0*19
         PSO*7.0*427
         IB*2.0*534
  
     Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.
     The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
                     download.vista.domain.ext
  
     This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
     Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
     server as follows:
  
        Albany                  ftp.domain.ext
        Hines                   ftp.domain.ext
        Salt Lake City          ftp.domain.ext
  
     The BPS_1_19_PSO_IB.KID host file is located in the 
     directory. Use ASCII Mode when downloading the file.

         message of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not
         backup any other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, data dictionaries, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
