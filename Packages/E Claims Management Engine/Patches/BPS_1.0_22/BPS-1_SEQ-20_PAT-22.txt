Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements that extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the
 applications involved in this project along with their patch numbers:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                       PSO*7*478
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0     BPS*1*22
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0   PSX*2*81
  
 All three of these patches are being released via Kernel Installation
 and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build distribution.
  
 KIDS multi-build name: BPS PSO PSX BUNDLE 10.0
   KIDS Host File name: BPS_1_22_PSO_PSX.KID
  
  
 This patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
  1. The VER (View ePharmacy Rx) option will have the new action PR (Print
     Reports) added.  This new action will allow the user to enter one or
     more sections to be printed.
  
  2. The CV (Change View) action on the ECME User Screen will be updated
     to allow a user to revert back to the user's saved/preferred view and
     exit the CV action.
  
  3. The ECME AUTO-REVERSAL PROCESS email bulletin will be updated to
     include the patient's eligibility and the drug name.
  
  4. The system will be updated to support new data elements and fields
     for NCPDP Telecommunications versions published through October 2016.
     The testing tool will also be updated to handle the new incoming
     fields.
     a. The BPS NCPDP FIELD DEFS (#9002313.91) file is being updated with
        new NCPDP field information.
     b. The BPS CLAIMS TRANSACTIONS sub-file (#9002313.0201) is being
        updated with a new NCPDP claim request field.
     c. The BPS RESPONSES REPONSES sub-file (#9002313.0301) is being
        updated with a new NCPDP claim response field.
     d. The BPS PAYER RESPONSES OVERRIDES (#9002313.32) file is being
        updated with a new NCPDP claim response field.
  
  5. The Claim Log and the Claim Response Inquiry will be updated to
     include the Facility ID Qualifier and the Reconciliation ID which were
     added as part of the new data elements and fields for NCPDP
     Telecommunications versions published through October 2016.
  
  6. Option PHAR (Edit ECME Pharmacy Data) will be updated to require entry
     for the prompt AUTO-REVERSAL PARAMETER.  The range of allowable values
     for this prompt will be updated to be 3-10.  As part of this update, a
     post install routine will run to update any pharmacies having a nil
     value or a value outside of the 3-10 range to be 5.
  
  7. The OPECC Reject Information Screen will be updated to display the
     Tax ID.
  
  8. This patch rectifies an ongoing problem in which some TRICARE and
     CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of
     Veterans Affairs) prescriptions on the CMOP queue would be left on
     the queue during CMOP processing because claim responses would not be
     received by VistA in a timely manner.  This release modifies the claim
     submission process (BPS*1.0*22, PSO*7.0*478) and the CMOP process
     (PSX*2.0*81) so that certain checks will no longer be performed
     prematurely, allowing sufficient time for the claim responses to come
     back.

 Patch Installation
 ==================
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named 
 POST^BPS22PST.  The purpose of the post-install routine is to:
  
   a. Update the AUTO-REVERSE PARAMETER field in the file BPS PHARMACIES.
      If the value is nil or outside the new range of 3-10, then the value
      is reset to 5.
   b. If the value of the AUTO-REVERSE PARAMETER was changed for any of
      the pharmacies, then an email is sent to users holding the key PSO
      EPHARMACY SITE MANAGER listing the pharmacies whose values were
      modified.
