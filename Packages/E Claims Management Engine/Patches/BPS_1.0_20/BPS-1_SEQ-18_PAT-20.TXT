 KIDS multi-build name: BPS PSO IB PSX PSS BUNDLE 9.0
   KIDS Host File name: BPS_1_20_PSO_IB_PSX_PSS.KID
  
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  1. The CMT Add/View Comments list manager screen, within the ECME User
     screen [BPS USER SCREEN], will contain an additional action of P Add
     Pharmacy/OPECC Comment which triggers the system to prompt for a line 
     number item and the comment.  The date, time, and user will be recorded
     for each entry.  Pharmacy comments entered will be displayed on the
     Outpatient Pharmacy Reject Information screen and the ECME User screen
     [BPS USER SCREEN].
  
  2. The system will allow the user to use an action that resubmits a claim
     from the ECME User screen [BPS USER SCREEN] for a non-billable TRICARE
     or CHAMPVA prescription with a pseudo-rejection of eT or eC.
  
  3. The ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] will display an indicator of RS 
     when a claim is manually resubmitted from the ECME User Screen [BPS USER
     SCREEN]. The resubmission indicator will only be captured and displayed
     for the last transaction and an indicator may be overwritten. The Change
     View action will allow users to select Resubmission and display the ECME
     User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] data based on the user selection.
  
  4. The ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] will contain a new hidden action
     with a new list manager screen called OPECC Reject Information containing
     the following actions:
  
         VW    View Rx
         MP    Medication Profile
         VER   View ePharmacy Rx
         PI    Patient Information
  
  5. The ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] will contain a new hidden action
     called RER Resubmit Claim w/o Reversal which resubmits a claim without
     doing a reversal first, regardless of the previous VistA claim status.
  
  6. The ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] actions will be updated as follows:
  
     CV  Change View           REV Reverse Payable Claim FR  Further Research
     SO  Sort List             RES Resubmit Claim        VER View ePharmacy RX
     CMT Add/View Comments     CLO Close Claim           WRK Send to Worklist
  
  7. The UD Display Update, LOG Print Claim Log, and EX Exit actions will
     become hidden actions on the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN]. 
  
  8. The ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] will display non-billable TRICARE
     entries with a pseudo-rejection code of eT or non-billable CHAMPVA entries
     with a pseudo-rejection code of eC.  An open/closed indicator will display
     on the ECME screen for each non-billable entry and the entry will default
     to an Open entry.
  
  9. The ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] will contain a new hidden action of
     Open/Close Non-Billable Entry which will mark the entry as Open or Closed
     for the purposes of displaying or not displaying the entry on the ECME
     User screen and capture the following:  user name, date, time, comment.
  
 10. The ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] Change View action will offer a
     choice of displaying open non-billable entries, closed non-billable
     entries or all and display the ECME User Screen data based on the user
     selection.
  
 11. The ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] will make these actions unavailable
     for non-billable entries:
  
        REV     Reverse Payable Claim
        CLO     Close Claim
        LOG     Print Claim Log
        WRK     Send to Worklist
        ROC     Reopen Closed Claims
        RED     Resubmit Claim w/EDITS
        RH      Release Copay (On FR  Further Research)
        RER     Resubmit Claim w/o Reversal
  
 12. The Closed Claims Report [BPS RPT CLOSED CLAIMS] will display the billed
     amount in the Excel download format.  When the report is not run to
     capture report data for an Excel document, the Amount Billed will not be
     included in the report.
  
 13. The Potential TRICARE Claims Report [BPS COB RPT TRICARE CLAIMS] will be
     renamed to Potential Claims Report for Dual Eligible [BPS POTENTIAL CLAIMS
     RPT DUAL].  It will prompt the user for patient eligibility, sort the
     report appropriately, and display patient eligibility in the heading of
     the report.
  
 14. The VistA ECME system will use indicator "RS" to indicate that a claim was
     resubmitted via the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN].  To accomplish
     this, the bill type filter will be changed and RS as an indicator will be
     displayed on certain reports where applicable.
  
 15. The Other Reports Menu [BPS MENU RPT OTHER] will contain a new report
     called OPECC Productivity Report [BPS OPECC PRODUCTIVITY REPORT].  The
     report will display information for the claim, by transaction date, with
     the option for a summary, detail or Excel format.
  
 16. A new SECURITY KEY called BPS SUPERVISOR is implemented with this patch.
     This key is required for anyone accessing the OPECC Productivity Report
     [BPS OPECC PRODUCTIVITY REPORT].
  
 17. The system will support new and modified data elements and fields for
     NCPDP Telecommunications version E7 according to the October 2015 
     NCPDP release. Support for new and modified reject codes through this 
     release is also included.
  
 18. The system will no longer contain non-beneficial code for NCPDP version
     5.1.  Some of the version 5.1 code will remain as a roadmap to use the
     next time NCPDP implements major versions.
  
 19. HL7 transmissions for ePharmacy plans, processors, and PBMs (PHARMACY
     BENEFITS MANAGER) from FSC will be re-directed to use the ePharmacy HL7
     link on EPHARM OUT instead of IIV EC.
  
 20. The Vitria Interface Version will be updated to version 5 and a new
     registration message will be sent to AITC to communicate that updates have
     occurred.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There is a pre-install routine associated with this patch named EN^BPS20PRE. 
 The purpose of the pre install routine is to:
  
  a. Update the NCPDP reject codes/descriptions in BPS NCPDP REJECT CODES
     (#9002313.93).
  
 The pre-install routine is automatically deleted by the system if allowed by
 your Kernel site parameters configuration. You may delete routine BPS20PRE if
 the installation was successful and it is not automatically deleted by KIDS.
  
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named 
 POST^BPS20PST. The purpose of the post-install routine is to:
  
  a. Remove the cached hidden parent menu protocol for the ECME User Screen. 
  b. Refine and update the list of visible actions on the ECME User Screen.
  c. Update the Vitria Interface version from 4 to 5.
  d. Perform ePharmacy registration with AITC.
  e. Rename an ECME report option and menu mnemonic.
  f. Modify the ePharmacy HL7 links by adding the DNS server name and 
     removing the IP address.
  
 The post-install routine is automatically deleted by the system if allowed by
 your Kernel site parameters configuration. You may delete routine BPS20PST if
 the installation was successful and it is not automatically deleted by KIDS.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
  
 ***** IMPORTANT NOTE *****
  
 The ePharmacy Logical Links must be stopped before patch installation.  This 
 can be done with the option "Start/Stop Links" [HL START].  The ePharmacy 
 Logical Links which need to be stopped are the following:

 **************************
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed during non-peak hours
 when there is minimal activity on the system. Avoid times when ECME claims are
 being transmitted. Of particular concern are the options below.
  
     1. BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB]
        Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated by the
        BPS Nightly Background Job option. Wait for this job to finish or
        Complete the installation before this job starts.
  
     2. Scheduled CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED CS TRANS] and
        Scheduled Non-CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED NON-CS TRANS]
        Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being transmitted to
        CMOP. Wait for the CMOP transmissions to finish or complete the
        installation before the transmissions start. Both the CS (Controlled
        Substances) and the non-CS CMOP transmission options should be checked.
        Check with Pharmacy Service or your Pharmacy ADPAC to find out when
        CMOP transmissions occur.
  
 This multi-build installation may take between 1 to 10 minutes to install 
 depending on the amount of data in the files being converted.
  
 This multi-build installation can be queued but should not be queued at a 
 time when the BPS NIGHTY BACKGROUND JOB or CMOP transmission processes
 are scheduled.
