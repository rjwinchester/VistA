 This patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
   1. The action OCN Open/Close Non-Billable Entry action will now allow
      the user to select multiple claims.
  
   2. Several enhancements are being made to these ECME reports:  Payable
      Claims; Reversal Claims; Claims Submitted, Not Yet Released; Closed
      Claims; and Non-Billable Status. The enhancements include:
        - Three new filter questions are being added
        - Several of the existing filter questions are being modified to
          allow the selection of one, many, or all
        - The report headings are being modified to accommodate the new
          fields
        - Several header fields are being modified to display ALL or
          SELECTED
        - The Excel report is being modified to add new fields, truncate
          some fields, delete some fields
        - The Excel capture instructions are being reworded
  
   3. The filter questions for the ECME reports listed in #2, above, are
      being modified to allow the user to delete a previously selected
      entry for the multi-selection prompts.
  
   4. The activity log section of View Prescription and the ECME Log Label
      are being modified to replace "BILLING QUANTITY SUBMITTED" with
      "QUANTITY SUBMITTED ON CLAIM".  The LOG Action (Claim Log) on the
      ECME User Screen is being modified to replace "NCPDP Qty" with
      "Quantity Submitted on Claim" and to replace "Billed Qty" with "Rx
      Qty".
  
   5. The system will be updated to support new and modified data
      elements from the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs
      (NCPDP) Implementation Guide versions published through October 2017.
  
   6. Third Party Joint Inquiry (TPJI), the Reject Information
      screen, and the ECME User Screen claim log will be modified to
      display additional field(s).
