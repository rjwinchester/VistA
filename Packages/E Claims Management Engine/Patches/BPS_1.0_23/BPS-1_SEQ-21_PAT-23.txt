Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements that extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the
 applications involved in this project along with their patch numbers:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                       PSO*7*482
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0     BPS*1*23
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                        IB*2*591
  
 All three of these patches are being released via Kernel Installation
 and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build distribution.
  
 KIDS multi-build name: BPS IB PSO BUNDLE 11.0
   KIDS Host File name: BPS_1_23_IB_PSO.KID
  
  
 This patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
   1. Several filters on the Change View (CV) action of ECME User Screen
      are being updated to allow the user to select one, many, or all.
      The user will also now be able to select a specific date range.
  
   2. The Rejected Claims Report is being modified to include three new
      filter questions, and several of the existing filter questions are
      being modified to allow selection of one, many, or all.  The excel
      report is being modified to add new fields, truncate some fields,
      and delete other fields to prevent wrapping to another line.  The
      Prescriber filter question is being modified to default to "A".
  
   3. The system is being updated to support new and modified External
      Code Lists (ECLs) for the NCPDP Telecommunications versions
      published through October 2017.
  
   4. The ePharmacy Medication Profile is being added as an action to
      VER View ePharmacy Rx.
  
   5. The system is being updated to allow for the new HIPAA regulatory
      requirements that increase the length of the following fields: Name
      of Insured, Group Number, Group Name and Subscriber ID. 
  
   6. When the system builds an outgoing claim request, it includes on the
      claim only those fields appearing on the payer sheet provided by the
      payer.  With this enhancement, the user will now be able to send 
      additional fields not on the payer sheet via the RED Action from the
      ECME User Screen.
  
   7. This enhancement adds logic to transmit the appropriate values on
      secondary claims when the three fields are included on the payer
      sheet.  Logic added to fields: Other Payer Patient Responsibility
      Amount, Amount Qualifier, and Amount Count.
