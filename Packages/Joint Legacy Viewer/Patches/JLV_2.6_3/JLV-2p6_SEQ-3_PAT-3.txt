   via C32 and Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) Health 
   Summary in order to have a single view with both VA and DoD records
 - System traceability detailing the logging of system execution steps,
   processing durations, and other critical information to assist with 
   identifying and troubleshooting issues both internal and external to 
   JLV
 - jMeadows performance improvements
 - A refactored Report Builder separating the service from the client 
   application  in order to improve reliability and stability for end 
   users
  
 Participating Test Sites:
  
 The requirements planned for the JLV 2.6.2 Sprints 1-6 were verified and 
 validated during the Development Independent Testing (DIT) phase of 
 testing. All requirements mapped to the test scripts. The scripts are 
 designed to be end-to-end functional tests of the system to evaluate all 
 the technical requirements including the testing of external interfaces 
 where appropriate.
  
 The DIT cycle consisted of smoke testing and the formal DIT. Before 
 starting the DIT cycle, a JLV Web application baseline is installed on the
 system. Tests are than run against this software baseline. Any issues
 found and potential resolutions are assessed for possible inclusion in the
 software baseline.
  
 During DIT, the test team validated the requirements provided in the RTM
 using the test scripts and the test cases. Any issues encountered is
 recorded as a defect in RATIONAL CM.
