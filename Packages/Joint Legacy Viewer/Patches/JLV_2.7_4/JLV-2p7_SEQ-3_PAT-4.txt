 Participating Test Sites:
  
 The requirements planned for the JLV 2.7.2.0.3 Sprints 1-3 were verified
 and validated during the Development Independent Testing (DIT) phase of
 testing. All requirements mapped to the test scripts. The scripts are 
 designed to be end-to-end functional tests of the system to evaluate all 
 the technical requirements including the testing of external interfaces 
 where appropriate.
  
 The DIT cycle consisted of smoke testing and the formal DIT. Before 
 starting the DIT cycle, a JLV Web application baseline is installed on the
 system. Tests are then run against this software baseline. Any issues
 found and potential resolutions are assessed for possible inclusion in the
 software baseline.
  
 During DIT, the test team validated the requirements provided in the
 RATIONAL RM requirements collection using the test scripts and the test 
 cases. Any issue encountered is recorded as a defect in RATIONAL CM.
