 JLV version 2.7.1.0 included the following changes and enhancements:
  
 - JLV will provide a list of clinical reminders of all statuses from all
   registered sites for a given patient
 - Change the site drop-down menu item used by users with CAPRI access
   from "Veterans Benefits Admin" to "CAPRI-Claims"
 - JLV will provide a complete blood bank report for every site where a 
   patient is registered for all dates. This will include all VA blood 
   type testing and transfusions for the selected patient.
 - Start Date and Stop Date columns will be displayed in the expanded
   view of the orders widget.
 - The "Gender" field has been renamed to "Birth Sex" in the VA Patient
   Demographics area.
 - The outpatient medications widget displays the prescription number in 
   a new column adjacent to the drug name in the expanded view.
 - JLV will present a dialog warning a user when adding a duplicate 
   widget to the current tab.
 - JLV will include Primary Care Team details and contact information in
   the Demographics widget.
 - JLV will query eHealth Exchange using a date range spanning the past 
   150 years through 1 year in the future.
 - JLV will sort data with partial dates in the same manner that VistA 
   does:
   - A date with month and year but no day will be treated like the day 
     is 0.
   - A date that is only a year will be treated like the month is 
     January and the day is 00.
 - A new Surgery / Procedure Reports - VA ONLY widget that displays 
   surgical and operative reports from VA sources for all dates will be 
   added to JLV.
  
 Participating Test Sites:
  
 The requirements planned for the JLV 2.7.1 Sprints 1-3 were verified and 
 validated during the Development Independent Testing (DIT) phase of 
 testing. All requirements mapped to the test scripts. The scripts are 
 designed to be end-to-end functional tests of the system to evaluate all 
 the technical requirements including the testing of external interfaces 
 where appropriate.
  
 The DIT cycle consisted of smoke testing and the formal DIT. Before 
 starting the DIT cycle, a JLV Web application baseline is installed on the
 system. Tests are then run against this software baseline. Any issues
 found and potential resolutions are assessed for possible inclusion in the
 software baseline.
  
 During DIT, the test team validated the requirements provided in the
 RATIONAL RM requirements collection using the test scripts and the test 
 cases. Any issue encountered is recorded as a defect in RATIONAL CM.
