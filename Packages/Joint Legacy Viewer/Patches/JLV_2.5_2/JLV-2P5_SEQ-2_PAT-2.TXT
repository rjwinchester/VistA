 Participating Test Sites:
 =========================
 The requirements planned for the JLV 2.5.2.0.1 (listed in Section 1.3, 
 Testing Scope) Sprints 1-4 were verified and validated during the
 Development Independent Testing (DIT) phase of testing. All requirements
 mapped to the test scripts. The scripts are designed to be end-to-end
 functional tests of the system to evaluate all the technical requirements
 including the testing of external interfaces where appropriate.
  
 The DIT cycle consisted of smoke testing and the formal DIT. Before 
 starting the DIT cycle, a JLV Web application baseline is installed on the
 system. Tests are than run against this software baseline. Any issues
 found and potential resolutions are assessed for possible inclusion in the
 software baseline.
  
 During DIT, the test team validated the requirements provided in the RTM
 using the test scripts and the test cases. Any issues encountered is
 recorded as a defect in JIRA (internal defect tracking repository used).
  
  
 Documentation Instructions:
 ==========================
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may also
 elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly 
 using Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
 directory at the following OI Field Offices:
    
 Albany:                 domain.ext
 Hines:                  domain.ext
