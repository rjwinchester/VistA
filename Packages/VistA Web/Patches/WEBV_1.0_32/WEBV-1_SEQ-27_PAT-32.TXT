 *************************************************************************
  
 VistAWeb (VW) v16.1.6 includes a fix for the following issues:
  
 1.  The 'COPY TO CLIPBOARD' button in the Allergies section of VistAWeb is
     not copying data correctly.
  
 2.  The VistAWeb user guide is currently out of date and needs to be
     updated to reflect current functionality in the VistAWeb application. 
  
 3.  All occurrences of the acronym 'NwHIN' and 'NHIN' need to be replaced
     with the term ' Non-VA' or appropriate wording as defined by the
     Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) Health team.
  
 4.  When a patient has multiple names (legal name followed by alias')
     listed in their C32 file, the names are being displayed inaccurately
     in VistAWeb.
  
 5.  The 'Problem' section of the C32 file is not displaying data properly
     for most partners.
  
 6.  The VistAWeb user guide needs to be updated to include verbiage that
     informs the users of the hover-over capabilities within the VistAWeb
     application.
  
 7.  Emergency Contact information is missing/incorrect on C32 file.
  
 8.  VistAWeb style sheets do not display any information in three fields
     for the 'Immunization Reaction' section of the C32 file.
  
 9.  Multiple fields in the Vitals section of a C32 file display nothing in
     fields where there is no data. Normally when a field is null, the
     field will contain ' -- ' (double hyphens).
  
 10. VistAWeb style sheets are displaying the dispense date where the
     medication expiration date should be.
  
 11. The Lab Results section of the MedVA C32 does not display the
     Result-Unit field for a result that has the type 'IVL_PQ'.
  
 12. In the Lab Results section of a C32, the Result-Unit field displays in
     a way which can be misleading and difficult to read.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1.  INC000000771376 - Clipboard button not copying correct text
  
     Problem:
     ======== 
     The 'COPY TO CLIPBOARD' button in the Allergies section of the
     VistAWeb application is currently not copying the correct data. 
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     Updated the DetailPage.aspx file to allow the 'COPY TO CLIPBOARD'
     button to copy the correct data.
  
  
 2.  INC000000951932 - User Guide needs to be Updated
  
     Problem:
     ======== 
     The VistAWeb user guide is currently out of date and needs to be
     updated to reflect current functionality in the VistAWeb application.   
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     Updated text and screen shots in the VistAWeb user guide to keep it
     in sync with VistAWeb's current functionality. 
  
  
 3.  INC000000968186 - Replace terms NwHIN or NHIN terms with Non-VA
  
     Problem:
     ======== 
     All occurrences of the acronyms 'NwHIN' and 'NHIN' need to be replaced
     with the term 'Non-VA' or appropriate wording as defined by the VLER
     Health team.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     Updated the VistAWeb application to use the term 'Non-VA' or
     appropriate wording instead of the NwHIN/NHIN acronyms.
  
  
 4.  INC000000975798 - Do not concatenate patient name and patient alias
                       name
  
     Problem:
     ======== 
     When a patient has multiple names (legal name followed by alias)
     listed in their C32 file, the names are being displayed inaccurately
     in VistAWeb. VistAWeb is currently not able to handle multiple names
     correctly. 
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     Modified the 'cda2detail.xsl' file to process multiple patient
     names/aliases correctly. If multiple names are present, any additional
     names will be displayed prefaced with 'Alias:'. 
  
  
 5.  INC000001012220 - Update display order of Problem Code field
  
     Problem:
     ======== 
     The 'Problem' section of the C32 file is not displaying data properly
     for most partners.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     Modified 'nhinCommon.xsl' to pull data from the correct location for the
     'Problem' section.
  
  
 6.  INC000001017112 - Notify User to Hover Over Fields to see complete
                       contents
  
     Problem:
     ========
     The VistAWeb user guide needs to be updated to include verbiage that
     informs the users of the hover-over capabilities within the VistAWeb
     application.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     Updated the VistAWeb user guide to include verbiage regarding the
     hover-over capabilities within the application.
  
  
 7.  INC000001038959 - Emergency Contact Information Missing/Incorrect
  
     Problem:
     ======== 
     Emergency contact information being passed through to VistAWeb is
     not displayed with the correct information for that contact. A C32
     with multiple emergency contacts is displayed as one contact with
     the information of all entries added to the one contact displayed.
     This made it impossible to distinguish which contact's information
     went with which contact.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     Modified the cda2detail.xsl file to now recognize and display multiple
     contacts correctly.
  
  
 8.  INC000001008906 - VW is not displaying Immunization Series,
                       Reaction, Comments.
  
     Problem:
     ======== 
     VistAWeb style sheets do not display any information in three fields
     for the 'Immunization Reaction' section of the C32. The series,
     reaction, and comments sections are not being displayed even when the
     C32 contains that data.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     The templates that were designed to retrieve this information had
     invalid XPaths and did not reference where the data actually was. The
     templates for those three fields have been modified to now display
     such information.
  
  
 9. INC000000995050 - Vital Signs Table Displaying Double Dashes
                       Inconsistently
  
     Problem:
     ======== 
     Multiple fields in the Vitals section of a C32 display nothing in
     fields where there is no data. Normally when a field is null, that
     field will contain ' -- ' (double hyphens) displayed with a flyover
     display of 'Not Available'. The lack of double hyphens may lead users
     to think data may be present but not displayed.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     In the vitals section the fields had a condition that would display
     ' -- ', although this condition was dependent on a value existing in
     each field. The sections have been rearranged so they will display
     ' -- ' when the field is empty or null.
  
  
 10. INC000001028894 - Wrong path used for Medication Expiration Date
  
     Problem:
     ======== 
     VistAWeb style sheets are displaying the dispense date where the
     medication expiration date should be.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     The Medication Expiration template has been rearranged so that the
     correct date now appears first before checking in other locations.
  
  
 11. INC000000906586 - Certain MedVA test results are not displaying
  
     Problem:
     ======== 
     The Lab Results section of the MedVA C32 does not display the
     Result-Unit field for a result that has the type 'IVL_PQ'.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     Added a reference to the template that retrieves the Result-Unit
     to now look for the value of 'IVL_PQ'.
  
  
 12. INC000000752965 - Add four empty spaces between lab results value and
                       result units
  
     Problem:
     ======== 
     In the Lab Results section of a C32, the Result-Unit field displays
     in a way which can be misleading and difficult to read. If a
     Result-Unit has both a result and a unit which are numeric the values
     may run together and appear as one value.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     For the Result-Unit field, four spaces were added between the result
     and the unit data types.
