 **************************************************************************
 VistAWeb v16.1.8.2 This release is comprised of enhancements to the 
 VistAWeb application only, but is being delivered by the eHX project 
 because VistAWeb is in sustainment and does not have an active 
 development contract. Also the eHX team has hands on experience with the 
 Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) and the depth of 
 knowledge required to develop a stylesheet to transform raw data to the 
 required human readable format displayed in VistAWeb and JLV..
  
 This enhancement release consists of the following enhancements to the 
 VistAWeb system:
 -Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) Receive and Display 
 Structured Notes feature will modify the software to receive the 
 following C-CDA structured documents from external partners: Progress 
 Note, Continuity of Care, Discharge Summaries, Consultation Note, History 
 and Physicals Note, Operative Note, Procedure Note, and Unstructured 
 Document. The VistaWeb GUI will display the same structured documents by 
 Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC). 
   The View C-CDA in VistaWeb feature will provide the ability to create a 
 fully populated test instance of a C-CDA. Necessary changes will be 
 implemented in the current VA GUI software to allow VA viewing of partner 
 C-CDA. Encounter data will include Inpatient Encounters and Immunization 
 data will be processed in codes for vaccine administered. Transition of 
 care/referral summaries will have the ability to be received and viewed 
 according to the formatting in the American Society for Testing and 
 Materials (ASTM) E2360 Standard Specification for Continuity of Care 
 Record and Standard. The system will electronically receive and 
 incorporate clinical laboratory tests and values/results in accordance 
 with the LOINC.
