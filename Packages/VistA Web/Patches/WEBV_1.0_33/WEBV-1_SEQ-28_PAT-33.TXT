 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
  
 1.  INC000001106094 - Issue related to the display of references
   
     Problem:
     ======== 
     In the Results section of a C32, there are entries that display as 
     "Unknown" for the Result Type. For these entries, no other data is
     shown even though the entry may have data related to it in a reference
     value.
   
     Resolution:
     ===========
     The code in stylesheet NhinCommon.xsl has been modified so that the 
     Result-Unit field will search for data by a reference value after it 
     searches all previous data sources. 
   
 2.  INC000001122467 - Issues with display of Encounter Discharge 
                       Summaries
   
     Problem:
     ======== 
     C32s sent from the partner Epic Health do not display the "Encounter 
     Type" and "Encounter Comments" fields in the Encounter section.
   
     Resolution:
     ===========
     Changes have been made to the stylesheet NhinCommon.xsl to look in 
     additional locations when looking for the data for the "Encounter
     Type" and "Encounter Comments" fields.
  
 3.  INC000001081333 - VistAWeb is displaying an empty table
   
     Problem:
     ======== 
     When a provider sends a C32 document and that C32 contains a title 
     for a section that has no data that section's title is displayed
     along with a column header for a table that is empty.
   
     Resolution:
     ===========
     The code in cda2detail.xsl has been modified so that the stylesheet 
     checks to see if the section it is about to build a table for has
     data before building the column header for that section. Additionally,
     the message that displays when there is no data has been changed to
     make more sense to the user.
     
 4.  INC000001250142 - Hyperlink no longer exists. 
  
     Problem:
     ======== 
     The left hand menu when you have a patient selected in VistAWeb shows 
     the user the double dagger character and a hyperlink to show a
     definition of Non-VA health data. This link no longer exists and 
     should be removed, but the reminder that a double dagger is for Non-VA
     data should remain.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     Hyperlink has been removed but the text still remains.
