Subject: DD CHANGE FOR TYPE OF VISIT FILE

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 A request was made to update the SHORT NAME (#.015) field in the  
 TYPE OF VISIT (#357.69) file. This field is computed using a pointer to 
 the SHORT NAME (#2) field in the CPT (#81) file; a field that is being 
 removed by patch ICPT*6.0*46. This patch will redefine the computed 
 expression used in the SHORT NAME (#.015) field to use an API to populate
 the SHORT NAME data.

  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000001105414 - CPT direct global read in DD - AICS (IBD)
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 The SHORT NAME (#2) field in the CPT (#81) file is being deleted by patch
 ICPT*6.0*46. The TYPE OF VISIT (#357.69) file's SHORT NAME (#.015) field
 contains a computed expression that will no longer generate the correct
 information once ICPT*6.0*46 is installed. 
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch will change the value of the SHORT NAME (#.015) computed expression
 to use the CPT^ICPTCOD API which will populate the correct SHORT NAME data.
