Description:
============

 Shortly after the release of several ICD-10 patches (LEX*2*80, ICD*18*57,
 IBD*3*63, etc.), several sites reported that the encounter form dialog in
 CPRS was taking an average of 1-2 mins to load. This was unacceptable and
 impacting patient care. 
  
 It is important to note that certain encounter forms will take a little
 longer to load than others due to the varying data intensity levels of the
 forms. This is particularly true for the National Primary Care FY14-Q4
 form, which consists of some 1331 diagnoses and over 120 procedures.
  
 The six sites who reported the issue include: Asheville, Beckley, Salem, 
 Northern Indiana, Dallas, & Omaha. After some investigation, it was 
 determined that half of these sites were still running on VMS servers and 
 the other half a mixed OS environment (VMS back end with Linux front 
 end). Some metric tests were performed and it was determined that running
 on a slower VMS system did contribute to some of the performance issues, 
 but not entirely all.
  
 After further research, it was concluded that several API's that are 
 called to retrieve encounter form information during the load could be
 optimized for improvement. One of the API's is DIAG^ORWPCE which is 
 modified in the OR*3.0*398 patch. The associating API, CHKLST^IBDF18A2 is
 updated in this patch. These two patches comprise the short term solution
 and serve to provide an immediate remedy while a long term solution is
 being developed.
  
  
 This patch addresses the issue noted in Remedy Ticket: INC000001042172

  INC000001042172
   
    Problem:   
    --------
    After the installation of Lex 80 and ICD 57 we have 
    experienced a 30 to 45 second delay before the encounter box pops up.
  
  INC000001054218:
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Users have been experiencing significant delays in accessing
    encounter forms in CPRS since installing patch PXRM*2*26. Takes
    anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes for the form to open once 
    clicking on it.
  
  INC000001050760:
  
    Problem:
    --------
    CPRS encounter form dialog performance issues.
  
  
    Resolution: (applies to all 3 tickets)
    -----------
    This patch will update this process to utilize a faster more
    streamlined API to return the status of each diagnosis in the
    diagnosis list for a clinic.
  
    Technical: (applies to all 3 tickets)
    ----------
    The IBDF18A2 routine currently utilizes the STATCHK^IBDUTICD API
    which calls ICDDATA^ICDXCODE which returns a considerable amount of
    data in addition to the status, which is what is really needed.
  
    IBDF18A2 was updated to utilize the STATCHK^ICDEX API which returns the
    status and just two other fields. This significantly speeds up the
    response time for the user.

  Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
  -------------------------------------
   
  Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by 
  this patch is available.
   
  The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
  ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/. This transmits the files from the first
