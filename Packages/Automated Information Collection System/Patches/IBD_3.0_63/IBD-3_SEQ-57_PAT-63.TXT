Description:
============

 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the implementation date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
 systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
 which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research.
  
 The patch IBD*3.0*63 makes the following changes to the Automated 
 Information Collection System (AICS) package:
 1. Addition of the new "Encounter Forms ICD-10 Update" report.
 - A new menu item--Encounter Forms > Reports and Utilities > Encounter 
 Forms ICD-10 Update--was introduced to run this report. This new report 
 allows the user to display a list of Encounter Forms and Clinics after
 making selections from several input options. When the report has been
 displayed, the user may then update the ICD-10 Status field. Two new
 routines were written for this new report: IBDFUTL4 and IBDFUTL5.
 - Two date fields show the latest dates that the form was changed. The
 history fields contain the user ID (DUZ) of the person who last changed 
 the files. 
 2. Modification of some AICS routines to replace direct global reads and
 old Application Program Interfaces (APIs) with new Lexicon and Global
 Coding system APIs wherever possible. Several AICS routines were modified
 to replace direct global reads to the ICD Diagnosis file (#80). For
 example, a direct read to ^ICD9(IEN#,0) to find the ICD code or
 description was replaced by a call to this API:
 ICDDATA^ICDXCODE. These routines were changed to accommodate this: 
 IBDFBK2, IBDFN4, IBDFN7, IBDFN8, IBDFN9, IBDFN11, IBDFN14, IBDFLST, 
 IBDFUTL and IBDFUTL1.
 3.Modifications of the software to use hardcoded ICD-10 code "R69." for 
 ICD-10 coding whenever the ICD-9 logic is using hardcoded ICD-9 code 
 "799.9". 
 4. Addition of ICD-10 Code selections in Encounter Forms and Maintenance 
 Utility Active/Inactive Report.
 5. Addition of Input Type ICD-10 Code Interface Package.
 6. Addition of Selection Type ICD-10 Code Interface Package.
 7. Addition of ICD-10 Code Tool Kit Block.
 8. Addition of ICD-10 Code text verbiage.
 9. Addition of ICD-10 Code wildcard search help text.
 10. Changes have been made to ICR# 1296 to introduce new parameters values
 for the API GETLST^IBDF18A.
 11. The Replace Code option in the Maintenance Utility Report uses the 
 approved standard Lexicon partial code search.
 12. Help text has been further refined to define a partial code wild card 
 search. 
 13. The Problem List Package Interfaces are obsolete. Because of this, 
 the Problem List Package Interfaces have been made Unavailable. This will
 relieve all dependencies on Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
 v29.
 14. If the user editing Encounter Forms has Lexicon User Filters in place 
 those filters will be honored with the exception of editing an ICD-9 
 block or editing an ICD-10 block within the encounter form.  When editing 
 ICD-9 blocks the user will be allowed to choose from any ICD-9 code and 
 when editing an ICD-10 block the user will be allowed to select any 
 ICD-10 code, regardless of what Lexicon User Filters are in place.

   When a user terminates out of the Replace Code prompts with an '^' or a 
   time out, the ICD-9 or ICD-10 code is replaced. 
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The Replace Code option in the Maintenance Utility Report has been

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The post install process performs the following updates and additions:
  a) Inactivating obsolete Problem List Package Interfaces
  b) Adding an "ICD-10 DIAGNOSIS CODE" record to #359.1 file
  c) Adding a "SHORT NARRATIVE (60 CHAR)" record to #359.1 file"
  d) Adding "INPUT DIAGNOSIS CODE (ICD10)" record to #357.6 file"
  e) Adding "DG SELECT ICD-10 DIAGNOSIS CODES" record to #357.6 file"
  f) Adding ICD-10 blocks to both the TOOL KIT form and the DEFAULTS form.
   The IBD*3.0*63 patch adds new ICD-10 related entries to various AICS 
   files during its installation. It also updates some existing entries in 
   AICS files. One of the entries that is updated by the installation 
   process is the DEFAULTS form in File #357, which contains all standard 
   blocks. During installation the new ICD-10 block is added to the
   DEFAULTS form. This standard form is supposed to reside in all AICS
   databases and should not be deleted. In case it was deleted for some
   reason, the IBD*3.0*63 installation process checks if the DEFAULTS form
   exists in the AICS environment. If it is not found, then a warning
   message is printed on the screen and to the installation log, and the
   following e-mail is sent to the person who is installing the patch or
   to the POSTMASTER user:
       The DEFAULTS form was not found in the environment and therefore
     the installation process didn't add the new ICD-10 block to the
     DEFAULTS form.
       Please log a Remedy ticket to add the DEFAULTS form to your AICS
     environment if you need it.
       When you have it in the environment you can use TK menu options
     to add the ICD-10 block to the DEFAULTS form manually.
  g) Changing block names from "DIAGNOSIS (V2.1)" to "ICD-9 DIAGNOSIS 
 (V2.1)"
  h) Changing text In the INPUT DIAGNOSIS CODE (ICD9) record from 
 "Diagnosis Code" to "ICD-9 Diagnosis code"
  i) Setting the Coding System flag in #357, field #.22 for ICD-9 and 
 ICD-10 Package Interfaces.
  
 Note: The database changes b) through i) listed above can be done only 
 once. If the patch is installed the 2nd time then this portion of the 
 post-install process will be skipped.
