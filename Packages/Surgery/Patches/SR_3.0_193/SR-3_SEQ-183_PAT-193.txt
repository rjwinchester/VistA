 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 INC0448967 - Preoperative CVD data fields assigned invalid values
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user is in the process of entering preoperative info using the
 "Preoperative Information (Enter/Edit") [SROA PREOP DATA] option
 and enters an "NS" (no study) in the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (#210)
 grouping, which is a component of the SURGERY file (#130), the 
 CVD fields, CVD REPAIR/OBSTRUCTION (#521) and HISTORY OF CVD (#522), 
 are being assigned the "NS" value. Per definition of these fields
 in the data dictionary, this is an invalid value.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine ^SROAPRE2 is modified to assign the value of zero (0)
 to both the CVD REPAIR/OBSTRUCTION (#521) and HISTORY OF CVD (#522),
 fields of the SURGERY file (#130) when the user enters "NS" 
 (no study) at the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (#210) grouping level.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch 
    can be installed when Surgery users are on the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
          problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
       Following options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       To preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch prior
       to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' 
       option at this time. You may also compare the routines in your 
       production account to the routines in the patch by using the 
      'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' 
       Menu and select the package 'SR*3.0*193'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       YES//, choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
       And Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Post Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 None.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between
 development team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA
 personnel. It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the
 routine included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.

Routine Information:
====================
