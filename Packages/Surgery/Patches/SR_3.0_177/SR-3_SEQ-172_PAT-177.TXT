Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_Production_Overview_Guide_Groups_3_4.pdf) posted on the
 Anonymous directory for installation order. This is critical for 
 proper functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the ICD-10 Activation Date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000
 ICD-9 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) 
 procedure codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000.  
 Both systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
 which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research.
  
 The only noticeable difference users may see will occur when a specific 
 ICD diagnosis code descriptor changes based on the date of operation for 
 the case.
