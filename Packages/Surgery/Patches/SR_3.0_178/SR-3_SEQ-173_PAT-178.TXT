Subject: FIX MULTIPLE SURGERY ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 This patch will correct the following issues currently occurring in the
 VistA Surgery application:
  
 In the Surgery option Exclusion Criteria (Enter/Edit) [SR NO ASSESSMENT
 REASON] when users try to enter exclusion criteria beginning with
 'EXCEEDS' at the 'Reason an Assessment was not Created:' prompt, the
 response 'EXCEEDS MAX ASSMNTS' is always displaying no matter what the
 user has entered/selected.
  
 Next, the FIELD field (#2) for the ATTENDING CODE entry of the Surgery
 Interface Parameter file (#133.2) points to the ATTENDING CODE field
 (#.165) of the SURGERY file (#130) which is no longer used. It should
 point to ATTENDING CODE field (#.166) of the SURGERY file.
  
 Finally, when printing the 'LONG' form version of an operation request for
 a particular surgical specialty in the Operation Requests for a Day [SROP
 REQ] option in the Surgery Menu, a site noticed the Case Order number is
 not displaying correctly.
