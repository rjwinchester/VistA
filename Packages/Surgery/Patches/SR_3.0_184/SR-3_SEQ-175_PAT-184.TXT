 In support of the VA Surgery Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP), this 
 patch provides update to the Veterans Health Information Systems and
 Technology Architecture (VistA) Surgery package.
 The updates include the addition of new data fields, changes to existing
 fields, changes to data entry screens, changes to reports, changes to the
 Surgery Risk Assessment transmissions, and changes to transplant
 components of the VistA Surgery application.

     options.
  
  c. This patch adds the SPINAL LEVEL field (#136) under the Request 
     Operation options, the Operation Scheduling options, and the Schedule
     of Operations report option. This field will be available for edit
     only if the PLANNED PRIN PROCEDURE CODE field (#27) of the case
     matches one of the entries in the CPT-SPINAL LEVEL file (#131.4) which

     - RESTING ST DEPRESSION (#350)
   
     o The data definition of the "PREOP FUNCT. HEALTH STATUS" field (#492)

 5. Case Aborted
    The Abort/Cancel Operation [SROABRT] option has been added as new 
    option under the Operation Menu [SROPER] menu. This menu option should
    only be used if the patient has been taken to the operating room and no
    incision has been made. If an incision is made, the case should be 
    completed and the discontinued procedure indicated in the record.  
    Cancellation of future surgical cases should not use this option.
    When using this option, the user will be prompted for CASE ABORTED 
    field (#18.5) with "NO" default.
    The cancellation information fields (CANCEL DATE, CANCELLATION
    TIMEFRAME, and PRIMARY CANCEL REASON) have been removed from
    all data entry screen under the operation menu except from the new 
    option.
    When this option is used to abort surgical case, the CANCELLATION
    TIMEFRAME field (#17.5) will be set to "1".
  
    **There are known defects in SR*3*184 with this new option.  These will
    be addressed in a future patch. 
    Defect 1) PRIMARY CANCEL REASON is not properly saved to the Surgery
    package. 
    Defect 2) User is prompted for "Cancellation Avoidable" instead of
    "Cancellation Timeframe".
     
 6. Height and Weight Fields
     The HEIGHT (#236) and the WEIGHT (#237) fields have been added to the 
     first page of the Operation Startup [SROMEN-START] screen and will be
     auto populated using available data from the Vitals Package.
  
 7. This patch updates various fields in the SURGERY file (#130) and 
    various occurrence category descriptions in the PERIOPERATIVE
    OCCURRENCE CATEGORY file (#136.5).
    This patch also replaces various fields with new fields in order to
    enhance and refine certain data elements that are in common with
    cardiac and non-cardiac risk assessments. All the associated data input
    options, assessment printouts and transmissions are updated
    accordingly.
     
    The complete list of updated fields, new fields and replaced fields is
    in the patch release notes.
  
 8. This patch changes the PLANNED PRIN PROCEDURE CODE field (#27) to 
    be a mandated field when creating Surgery cases and limits selection of
    CPT codes to range of (10000-69999; 00100-01999; 70000-79999;
    D0000-D9999;  nnnnT.)
  
    **There is a known defect in SR*3*184 where, in certain instances, 
    active CPT codes D0000-D9999 and xxxxT will not be selectable. A 
    correction for this will be addressed in a future patch.
    
 9. This patch updates the CPT EXCLUSIONS file (#137) with data for 
    fiscal year 2015.
  
 10. The Transplant Assessment Menu [SR TRANSPLANT ASSESSMENT] menu 
     has been placed out of order.
  
 11. This patch removes missing data screening for major/minor field
     (removed by Patch 182) - this impacts  Lists 7 and 8 of the List of
     Surgery Risk Assessments [SROA ASSESSMENT LIST] option.
  
 12. The WOUND CLASSIFICATION field (#1.09) prevents the selection of 
     "CLEAN" if the planned principle procedure code (CPT) matches one of 
     the CPTs that cannot be classified as clean. However, if data has 
     already been populated for this field and the user tries to update it 
     again, then the "CLEAN" option will be displayed.
  
 13. The exclusion criteria list of the Monthly Surgical Case Workload 
     Report [SROA MONTHLY WORKLOAD REPORT] option has been updated as
     follows:
     - The "SCNR WAS ON A/L" criteria has been changed to "10% RULE"
     - The "STUDY CRITERIA" criteria has been changed to "INCLUSION CRTA 
       NOT MET"
     - A new "ABORTED" criteria has been added to the exclusion list
  
 14. Options #4 and #5 of the List of Surgery Risk Assessments [SROA 
     ASSESMENT LIST] option are placed out of order (Deactivated) after
     this enhancement.
