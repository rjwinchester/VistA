Associated patches: (v)SR*3*184    <<= must be installed BEFORE `SR*3*188'

Subject: ABORTED STATUS, UNABLE TO SIGN NIR, UNABLE TO ENTER D CODES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses three (3) issues:
  
 1.   Cases aborted prior to the release of SR*3.0*184 are displayed as 
      "CANCELLED" in the "Operation Menu" option [SROPER].
  
 2.   Nurses are unable to sign their Nurse Intraoperative Report (NIR) 
      in the Surgical Package when the case has been aborted using the 
      "Abort/Cancel Operation" option [SROABRT].
  
 3.   Users are unable to enter a D Code (Dental) in the PLANNED 
      PRIN PROCEDURE CODE field (#27) of the SURGERY file (#130) using
      the "Non-O.R. Procedures" option [SRONOP] in the Surgery package.

 CA SDM Overview:
 ================
  
 1.      I7554940FY16 - Aborted Status
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Cases aborted prior to the release of SR*3.0*184 are displayed as 
 "CANCELLED" in the "Operation Menu" option [SROPER]. This occurs because
 the SROPER option code modified by SR*3.0*184 only checks the newly 
 added CASE ABORTED field (#18.5) in the SURGERY file (#130). Cases 
 entered prior to SR*3.0*184 do not have the CASE ABORTED field and 
 display as cancelled rather than aborted.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine ^SROP1 is modified to check both in the new SR*3.0*184 
 fashion and in the traditional manner.
  
 Routines: SROP1
  
 2.      R7494990FY16 - Unable to Sign NIR
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Nurses are unable to sign their Nurse Intraoperative Report (NIR) in the
 Surgical Package when the case has been aborted using the "Abort/Cancel 
 Operation" option [SROABRT]. The code in the SROABRT option uses a FileMan
 call (^DIE) to update the TIME PAT OUT OR field (#.232) in the SURGERY 
 file (#130). TIME PAT OUT OR has a FIELD INDEX that creates the stub 
 entries in TIU (Text Integration Utility) for the NIR for a case. The 
 update code in the SROABRT option fails the Set Condition when setting 
 the FIELD INDEX. It fails because it updates TIME PAT OUT OR directly 
 prior to performing the FileMan call. When it fails the Set Condition, 
 it doesn't create the TIU stub entries for the case. When the TIU stub
 entries don't exist, the option to electronically sign a NIR are not 
 presented to the nurse/user.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine ^SRSCAN0 is modified to not update the TIME PAT OUT OR field
 prior to the FileMan call.  When the premature update is removed, the 
 SROABRT option functions properly and the option to electronically sign 
 the NIR is presented to the nurse/user.
  
 Routines: SRSCAN0
  
 3.      I7563808FY16 - Unable to Enter D Code
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Users are unable to enter a D Code (Dental) in the PLANNED PRIN 
 PROCEDURE CODE field (#27) of the SURGERY file (#130) using the "Non-O.R. 
 Procedures" option [SRONOP] in the Surgery package.
  
 The same is true when entering a case using the Operation options in 
 the Surgery Package so sites are unable to document D Code procedures 
 in the PLANNED PRIN PROCEDURE CODE field.
  
 The entry fails because the $$CHK^SROCPT extrinsic function, called by
 the INPUT TRANSFORM for the PLANNED PRINCIPLE PRODECURE field, is passed
 the IEN (Internal Entry Number) rather than the external form (display 
 form) of the entered CPT Code. For numeric CPT Codes, this is not an 
 issue as the IEN and the numeric value of the CPT Code are the same. For
 alphanumeric codes (such as D Codes), the extrinsic function code needs
 to convert the passed value to the external format.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The CHK^SROCPT extrinsic function is modified to retrieve the CPT CODE 
 field (#.01) from the CPT file (#81).

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch 
    Can be installed when Surgery users are on the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
          problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
       Following options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       To preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch prior
       to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' 
       option at this time. You may also compare the routines in your 
       production account to the routines in the patch by using the 
      'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' 
       Menu and select the package 'SR*3.0*188'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       YES//, choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
       And Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
