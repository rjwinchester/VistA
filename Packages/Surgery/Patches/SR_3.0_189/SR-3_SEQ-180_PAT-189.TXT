Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch address the following issue:
  
 1. The SURGERY file (#130) ADT and ARS cross references do not merge during a
    patient merge.
  
 Associated Ticket(s):

 1. I8053319FY16 - AEU reports the site had a patient merge but the surgery
                   information did not transfer with the account.

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1. I8053319FY16 - AEU reports the site had a patient merge but the surgery
                   information did not transfer with the account.
  
 Patient Safety Issues:
 ----------------------
 PSPO00003176: The Patient Merge software must have full interoperability
               with all other VistA packages, such as Surgery and
               Radiology.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The SURGERY file (#130) ADT and ARS cross references do not merge during a
 patient merge. These cross references have a non-standard PATIENT (#2) file
 pointer. The merging of a non-standard PATIENT file (#2) pointer during a
 patient merge should have been handled by the file developers but were not.
 Post install routine SR3189P will remove the old cross references.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Data Dictionary for the SURGERY (#130) file was modified to delete the
 old Traditional style "ADT" and "ARS" xrefs and create New style "ADT" and
 "ARS" indexes. The "ADT" index be will updated any time the PATIENT (#.01)
 or DATE OF OPERATION (#.09) fields are modified in the SURGERY (#130)
 file.  The "ARS" index will be updated any time the PATIENT (#.01),
 ASSESSMENT STATUS (#235), or ASSESSMENT TYPE (#284) fields are modified in
 the SURGERY (#130) file.
