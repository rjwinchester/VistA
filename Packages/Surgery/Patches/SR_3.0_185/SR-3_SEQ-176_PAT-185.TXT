Subject: RISK ASSESSMENT TRANSMISSION UNDEF, NON-OR PROCEDURE REPORT DEFECT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses the following issues in the VistA Surgery application:
  
 1. During transmission of Surgery Risk Assessments, an UNDEFINED error
    occurs when routine SROATMNO calls routine ADM1^SROAPIMS without
    initializing the needed local variable SRSOUT.
  
 2. Routines that generate the Report of Non-O.R. Procedures [SRONOR] 
    option need to be modified to recognize recent modifications to the
    IN/OUT-PATIENT field (#.011) in the SURGERY file (#130): three (3)
    values have been added to the SET of allowable choices ("1" FOR SAME
    DAY, "2" FOR ADMISSION, "3" FOR HOSPITALIZED).

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC000001108479 - Risk Assessment Transmission UNDEF
  
    Duplicates:
    -----------
    INC000001113414
    INC000001124120 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Whether started manually from the VistA Surgery Risk Assessment Menu by
    selecting Queue Assessment Transmission [SROA TRANSMIT ASSESSMENT]
    option or via Surgery Nightly Cleanup and Updates [SRTASK-NIGHT] 
    option, the process can encounter an UNDEFINED error. The error occurs
    when routine ^SROATMNO calls routine ADM1^SROAPIMS.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The code at ADM1+4^SROAPIMS is modified to use the $GET function to 
    return a null value if the variable is undefined. The modification 
    prevents the UNDEFINED error.
  
 2. INC000001108876 - Non-OR Procedure Report Defect
     
    Problem:
    --------
    When the Report of Non-O.R. Procedures [SRONOR] option is printed
    selecting the By Location sort, the program prints "???" in the
    column where it should print the HOSPITAL ADMISSION STATUS field
    (#.011) of the SURGERY file (#130). This occurs because of recent
    changes to the data definition of the field. The NAME TITLE was changed
    from IN/OUT-PATIENT STATUS to HOSPITAL ADMISSION STATUS and the SET of
    allowable values was expanded. The programs for the By Specialty and By
    Provider sort were modified to recognize the additional SET values. The
    program for the By Location sort was not similarly modified. As a
    consequence, when the field value to be printed is 1, 2 or 3; the
    program displays "???".
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The program for the By Location is modified in the same manner as the 
    other sorts.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can be
 installed when Surgery users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
   1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
      select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
      that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
   5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
              Print Transport Global
              Compare Transport Global to Current System
              Backup a Transport Global
  
      To preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch prior to
      installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' option
      at this time. You may also compare the routines in your production
      account to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare a 
      Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
      and select the package 'SR*3.0*185'.
  
      If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//,
      choose 'NO'.
  
      If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
