Subject: HL7 SEGMENT, WOUND CLASSIFICATION REPORT, CPT MODIFIER, SROSCH NAME

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses the 4 following issues:
  
 1.  When Surgery sends HL7 (Health Level-7) DG1 (Diagnosis) Segments to
     Ancillary systems, messages with other preoperative diagnoses have
     an incorrect value for the ICD diagnosis code.
 2.  When a Wound Classification Report is generated at an institution 
     that has only one (1) Active surgery site and the Active site isn't
     the installation's default institution, the report displays no data 
     regardless of the date range selected.
 3.  Surgery Post Operation and CPT/ICD Update/Verify options incorrectly
     allow CPT Modifier 51 to be entered on the Principle Procedure.
 4.  The Surgery Schedule of Operations report truncates the patient name
     inappropriately when its length is great than 23 characters.

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1. I9838915FY16 - HL7 Segment Defect
  
 Problem:
 --------
 HL7 (Health Level-7) DG1 (Diagnosis) Segments are created in order to
 send Surgery diagnosis data to an Ancillary System or Automated 
 Anesthesia Information System (AAIS).  When creating DG1 segments for
 other preoperative diagnoses, the Surgery code supplies an incorrect
 value for the ICD diagnosis code.
  
 The Surgery VistA code that creates the other preoperative diagnosis
 message segments accesses the wrong data record and consequently 
 retrieves the wrong value for the ICD diagnosis code.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine ^SRHLUO is modified to access the OTHER PREOP DIAGNOSIS 
 data (#130.17) in the SURGERY FILE (#130) correctly.
  
 Routines: SRHLUO
  
 2. I9898345FY16 - Wound Classification Report
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a Wound Classification Report [SROWC] is generated at an 
 institution that has only one (1) Active surgery site and the
 Active site isn't the installation's default institution, the
 report displays no data regardless of the date range selected.
 The report routine calls a surgery utility program to determine
 the surgery site for the report. When there is only one (1) Active
 surgery site, the utility program returns the value that is in the
 DEFAULT INSTITUTION field (#217) in the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS 
 FILE (#8989.3). The report uses that value when searching for data
 for the report. This technique is fine when the single Active site
 is the default institution.  When the Active site is not the 
 default institution, the program is unable to find any data for the
 report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine ^SROVAR is modified to return the Active site for the 
 report rather than the default institution for the installation when 
 there is a single Active Surgery site.
  
 Routines: SROVAR
  
 3. I9899652FY16 - CPT Modifier Defect
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The CPT Modifier 51 carries with it the stipulation that it cannot be 
 used in conjunction with the principal procedure code. Surgery Post 
 Operation [SROMEN-POST] and CPT/ICD Update/Verify menu [SRCODING 
 UPDATE/VERIFY MENU] options incorrectly allow CPT Modifier 51 to be
 entered on the Principal Procedure.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routines SROMOD and SROMOD0 to prevent the CPT Modifier 51
 (MULTIPLE PROCEDURES) from being selectable for the PRIN. PROCEDURE 
 CPT MODIFIER (#.01) field of the PRIN. PROCEDURE CPT MODIFIER 
 (#130.028) sub-file of the SURGERY (#130) file, and the PRIN 
 PROCEDURE CPT MODIFIER (#.01) field of the PRIN PROCEDURE CPT 
 MODIFIER (#136.01) sub-file of the SURGERY PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS CODE 
 (#136) file.
  
 Routines: SROMOD, SROMOD0
  
 4. I9898928FY16 - SROSCH Name Truncation
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Surgery Schedule of Operations report [SROSCH] truncates
 the patient name inappropriately when its length is great than 23
 characters.  Rather than printing the first 23 characters, the 
 routine prints the last name followed by a comma and a space 
 followed by the first character of the first name.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine SROSCH is modified to print the first 23 characters of 
 the patient name (last, first, middle).
