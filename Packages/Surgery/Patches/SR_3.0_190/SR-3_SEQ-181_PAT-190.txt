 I11231200FY17 - NIR Missing Fields
  
 Problem:
 --------
 VistA Surgery patch SR*3.0*184 added new fields to the SURGERY file 
 (#130) which display on the Time Out Verified Utilizing Checklist 
 [SROMEN-VERF] and the Nurse Intraoperative Report [SRONRPT].  These
 fields are required fields when PLANNED PRIN PROCEDURE CODE field 
 (#27) is set to a value that lies within a given range of CPT codes.
  
 Since the SR*3.0*184 patch install, when data for the new fields in
 the SURGERY file (#130) are entered and the SURGERY SITE PARAMETER: 
 NURSE INTROP REPORT is set to "PRINT TITLES WITH INFO ONLY" and the
 DEVICE(S) field (#31) is left blank; the Transplant/Donor section 
 is not displayed on the NIR.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine ^SRONRPT3 is modified to not skip the transplant/donor 
 information.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch 
    can be installed when Surgery users are on the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
          problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
       Following options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       To preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch prior
       to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' 
       option at this time. You may also compare the routines in your 
       production account to the routines in the patch by using the 
      'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' 
       Menu and select the package 'SR*3.0*190'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       YES//, choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
       And Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
 
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
 
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
 
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
 
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions
