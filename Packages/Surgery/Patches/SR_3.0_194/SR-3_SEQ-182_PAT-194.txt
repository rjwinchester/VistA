 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. INC0757492 - HOSPITAL ADMISSION STATUS field defaults to an inactive code.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the HOSPITAL ADMISSION STATUS field (#.011) is not included in the
 Surgery Site Parameter REQUIRED FIELDS FOR SCHEDULING: (MULTIPLE), running
 the Schedule Unrequested Operations [SROSRES] option, the Hospital
 Admission Status: prompt defaults to "I".
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A modification was made to the input template SRSCHED-UNREQUESTED-ICD10 to
 remove the default value. This matches how the field functions when the
 HOSPITAL ADMISSION STATUS (#.011) field IS included in the Surgery Site
 Parameter REQUIRED FIELDS FOR SCHEDULING: (MULTIPLE).
