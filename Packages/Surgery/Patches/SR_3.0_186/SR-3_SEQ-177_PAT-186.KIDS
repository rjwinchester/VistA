The patch addresses two (2) issues:

"BLD",10012,1,3,0)
1.   When a user edits the PROSTHESIS INSTALLED data for a completed
"BLD",10012,1,4,0)

"BLD",10012,1,5,0)

     [SROMENU] and answers "NO" when prompted to create an addendum,
"BLD",10012,1,7,0)
     an application error occurs.
"BLD",10012,1,8,0)
 
"BLD",10012,1,9,0)
2.   When a user edits Surgery Flag Interface Fields and enters a
"BLD",10012,1,10,0)
     caret ("^") to escape the edit session prior to completion, the
"BLD",10012,1,11,0)
