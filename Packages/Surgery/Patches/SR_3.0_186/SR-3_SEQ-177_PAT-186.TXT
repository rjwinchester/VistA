Subject: ADDENDUM ERROR, INTERFACE SETUP DEFECT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses two (2) issues:
  
 1.   When a user edits the PROSTHESIS INSTALLED data for a completed
      surgery case using the Operation option [SROMEN-OP] of the
      Operation Menu option [SROPER] of the Surgery Menu option
      [SROMENU] and answers "NO" when prompted to create an addendum,
      an application error occurs.
  
 2.   When a user edits Surgery Flag Interface Fields and enters a
      caret ("^") to escape the edit session prior to completion, the
      application erroneously adds a field delimiter to the selected
      category record in the SURGERY INTERFACE PARAMETER File (#133.2).

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC000001248855 - Addendum Error
   
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user edits the PROSTHESIS INSTALLED data for a completed surgery
 case using the Operation option [SROMEN-OP] of the Operation Menu option
 [SROPER] of the Surgery Menu option [SROMENU] and answers "NO" when
 prompted to create an addendum, an application error occurs. The software
 tries to restore the pre-edit PROSTHESIS INSTALLED data and errors out
 with an UNDEFINED in routine ^SROESNRA. This results in the changes being
 recorded in the VistA Surgery package but no addendum created in CPRS.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The error occurs because the routine SROESNR1 contains a comment table
 that does not contain a complete list of the Surgery File (#130)
 PROSTHESIS INSTALLED subfile (#130.01) fields. The program is modified to
 include all of the fields.
  
 Routines: SROESNR1
  
 2. INC000001261081 - Interface Setup Defect
   
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user edits Surgery Flag Interface Fields and enters a caret ("^")
 to escape the edit session prior to completion, the application
 erroneously adds a field delimiter to the selected category record in the
 SURGERY INTERFACE PARAMETER File (#133.2). The extra field delimiter
 displaces existing values into incorrect fields causing some fields to
 appear null or empty. This displacement occurs because the code in routine
 ^SRHLSCRN neglects to check for the return of a user entered caret ("^")
 after a call to the FileMan Reader API (^DIR).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The program ^SRHLSCRN is modified to check whether a caret ("^") is 
 returned by the call to ^DIR.  If it is, the modified code gracefully
 exits the application rather than continuing with the data update.
  
 ***Please Note***
  
 This patch corrects the defect created as a result of using the up-arrow 
 ("^") to exit the "Flag Interface Fields" [SRHL INTERFACE FLDS]  option.  
 Due to the pre-patch defect, the potential for corrupt data entries exists
 in the SURGERY INTERFACE PARAMATER file (#133.2). This would be unique to
 each site and is to be addressed by Field Implementation Service and
 local/regional VistA Application Support.

   ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes.
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
   1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
      select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
      that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
   5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
              Print Transport Global
              Compare Transport Global to Current System
              Backup a Transport Global
  
      To preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch prior to
      installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' option
      at this time. You may also compare the routines in your production
      account to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare a
      Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' 
      menu and select the package 'SR*3.0*186'.
  
      If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
      If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
      and Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
