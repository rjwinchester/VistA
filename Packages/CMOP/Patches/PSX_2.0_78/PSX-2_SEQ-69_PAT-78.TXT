 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 INC000001067413 - Controlled Substance Suspense
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site reported that after the DEA/Special Handling code is changed from 3 
 to 2 prescriptions are not going to CMOP like they shouldn't, but they 
 should be going into local suspense and they are not.
  
 Resolution:
 ------------
 Modified routine PSXMISC1 so the system will check for a 2 in the 
 DEA/Special handle field and place the prescription in local suspense... 
 Currently the system will only check for a 1.
