Subject: RPC Broker BDK - IPv6 Enabled Broker

Category: 
  - Informational
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Other

Description:
============

 Patch XWB*1.1*60 RPC Broker Development Kit (BDK) IPv6 Enabled, with 
 support for Delphi XE4, XE5, XE6, and XE7. This patch removes support for
 older versions of Delphi. This patch also deprecates the use of the 
 SharedBroker client for applications compiled with this new BDK.
  
 This patch is one in a series of patches to support the VA's transition 
 from IPv4 to IPv6.  IPv6 is a protocol designed to handle the growth rate 
 of the Internet and to cope with the demanding requirements of services,
 mobility, and end-to-end security.  
  
 There is no action for VHA sites required by this patch. This patch is
 Programmer-Only Client-Only.  There is no server side (VistA PackMan or
 KIDS) part to the patch.  There are no client side (Windows executable)
 programs for VHA production workstations.  The patch is intended for
 Delphi developer client workstations only.  The patch includes two 'beta'
 Windows executable programs to assist in development and testing, but
 these programs have not been field tested, have not received Section 508
 approval, nor have they been approved for installation on production
 workstations:
  
  * ClAgent.exe - An IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack implementation of the RPC Broker 
                  Client Agent, which is used for Auto Sign-On (when
                  enabled for the user in VistA). Note that Auto Sign-On
                  will work erratically when IPv6 is enabled on the VA
                  network, as VistA will see multiple IP addresses for the
                  workstation and consider them multiple workstations. In 
                  other words, IPv4 applications will only Auto Sign-On
                  with other IPv4 applications, and IPv6 applications will
                  only Auto Sign-On with other IPv6 applications.
  * ServerList.exe - A GUI tool to set registry entries for default VistA 
                  server(s). Users can set entries for their own defaults
                  only, while System Administrators can right-click (to run
                  as Administrator) and set entries for all users on that
                  workstation. It also allows setting the Secure Shell
                  (SSH) username for the VistA server, so that all GUI 
                  applications compiled with this new BDK will
                  automatically connect to VistA using Attachmate SSH.
  
 RPC Broker Patch XWB*1.1*60 provides Windows client support for IPv4/IPv6
 dual-stack environment using new Application Programmer Interfaces 
 (APIs).  This patch also upgrades from WinSock 1.1 to WinSock 2.2. By 
 using this BDK for development of a Delphi client application, the 
 application will be protocol independent and will be able to connect to 
 both IPv4 and IPv6 VistA servers.
  
 The old-style broker (where VistA calls back to a different port on the 
 client workstation when making a connection) is being deprecated in this 
 BDK. Applications compiled with this BDK will no longer be able to use 
 the old-style broker. The new-style broker (where VistA calls back to the 
 originating port on the client workstation) is the only broker style 
 supported by IPv6. The VistA listener will continue to support legacy GUI 
 applications that use the old-style broker until all applications have 
 migrated to the new-style broker. The new-style broker (where VistA calls 
 back to the originating port on the client workstation) is the preferred 
 use as it provides additional security not found in the old-style broker.
  
 The patch is distributed as a zip file (XWB_1_1_P60.zip) on the anonymous 
 directory sites.  The zip file contains all of the source code and 
 instructions for compiling and installing for each version of Delphi 
 listed above, as well as a few sample programs.
  
 The installation requires less than 30 Megabytes of disk space on a 
 workstation.

  INC000000063535 RPC Broker and multidivisional station numbers
  INC000000198176 RPC Broker always makes the main window visible
  INC000000758490 Upgrade RPC broker for IPv6
  INC000000901719 Security/Logon Issue from CPRS changing verify code
  
 1. INC000000063535 RPC Broker and multidivisional station numbers
  
 Problem:
 -------
 In testing CCOW implementation of CPRS at a multidivisional site, it was 
 discovered that the property RPCBroker.User.Division is not being 
 populated consistently. If the user has one division assigned, the 
 property contains "pointer to INSTITUTION file (#4)^institution 
 name^station number". If the user has multiple divisions assigned, the 
 property is populated with only the divisional station number without the 
 second or third pieces.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The software is working correctly.  The intended result is only to set 
 the DUZ(2) variable in the user's environment to the pointer to the 
 selected division in the INSTITUTION file (#4) and to update the sign-on 
 log.  Information regarding the selected division should be derived from 
 the DUZ(2) environment variable if it is required.
  
 2. INC000000198176 RPC Broker always makes the main window visible
  
 Problem:
 -------
 After connecting to the server and authenticating the user, RPC Broker 
 always makes the main window visible. The problem is that the Broker does 
 not examine the Application.ShowMainForm property. Therefore, if the main 
 form should not be shown during the application startup (or at all), then 
 there is no clean way to do this. Of course it is possible to hide the 
 form right after connecting to the server but this produces an unsightly 
 blip of the main form.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The suggested resolution cannot be incorporated into the Broker 
 Development Kit (BDK).  The MainForm property is derived from 
 vcl.Forms.TForm which does not include the ShowMainForm property.  The 
 ShowMainForm property is set in the main project file only when creating 
 a Delphi application, and is not available to the RPC Broker components 
 in the Broker Development Kit (BDK).
  
 3. INC000000758490 Upgrade RPC broker for IPv6
  
 Problem:
 -------
 A Federal Chief Information Office (CIO) memo "Transition to IPv6" 
 released in September of 2010 requires agencies to continue their IPv6 
 transition efforts and has established specific milestones associated 
 with enabling an IPv6 operational capability by the end of FY2014.  
 Microsoft has released WinSock APIs to provide IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack TCPIP 
 capability.  The RPC Broker client used by most VA GUI applications needs 
 to be upgraded to use these new APIs, and the VistA code modified to 
 support IPv6 addressing.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This patch upgrades VistA RPC Broker Development Kit (BDK) code to use
 new Windows IPv4/IPv6 APIs.  RPC Broker Client Agent (ClAgent.exe) and 
 Server List (ServerList.exe) applications to support IPv4/IPv6 will be
 developed and released under separate patch IDs using the new BDK.  'Beta'
 versions of these applications are included in this patch to assist
 developers in their programming and testing, but the applications should
 not be installed in a production environment as they have not been field
 tested in production.
  
 4. INC000000901719 Security/Logon Issue from CPRS changing verify code
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When the access and verify code are entered into CPRS in one string 
 (example "abcd123;vfcode*99") into the access code box, and the user is 
 prompted to change the verify code, then the box containing the old 
 verify code is not populated and the user cannot change the verify code.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The value entered in the access code box have been split into access code 
 and verify code values prior to being concatenated and sent to VistA for 
 authentication.  This provides the old data needed to be passed to the 
 form to change the verify code.  
  
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 Not applicable.  Not tested at field sites.  Not tested independently.  
 Patch contains shared code that is tested during GUI development and 
 deployment.  No production client-side or server-side software is 
 included.
