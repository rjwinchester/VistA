Subject: RPC BROKER IPv6 AND SECURITY UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch makes changes in Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker listener 
 processes to support emerging technologies and make bug fixes. These 
 changes include:
  
   1. IPv4/IPv6 Dual-Stack Implementation: This patch is one in a series of
      patches to support the VA's transition from IPv4 to IPv6. This patch
      updates one test routine where an IPv4 address format was 
      hard-coded. This has been replaced with a call to an IPv4/IPv6 
      dual-stack Application Programmer Interface (API). The modified
      routine is not used in production, but can be used by developers to
      test the RPC Broker listener.
   2. 2-Factor Authentication: VAIQ# 7613595 "Mandatory Use of PIV 
      Multifactor Authentication to VA Information System" dated June 30,
      2015, requires all VA IT systems to be PIV-enabled and requires the
      use of multifactor authentication when using a local, network, or
      remote account to log into a VA information system. This patch makes
      the "XUS IAM BIND USER" RPC available to all uses in any context to
      implement binding of the VistA user account to the user's Active
      Directory account using the Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      Binding application.
   3. RPC Availability and Documentation: The availability of Remote 
      Procedure Calls (RPCs) "XWB ARE RPCS AVAILABLE" (ICR #3012) and "XWB
      GET VARIABLE VALUE" (ICR #1629) have been changed from 'PUBLIC' to
      'SUBSCRIPTION' due to security concerns. Kernel RPC Broker developers
      need to know which external packages are using these RPCs as
      additional security is added in future patches. Future testing will
      be conducted with all subscribed external packages whenever changes
      are made to the RPCs. Also, RPCs "XWB CREATE CONTEXT" (ICR #1751) and
      "XWB IS RPC AVAILABLE" (ICR #3011) have had their descriptions
      updated to match current documentation practices.
   4. Routine Documentation: Several routines have had comment line #3 
      added or updated to reflect VA policy for routines that should not be
      modified.
   5. Use of XTMP Global: The ^XTMP global was specifically designed to 
      persist data from one process to another, but was being killed when
      RPC Broker transmitted the return data array. This patch changes the
      SNDDATA^XWBRW API to not kill the ^XTMP global according to current
      VA software design policy.

 Clearance - 06/16/16
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch XWB*1.1*64 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in ProPath standard titled BBM Team 
 Review of VistA Patches. This patch does not alter or modify any VistA
 Blood Bank software design safeguards or safety critical elements
 functions.
   
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch XWB*1.1*64 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

  I5511189FY15 INC000000758490 RPC Broker Support for IPv6
  I5560725FY15 INC000000469478 XTMP Global entry killed in error
  
 1. I5511189FY15 INC000000758490 RPC Broker Support for IPv6
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Currently, all of VA's internal and external infrastructure and 
 applications are set to IPv4 as the default transport mode.  The format 
 is different between IPv4 and IPv6.  Kernel and several other 
 applications process IP addresses in routines and need to store the IP 
 addresses in files.  Each of these fields will need to change their field 
 definition (data dictionary) to handle the longer IPv6 format.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This patch uses Kernel APIs introduced in XU*8.0*605 to replace 
 hard-coded IPv4 address handling in one routine.
  
  
 2. I5560725FY15 INC000000469478 XTMP Global entry killed in error
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The ^XTMP global was specifically designed to persist data from one 
 process to another, but it is being killed when RPC Broker transmits the 
 return array and must be rebuilt if the data is to be used by subsequent 
 RPC calls.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This patch changes the SNDDATA^XWBRW API to not kill the ^XTMP global 
 when the return array is transmitted.

 ----------
 Field test waiver: No field testable components included in patch.
