Subject: RUM FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes a bug that caused the RPC Broker to not call the VistA 
 System Monitor (VSM) data collection routine.  Previously, a change to an 
 array subscript was made that change needs to be reflected in the 2 lines 
 of the routines in the RPC Broker code that call the VSM. Without this 
 change, VSM metrics related to RPC calls cannot be collected.

 Problem:
 --------
 A change was made to an array within the RPC Broker code.  Specifically, 
 the "CAPI" array subscript was changed to "RPC".  However, this change 
 was not made in two lines of code where the call to the VistA System 
 Monitor (VSM) is made.  The result is that metrics collected on behalf of 
 RPC calls are not attributed properly to their respective RPC calls.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modify routines XWBPRS and XWBBRK2 with array subscript being evaluated.
 From:
 I $G(XWB(2,"CAPI"))]"" D LOGRSRC^%ZOSV(XWB(2,"CAPI"),2,1)
 To:
 I $G(XWB(2,"RPC"))]"" D LOGRSRC^%ZOSV(XWB(2,"RPC"),2,1)

 Backout and Rollback Procedure:
 -------------------------------
 This patch consists of routines only. During the VistA Installation 
 Procedure of the KIDS build, the installer should back up the

 action (step 3a in the Installations Instructions below).
  
 If rollback/backout is required, the installer can restore the routines
 using the MailMan message that were saved prior to installing the patch.
 The changes to the data dictionaries and form are backward compatible.
