Subject: ECS FY 2015 SUSTAINMENT UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Following the release of the Event Capture FY 2015 Sustainment patch 
 EC*2*126, a problem was discovered with the filtering logic and the use 
 of the INSTITUTION field in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file.
  
 A change was made in two places of the software as it relates to 
 filtering, or limiting, the choices presented to the user.  This was done 
 to reduce the potential for selecting the incorrect clinic or appointment.
  
 The issue is that the institution is not routinely populated for entries 
 in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file.  As a result, clinics and appointments are 
 inappropriately being removed from the selection list.
  
 Problem #1: The recent visits box doesn't show appointments as expected.

   ASSOCIATED NSR:
   ===============
   N/A
  
   Problem:  
   --------
   When building the list of appointments for the recent visits box, the 
   location selected by the user is compare against the institution
   associated with the appointment's clinic.  As the institution isn't
   reliably filled in for a clinic, the appointment may be left off the
   list when it shouldn't be.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The logic will be changed so that the institution will be obtained from
   the division associated with the clinic.  Each clinic must have a 
   division and each division must have an institution.  This will give us
   a reliable location to get the institution from to compare against the
   selected location for event capture workload.
  
 Problem #2: When editing event code screens you may receive an error 
 stating that the default associated clinic is inactive.

   Problem:
   --------
   When determining which clinics can be associated with an event code
   screen a comparison is made between the location selected and the
   institution of the clinic. As the institution isn't reliably filled in
   for a clinic, the clinic may be incorrectly identified as inactive or
   unavailable for selection.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The logic will be changed so that the institution will be obtained from
   the division associated with the clinic.  Each clinic must have a 
   division and each division must have an institution.  This will give us
   a reliable location to get the institution from to compare against the
   selected location for the event code screen.
