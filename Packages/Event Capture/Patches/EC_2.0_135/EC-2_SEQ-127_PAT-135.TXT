  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ================
  1. I10488741FY16 - Mid-FY17 Inactive Stop Code DSS Unit Review
   
     Problem:
     --------
     The Managerial Cost Accounting Office (MCAO) requested that DSS Units
     in the DSS UNIT (#724) file with SEND TO PCE (#13) field set to 
     'Send No Records' and have an inactive/invalid Stop Code be automatically 
     inactivated.
    
     Resolution:
     -----------
     This patch will queue the post-install routine, EC2P135, to run at 
     04/01/17 at 1:00 AM.  This routine will make a call to the    
     CHKDSS^ECUTL3 API to scan the DSS UNIT (#724) file and inactivate 
     any DSS Units with SEND TO PCE (#13) field set to 'Send No Records' 
     and have an inactive/invalid Stop Code. If this patch is installed
     after 04/01/17 at 1:00 AM, the post-install routine will queue
     immediately.
    
     A MailMan message will be sent to the installer of the patch and to 
     holders of the 'ECMGR' security key. A sample message is below:
