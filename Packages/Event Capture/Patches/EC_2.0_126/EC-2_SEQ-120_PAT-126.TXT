Description:
============

 The Managerial Cost Accounting Office (MCAO) requests modifications to
 the Event Capture System that would provide the field with improved data
 entry capabilities so that accurate costing information can be gathered
 nationally.  This patch contains the modifications for Fiscal Year 2015.
  
 Functional Overview
 ===================
  
 1)  Enhance backspace key functionality in the procedure reasons drop down
     box for the data entry by patient, data entry by procedure and 
     multiple dates/procs options. The backspace key will now remove one
     character per key press from the selected reason.
  
 2)  Modify the DSS Unit Activity Report, all versions, to allow for the 
     full procedure name as well as the synonym to appear on the report.
  
 3)  Modify the Ordering Section Summary report to allow for the full
     procedure name as well as the synonym to appear on the report.
  
 4)  Modify the Provider (1-7) Summary Report to allow for DSS Unit and 
     location selection.  Add the DSS Unit and location, as well as the 
     CPT modifier volume used to the export version of the report.
  
 5)  Modify the procedure codes drop down box in the data entry by patient,
     data entry by procedure, and the multiple dates/procs options so that 
     procedures appear in correct alphanumeric order.
  
 6)  Modify the Event Capture Encounters Report so that the report doesn't
     produce a <store> error when all units for all locations are run for a
     long date range. A warning has been added to the report selection 
     screen advising against the use of all units and all locations across
     a long date range as a system time out my be encountered if the report
     processing takes too long.
  
 7)  Modify Procedure Reasons List.  Update reason CHAP PRRP to CHAP
     PRRP/PRTP INP/OUT.  Also, add new reasons CHAP MIL SEXUAL TRAUMA and 
     CHAP DOM/TREATMENT CENTERS.
  
 8)  Modify Event Capture Encounters Report so that it is no longer 
     restricted to holders of the ECMGR key.
  
 9)  Reorganize the Event Capture User Manual.  The User Manual is being 
     updated to clarify the security keys available and what their function
     is.  In addition, the reports section will be updated to show which 
     reports may be seen by all users and those that may only be seen by
     those who hold the ECMGR key.
  
 10) Modify DSS User Access Report so that only holders of the ECMGR key 
     may access it.
  
 11) Modify the Inactive Person Class Report so that only holders of the 
     ECMGR key may access it.
  
 12) Modify PCE Data Summary Report so that it is accessible without the   
     ECMGR key.
  
 13) Modify PCE Data Summary Report to replace "DSS ID" in the header of 
     the report with "Stop Code".
  
 14) Modify volume field in the Data Entry by Patient, Data Entry by 
     Procedure, and Multiple Dates/Procedures options so that it now
     displays a hover hint.  In addition, basic help information for the
     screen (available from the help button) was modified to include
     updated volume information. Finally, field specific help (available by
     pressing the F1 key when cursor is in the volume field) has also been
     updated.
  
 15) Migrate Event Capture GUI to Delphi XE.  The Event Capture 
     application has been updated to run on the Delphi XE platform, 
     putting it in line with other Vista GUI applications.
  
 16) Modify the description of the Event Code Screen option on the 
     Management Menu to include "or copy".  It now says "add, update, or 
     copy event code screens".
  
 17) Modify the Event Code Screen setup screen so that only active clinics
     from the selected location are available in the default associated 
     clinic drop down box.
  
 18) Modify Data Entry by Patient option so that only recent visits 
     associated with the same location as the EC screen can be selected.
  
 19) Modify the EC setup creen so that the primary stop code, credit stop 
     code, and CHAR4 code appear to the right of the clinic name in the 
     default associated clinic drop down box.
  
 20) Enable single sign on from within the event capture GUI.  Event
     capture now identifies users that are already logged into another 
     Vista package and automatically signs them into the event capture GUI.
  
 21) Modify the DSS unit setup screen so that a DSS unit that is 
     identified as a "no records" unit will allow for user selection of a 
     credit stop code as well as a CHAR4 code.
  
 22) Do not store 0 (zero) for associated clinic when there is no  
     associated clinic for the workload entered.  Modified storage of data
     into the EVENT CAPTURE PATIENT file (#721) so that when there isn't an
     associated clinic, a value of null is stored.
  
 23) Modify the Procedure Reasons Report so that it displays the procedure
     name on both the print and export versions as well as displaying the
     DSS unit IEN on the export version.
  
 24) Modify the Print Category and Procedure Summary Report to include the
     DSS unit, DSS department, and DSS unit send status (all records, 
     outpatient only, or no records) in the header.  In addition, add the 
     procedure synonym and the clinic IEN to the report.
  
 25) Update user documentation to include screen shots of the exported 
     reports for the Print Category and Procedure Summary Report and the
     Event Capture Encounters Report.
  
 26) Update all Event Capture manuals and documentation replacing DSS ID
     or DSS Identifier with Stop Code.
  
 27) Modify report listing so that manager and non-manager reports are 
     grouped together.  In addition, within each category reports are now
     listed in alphabetical order.
