Subject: ECS FY 2014 ANNUAL SUSTAINMENT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Decision Support System (DSS) Program office requests modifications to
 the Event Capture System that would provide the field with improved data
 entry capabilities so that accurate costing information can be gathered
 nationally.  This patch contains the modifications for Fiscal Year 2014.
  
 Functional Overview
 ===================
  
 1) Add 32 Chaplain specific reasons to the EC PROCEDURE REASON (#720.4) 
    file.  The new entries will be added via the post-install process and
    all new entries will start with CHAP.
  
 2) Modify Category and Procedure Summary report.  This report is being
    updated to include Stop Code, Credit Stop Code, and CHAR4 Code.  The
    new fields will be included on both the printed report and the
    exportable report.
  
 3) Modify Event Capture Encounters report.  This report is being updated
    to include the Clinic Name, Stop Code, Credit Stop Code, and CHAR4 
    Code.  The new fields will be included on both the printed report and
    the exportable report.
  
 4) Inactivate event code screens that are related to inactive EC Procedure
    codes.  During the post-install process a check of all event code
    screens will be done in a "report only" mode.  An email will be sent
    to all holders of the ECMGR key, as well as the person installing the
    patch.  That email will identify any screens that are associated with
    an inactive EC Procedure code.  The process will run again in 3 days 
    when installing in a mirror account, or in 30 days if installing in a
    production account, and will inactivate any event code screens that
    are associated with inactive EC Procedure Codes.  Again, the holders
    of the ECMGR key, as well as the person who installed the patch, will
    receive an email indicating any action taken.  
  
    In the future, if EC Procedure codes are inactivated via patch,
    associated event code screens will be inactivated without a warning
    message. An email message will still be sent indicating the action
    taken.
  
    Finally, if a locally created EC Procedure code is inactivated, all
    associated event code screens will be automatically inactivated with an
    email being sent indicating any action taken.
  
 5) Do not list historical visits in the recent visit selection box.  The
    software has been updated so that visits that are identified as being
    historical will not be included in the recent visits list when entering
    workload via the Event Capture software.  This will stop workload from
    being applied to the incorrect visit.
  
 6) Routine ECRRPT was updated in the EC FY13 sustainment patch.  At that
    time the second line of the routine was incorrectly updated and a
    previous patch designation was accidentally removed.  That patch has
    been added back so that the second line of the routine now correctly
    shows the patches that have been applied to this routine.

 Installation Instructions
 ========================= 
  
 Pre-Installation Items:
 =======================
  
 * Environment Check:
      
   Programmer access is required for installing this patch.
  
   ** NOTE ** -- Prior to installation, the installer must ensure the  
                 DUZ(0) node of the DUZ array is set to the "@" symbol.
   
 * Users On the System:
    
   This patch modifies routines used by the Event Capture application and
   may affect many users.
  
   This patch may be installed with users on the system, but should be
   loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to users and to
   reduce the possibility of errors when the routines are updated.
  
   If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the
   following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their
   descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running
   the KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
         EC GUI Context version 2.1.3.5   ... EC GUI CONTEXT
    
 * Software Installation Time:
  
   The estimated installation time is less than 5 minutes during off peak
   hours.
  
 * Required Builds:
    
   The following is a list of REQUIRED builds for this KIDS
   distribution.  KIDS will not allow the installation of this patch
   without their prior installation.
  
   Required Build(s):
   ------------------
   EC*2*119
   EC*2*107
  
 Post-Install Items:
 ===================
  
 **PLEASE NOTE**
  
 A post-install check of the EC EVENT CODE SCREENS (#720.3) file will 
 identify any screens that are associated with an inactive EC NATIONAL 
 PROCEDURE (#725) code.  Holders of the ECMGR key will get an email 
 indicating the results of the check.  The first scan will be in "report 
 only" mode indicating any screens that are using inactive EC procedure 
 codes.  The same scan will be queued for 30 days after installation (3
 days when installed in a mirror/test account) that will automatically
 inactivate the screens.  An email will be sent at that time to the holders
 of the ECMGR key indicating any screens that were inactivated.
  
 Installation Steps:
 ===================
   
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
   2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
  
   3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options

          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
       d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
