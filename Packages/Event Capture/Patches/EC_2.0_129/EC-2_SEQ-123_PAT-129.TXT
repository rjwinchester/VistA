Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following three (3) remedy issues:
  1. <SYNTAX>GET+2^ECOB error.
  2. Remove EVENT CAPTURE PROCEDURE File (#720) and EVENT CODE SCREENING 
     File (#720.2) flagged for deletion in patch EC*2*5.

 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
  
 1. INC528014 - <SYNTAX>GET+2^ECOB error
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    Site reported seeing the GET+2^ECOB error in the error trap sporadically 
    several times during the day. Users at one site reported seeing the error
    when the Event Capture GUI application is being closed. Typically, it's the
    system folks that notice the errors and not the EC GUI users. Attempts
    to duplicate the error have not been successful. The error occurs because 
    the global node, ^XTMP("ECOBUF",DUZ,n) referred to as the handle is missing
    when passed as an input parameter for a Remote Procedure Call (RPC).
    This handle gets built by a previous RPC call. For example at a site,
    one will notice the handle ^XTMP("ECOBUF",11111,1) missing but global
    nodes ^XTMP("ECOBUF",11111,2), ^XTMP("ECOBUF",11111,3), etc. are
    intact.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines ECOB and ECOBU were modified to prevent the error from occurring.
  
  
 2. INC540311
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    Site has requested the removal of EVENT CAPTURE PROCEDURE File (#720) and
    EVENT CODE SCREENING File (#720.2) flagged for deletion in patch EC*2*5.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------- 
    According to Event Capture Release Notes for EC*2*5, Files (#720) and
    (#720.2) were flagged and would be deleted in a future patch. Routine 
    EC2P129 will remove the files along with data and associated templates.
  
  
 3. INC764353 - DSS Unit with inactive Event Code Screens selectable
                      
    Problem: 
    --------
    Site reported that when an Event Capture location has an active DSS unit 
    but the event code screen associated with that DSS unit are inactive,
    then the DSS unit is presented as selectable in the ECS GUI patient
    entry options.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine UNTCHK^ECUERPC that is linked to RPC, EC GETUSRDSSUNIT.
    This RPC returns a list of active DSS units based on a specified location 
    and user. A check was added to determine the active status of Event Code 
    Screens associated with a DSS Unit. If there are no active event code 
    screens associated with a DSS Unit, then the DSS Unit is not returned
    in the RPC list.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but it is recommended 
 that it be queued to run after normal business hours.
  
 Install Time - less than 3 minutes.
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
   
  
 This patch will kill the unsubscripted globals ^ECP and ^ECK. On a Cache 
 system, the prevention of unsubscripted global kills is a system wide 
 setting that must be modified using the $ZU command. If unsubscripted global
 kill is disabled, at the programmer prompt, issue the following command to 
 enable unsubscripted global kills:
  
            >S X=$ZU(68,28,0)
  
   
  1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the
     INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
  2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
     the Installation menu.  
  
  3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EC*2.0*129)
   
         a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option allows
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
             transport global.
         b.  Print Transport Global - This option allows you to view
             the components of the KIDS build.
         c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option 
             allows you to view all changes that are made when this 
             patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
             (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
         d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option creates a backup
             message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
             backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
       EC*2.0*129.
   
    5. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       NO//", respond NO.  
  
    6. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
       and Protocols? NO//", respond NO.
  
  NOTE: After the patch is installed, delete the routine EC2P129 by using
        Delete Routine [XTRDEL] option.
  
        On a Cache system, if the global protection was removed prior to 
        installing the patch. This protection needs to be reinstated
        using the $ZU command. At the programmer prompt, issue the following
        command to disable unsubscripted global kills:
  
          >S X=$ZU(68,28,1)
