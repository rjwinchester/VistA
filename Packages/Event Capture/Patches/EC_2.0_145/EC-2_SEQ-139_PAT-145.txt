  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Managerial Cost Accounting Office (MCAO) requests modifications to
 the Event Capture System that would provide the field with improved data
 entry capabilities so that accurate costing information can be gathered
 nationally.  This patch contains the modifications for Fiscal Year 2019
  
 Functional Overview
 ===================
  
 1) Added "VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION" to the MEDICAL SPECIALTY file (#723).
  
 2) Modified the Event Code Screen option under the Management Menu to
    allow filtering of event code screens by status (active/inactive).
  
 3) Modified the Event Code Screens with CPT Codes report to include the
    associated clinic's stop code, credit stop code and CHAR4 information.
  
 4) Fixed an issue where older, incorrectly set up DSS units would appear
    in the DSS units listing in the Event Code Screens set up option but
    did not appear in the DSS Unit option under the Management Menu. All
    DSS units are reviewed as part of the patch installation to ensure
    they're correctly set up.  An email is sent to holders of the ECMGR key
    with the results of the review.
  
 5) Added the ability to "cancel" the exporting of a report to Excel.  The
    user can now stop the exporting of a report prior to completion of the
    export.
  
 6) Modified the Data Entry by Patient and Data Entry by Procedure options
    so that the form is inactive until a valid date/time is entered.  Once
    a valid date/time is entered the remainder of the form will be
    available for data entry.
  
 7) Modified the regular spreadsheet upload process to ensure that the
    standard Event Capture spreadsheet template is being used for upload.
  
 8) Modified column sorting on all grids so that numerical based columns
    are sorted numerically rather than alphanumerically.  This will ensure
    that columns are sorted as expected, in numerical order.
  
 9) For any exported report where the title of the report appeared in row
    one of the Excel spreadsheet, the title has been removed from row one.
    This information will now appear in the worksheet tab in Excel.
  
 10) Modified the Same Procedure, Multiple Patient data entry screen so 
     that attempting to change the primary diagnosis field doesn't cause
     an error.  Previously, if the primary diagnosis field was auto 
     populated, it would cause an error if you attempted to change it.
  
 11) Modified the Event Capture Encounters Report so that the volume 
     reported is the total procedure volume for the encounter.
  
 12) Fixed a problem where a multi-divisional user may be prompted for 
     access credentials when using the Event Capture Interface from the
     CPRS tools menu.  Event Capture Interface will now open when started
     from the CPRS tools menu without forcing re-entry of credentials.
  
 13) Improvements were made throughout the application related to screen
     reader and dictation software usage.
  
 14) Fixed an issue where the date/time field would be automatically set
     to the current date/time ("now") when an invalid date/time was
     entered.  The default date/time of "now" should not be automatically
     entered when the DSS unit is not defined with a default date/time of
     "now".
  
 15) Increased the time allowed before closing Event Capture due to 
     inactivity from 10 seconds to 30 seconds.
  
 16) Fixed an issue in several reports where the DSS unit may not match the
     unit selected by the user.  If the DSS unit had a UNIT NUMBER assigned
     that matched the Internal Entry Number (IEN) of a different DSS unit,
     the incorrect DSS unit would be used in the report.
  
 17) Modified all reports so that the user can choose to export the report
     from the print preview screen.
  
 18) Fixed an issue where future visits were showing in the 'recent visits'
     box during data entry by patient. In some cases, there were so many
     future visits listed that the user couldn't find today's visits.
     Modified the 'recent visits' box so that it will only show future
     visits through the end of the day, in addition to recent past visits.
  
 19) Modified the data entry process so that workload can be entered for a
     future visit if the visit date/time is prior to midnight of the
     current day.
  
 20) Modified the state home spreadsheet entry process so that if only one
     DSS unit is available for the selected location that the DSS unit is
     automatically selected.  Prior to the change, the DSS unit would 
     display but not be selected until the user clicked on it.
  
 21) Modified the state home spreadsheet upload process so that patients
     in the adjudicated SC rate category are assigned the SN200, SD200, or
     SH200 feeder key value.
