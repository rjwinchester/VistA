Description:
============

 The Managerial Cost Accounting Office (MCAO) requests modifications to
 the Event Capture System that would provide the field with improved data
 entry capabilities so that accurate costing information can be gathered
 nationally.  This patch contains the modifications for Fiscal Year 2018.
  
 Functional Overview
 ===================
  
 1) Modify the GUI spreadsheet upload interface to include a speed button
    for changing the duplicate threshold.
  
 2) Modify the GUI spreadsheet upload interface so that all menu items 
    display their corresponding speed button to the left of the command.
  
 3) Modify the GUI spreadsheet upload interface so that when a user closes
    the upload form all existing data within the cells is cleared.
  
 4) Modify the spreadsheet upload logic so that locations are only 
    identified by their station number (STA6).
  
 5) Modify the spreadsheet upload interface so that the cursor remains
    visible when editing data within a cell.
  
 6) Modify the spreadsheet upload interface to allow use of spreadsheets 
    created using Microsoft 365.
  
 7) Modify the spreadsheet upload interface so that the column headers of
    the cell grid match the column headers on the Event Capture spreadsheet
    upload template.
  
 8) Modify the two factor authentication (2FA) login interface so that
    Event Capture doesn't launch when the user cancels out of the 2FA 
    process.  While Event Capture opened, it was in an unusable state.
  
 9) Modify the location option on the manager's menu to change the listing
    of locations so that the 'current locations' (those identified as being
    used by Event Capture) appear at the top of the list. The rest of the 
    list will be sorted alphabetically.
  
 10) Modify spreadsheet upload interface to disallow, by DSS Unit, 
     duplicate workload entry.
  
 11) Add a new report called Possible Late State Home Entries Report to 
     the reports menu.
  
 12) Modify the Event Code Screens with CPT Codes Report, both printed and 
     exported, to include the synonym, associated clinic, and MCA Labor
     Code.
  
 13) Modify the Event Code Screens with CPT Codes Report 
     selection interface to change the existing "select" label with "CPT
     Codes".
  
 14) Modify the Print Category and Procedure Summary Report to allow the 
     user to select a DSS Unit status (active, inactive, or both) and to
     be able to select one, many, or all DSS Units.
  
 15) Modify the Print Category and Procedure Summary Report selection 
     interface to change the existing "select" label with "Event Code 
     Screens".
  
 16) Modify the Event Capture Encounters Report, both printed and 
     exported, to include the MCA Labor Code.
  
 17) Modify the Patient Summary Report, both printed and exported, to 
     include the MCA Labor Code.
  
 18) Modify the Disabled Category and Procedure Summary Report, both 
     printed and exported, to include the MCA Labor Code.
  
 19) Modify the Print Category and Procedure Summary Report, both printed
     and exported, to include the MCA Labor Code.
  
 20) Modify the PCE Data Summary Report, both printed and exported, to
     include the MCA Labor Code, Credit Stop and CHAR4 code.
  
 21) Modify the export report process to allow users with Microsoft 365 to
     export reports.
  
 22) Modify the Event Capture GUI interface so that it retains column grid
     sizing, by user, for subsequent logons to the interface.
  
 23) Modify the spreadsheet upload process to store the date/time the 
     record was uploaded.
  
 24) Modify the three patient data entry options to expand the provider 
     selection area to allow more potential choices to be listed.
  
 25) Modify the three patient data entry options to add a placeholder for
     Camp Lejeune encounter related activity.  This is in preparation for
     the eventual release of Camp Lejeune related updates.

   following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their
   descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running
   the KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
