Description:
============

 The Managerial Cost Accounting Office (MCAO) requests modifications to
 the Event Capture System that would provide the field with improved data
 entry capabilities so that accurate costing information can be gathered
 nationally.  This patch contains the modifications for Fiscal Year 2017.
  
 Functional Overview
 ===================
  
 1) Modify the GUI so that columns on grid displays are auto-sized
    whenever the size of the form is manipulated or the GUI is maximized.
  
 2) Modify the GUI so that scroll bars are available when resizing grids 
    results in more data available than will fit on one screen.
  
 3) Modify the GUI so that when reports are run they are brought to the 
    foreground upon completion rather than appearing in the background
    under the main Event Capture window.
  
 4) Update the names of the locations available for use within Event 
    Capture so they match the current names from the INSTITUTION file. 
    Upon installation, any names that don't match will be corrected and
    a list of the changes will be sent via Vista email to all holders of
    the ECMGR key.
  
 5) Modify Event Capture to allow for non licensed providers to be 
    selectable as providers when the DSS unit is set to 'send no records' 
    to PCE. Event Capture managers will be able to identify users who may
    be selected as providers through the new 'providers' option in the GUI.
  
 6) Modify the GUI so that caption list boxes are displayed correctly, thus
    allowing screen readers to function properly.
  
 7) Modify Event Capture so that test patient data can be removed from the 
    EVENT CAPTURE PATIENT file.  A new option, available to ECMGR key 
    holders, will allow for deletion of test patient data, so that it does
    not appear on any reports.  This deletion will not include test 
    patients with workload related to the CH103 to CH109 procedure codes.
    Upon installation, if the patch is being installed in a production
    account, test patient data will be deleted and a Vista email will be
    sent to holders of the ECMGR key.  The automatic deletion will not
    occur in test/mirror accounts.
  
 8) Modify the patient summary report so that it includes the associated
    clinic name, stop code, credit stop code, and CHAR4 code.
  
 9) Modify the DSS unit activity report so that it includes the associated
    clinic name, stop code, credit stop code, and CHAR4 code.
  
 10) Modify the copy event code screen functionality so that when selecting
     a target DSS unit, you can see what you're typing and the list will
     update as you type.
  
 11) Modify the spreadsheet upload utility so that it no longer considers
     values entered into the DSS unit number column.  As the DSS unit 
     number isn't unique, it can't be used to identify the DSS unit.
  
 12) Modify the spreadsheet upload utility so that deleting a row is
     consistent with Windows standards.
  
 13) Modify the spreadsheet upload utility so that standard Windows editing
     options, such as insert column, delete column, and undo, are 
     available.
  
 14) Modify the procedure option on the management menu so that a holder of
     the ECMGR key can delete the CPT code associated with a local
     procedure.
  
 15) Modify the patient data entry options so that the default provider
     shown is correct based on the DSS unit and the person entering the
     workload.  If the person entering the workload is a licensed provider 
     then they will be the default.  If the person entering the workload 
     is not a licensed provider then they will be default if the DSS unit
     is set to not send records to PCE and they've been identified as a
     non licensed provider.  If the user is a non licensed provider 
     and cannot be the default then the system will check the last provider
     they referenced and if that person is selectable, they will be the
     default.  If no provider can be identified then the default will be
     blank.
  
 16) Modify the patient data entry options so that all service connected
     labels are consistently displayed.  Previously, some service connected
     labels had question marks and some did not.  All question marks have
     been removed from the labels.
  
 17) Modify the spreadsheet upload utility so that all errors can be
     loaded into a spreadsheet of upload errors.  Previously, only service
     connected errors could be loaded.  It will now include all errors.
  
 18) Modify the location and DSS unit options on the manager's menu so
     that the lists can be searched.
  
 19) Modify the patient data entry options so that invalid times cannot be
     entered.  Previously, if you entered an invalid time you could still
     get the system to accept the record by bypassing the warnings and then
     adding the record.  If a bad date/time is entered the field will be
     reset to the current date/time rather than allowing the bad date/time
     to remain in the field.
  
 20) Modify the data entry by procedure option to retain the data entered
     in the selection criteria side of the form (the left side) once a 
     record has been added.  The data on the left side should remain
     static while new patients for that procedure are added on the right
     side of the screen.
  
 21) Remove any reference to file 722 that may currently exist on the host
     site.  A new file is being added as file number 722.  This file
     number was previously used by Event Capture but should have been
     deleted in a previous update.  An environmental check is made at
     installation time to remove any references to the old file 722.
  
 22) Modify the state home spreadsheet upload utility to keep track of all
     records added through this option.  This change, along with a future
     Decision Support Software (DSS) change, will allow for counting of
     "late" state home records when running the Event Capture extract.
  
 23) Modify the Event Capture GUI to allow for two factor authentication 
     (2FA) to be used to authenticate users.
