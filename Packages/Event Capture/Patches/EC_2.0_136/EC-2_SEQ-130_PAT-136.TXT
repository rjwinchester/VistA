  CA SDM OVERVIEW:
  ================
  1. I13369965FY17 - FY18 Inactive Stop Code DSS Unit Review 
   
     Problem:
     --------
     The Managerial Cost Accounting Office (MCAO) requested that DSS Units
     in the DSS UNIT (#724) file with SEND TO PCE (#13) field set to 
     'Send No Records' and have an inactive/invalid Stop Code be automatically 
     inactivated.
    
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Post install routine EC2P136, in this patch, will queue the call to the
     CHKDSS^ECUTL3 API to scan the DSS UNIT (#724) file and inactivate 
     any DSS Units with SEND TO PCE (#13) field set to 'Send No Records' and 
     have an inactive/invalid Stop Code.   
  
     A MailMan message will be sent to the installer of the patch and to 
     holders of the 'ECMGR' security key. A sample message is below:
