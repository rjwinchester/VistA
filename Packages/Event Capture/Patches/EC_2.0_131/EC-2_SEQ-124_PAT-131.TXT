Description:
============

 The Managerial Cost Accounting Office (MCAO) requests modifications to
 the Event Capture System that would provide the field with improved data
 entry capabilities so that accurate costing information can be gathered
 nationally.  This patch contains the modifications for Fiscal Year 2016.
  
 Functional Overview
 ===================
  
 1) Modify the GUI so that all forms, buttons, etc. display correctly when
    a user changes their screen resolution.
  
 2) Modify the GUI so that alternate font sizes can be selected while
    maintaining the integrity of all forms, buttons, etc.
  
 3) Correct grid displays so that they are lined up correctly regardless
    of column or row sizing.
  
 4) Require active and valid stop codes for any DSS unit set to send no
    records to PCE.  Upon installation any existing DSS units that are set
    to send no records to PCE and have an invalid or inactive stop code
    will be inactivated.  A report of any changes will be sent to holders
    of the ECXMGR key during patch installation. DSS units can be
    reactivated using the event capture software.
  
 5) Create a new report that lists all DSS units that are set to send no 
    records to PCE.  The report will show the DSS unit and the assigned
    stop code.  If the credit stop and CHAR4 code are assigned they will
    also be listed.  This report is only available for holders of the 
    ECXMGR key.
  
  
 6) Eliminate the recent visits pop window when entering patient data if 
    the DSS unit is set to send no records to PCE.
  
 7) Modified the software so that event code screens have their default
    associated clinic removed when a related DSS unit has its send to PCE
    setting changed from all records to no records.
  
 8) Modified the event code screen set up so that the default associated
    clinic box is inactive if the DSS unit is set to send no records to
    PCE.
  
 9) Modified the send to PCE field for the DSS unit so that the outpatient
    only option is no longer available.  Any existing DSS units that are
    set to outpatient only will be changed to all records.  A report will
    be sent to holders of the ECXMGR key during patch installation if any
    DSS units are updated.
  
 10) Modified the DSS unit screen so that categories can be disallowed.  
     For DSS units that are already set up with event code screens that 
     contain categories, the site may remove the use of categories by
     changing the 'allow category use' field from yes to no.  This allows
     sites to remove the use of categories for this specific DSS unit.
     Existing event code screens will be inactivated and retained for
     historical purposes while equivalent event code screens without 
     categories will be created for the DSS unit.
  
 11) Modified the print category and procedure summary report to include
     the DSS unit IEN (Internal Entry Number) as part of the report.
  
 12) Created a new report called disabled category and procedure 
     summary report that will display any DSS units that have had their
     category use changed from yes to no.  The report will show existing
     event code screen information as well as the historical event code
     screens that contained categories.
  
 13) Modified the spreadsheet upload process to allow for the selection of
     more than one provider by name or IEN, allow addition of CPT modifiers
     as appropriate, allow selection of clinic by name or IEN, and allow
     entry of service connected information.
  
 14) Modified the state home spreadsheet upload to improve usability during
     monthly uploads.
  
 15) Modified the event capture encounter report so the user sees a pop up
     window, that they must dismiss, when selecting all locations and all
     DSS units.
  
 16) Modified the patient summary report so that it includes the DSS unit
     name and DSS unit IEN.
  
 17) Modified the spreadsheet upload process so that multiple versions of
     Microsoft Excel may be used.
  
 18) Modified the spreadsheet upload process so that the inpatient filter
     is removed.  The user will no longer be asked to override inpatient
     records.
  
 19) Added an 'encounter related' header to all patient data entry screens
     for the service connected questions.
  
 20) Added the ability, during the spreadsheet upload process, to create a
     list of all patients that require service connected information to be
     entered before they can be filed.
  
 21) Create an interface that will allow for entry of additional 
     information (e.g. procedure code or provider) not currently included
     on the state home spreadsheet.
  
 22) Restore the ability to maximize event capture when launched from 
     within CPRS and then minimized.
  
 23) Corrected associated clinic scrolling in all patient data entry 
     screens. Previously, if the associated clinic was near the bottom of
     the list, you could not scroll to any other choices.
  
 24) Modified diagnosis selection on patient data entry screens so that the
     entire ICD-10 description can be seen during the selection process.
  
 25) Added new procedure reason 'CHAP COUPLES COUNSELING' to the procedure
     reasons list.
  
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ----------------------------
 1. Remedy Ticket 1300387
  
 Problem:
