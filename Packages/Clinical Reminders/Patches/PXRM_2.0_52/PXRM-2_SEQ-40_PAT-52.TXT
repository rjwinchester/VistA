Subject: HEPATITIS C UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is the most common chronic blood-borne pathogen in
 the U.S.  An estimated 3.2 million Americans are living with chronic HCV
 infection.
 In the U.S., there are approximately 17,000 new cases of HCV annually. HCV
 is acquired primarily by percutaneous exposures to blood. Approximately
 15,000 deaths from chronic liver disease per year are associated with
 HCV.  HCV diagnosis and treatment may mitigate some of the negative health
 outcomes of HCV infection.  In the VHA, the prevalence of HCV infection
 has been found to be 6.2% overall and 10.1% in Veterans born during
 1945-1965.
  
 The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends
 screening for HCV infection in persons at high risk for infection.  The
 USPSTF also recommends offering one-time screening for HCV infection to
 adults born between 1945 and 1965.
  
 RECOMMENDATIONS:
 ----------------
 It is recommended that the VA National Hepatitis C Reminder Dialog be 
 initiated and used for newly-diagnosed hepatitis C cases and that 
 information is updated periodically throughout the course of care.
  
 This patch also installs the following edits to the Veterans Choice 
 Reminder dialog:
  
 The groups and elements modified were minimal as they are used in both
 the Pre and Post Visit section.  The Groups and Elements are:
  
 Group:  VA-DG VETERANS CHOICE CLINICAL INFO
  
 Element:  VA-DG VETERANS CHOICE CLINICAL INFO TEXT
  
 Group:  VA-DG VETERANS CHOICE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
  
 Element:  VA-DG VETERANS CHOICE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
  
 The modifications are:
  
      - Remove the suppression of the check boxes on the Groups.
      - Remove Show on the Groups (hide the elements in the Groups).
      - Moved the display only Clinical Information instruction from the
        Group to the Element.
      - Added "\\" to the Clinical Info element to modify indent.
