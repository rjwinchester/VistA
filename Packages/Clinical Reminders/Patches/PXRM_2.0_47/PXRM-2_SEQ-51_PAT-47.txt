============

 General Overview:
 =================
 This patch is the follow-up to PXRM*2*26.  It removes the options,
 protocols, routines, and taxonomy fields made obsolete by PXRM*2*26,
 adds the taxonomy editor actions that could not be completed for the
 release of PXRM*2*26, and fixes some bugs.
 
 For detailed information and installation instructions, please see the
 Clinical Reminders Patch 47 Installation Guide. Instructions on how to
 obtain a copy can be found below.
 
 PXRM*2.0*47 and GMTS*2.7*113 are distributed in a multi-package build
 named: CLINICAL REMINDERS ICD-10 FOLLOWUP 1.0. Because this is a
 multi-package build, it can only be distributed as a host file; no
 builds are included in the patch messages. The name of the host file is:
 CR_ICD-10_FOLLOWUP.KID; it can be obtained from one of the anonymous ftp
 directories.
