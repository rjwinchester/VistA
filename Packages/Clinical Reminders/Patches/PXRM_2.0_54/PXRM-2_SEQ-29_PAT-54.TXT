Description:
============

 VA is developing policies, procedures, and resources to define our 
 response and approach to management of individuals who may have been
 exposed to Ebola Virus Disease.  The VA-EBOLA RISK TRIAGE TOOL 
 template is a product developed based on the Center for Disease
 Control and Prevention (CDC) algorithm for evaluating individuals
 who have traveled in countries with active epidemics of this disease.
 The collaboration led by Dr. Theresa Cullen in Health Informatics
 included input from the Office of Public Health, the Office of
 Primary Care, the National Director for Infectious Disease, Health 
 Solutions Management, Informatics Patient Safety, Health Information
 Management, the National Clinical Reminder Committee (NCRC), and the
 Nashville Usability Lab among others.
  
 The template was created for use by VA clinical staff that is evaluating 
 patients identified as having traveled to involved areas or as having 
 contact with a known Ebola patient.  Initial identification of 
 patients with travel or contact risks may be done through several
 different pathways.  These may include telephone hotlines, public service
 announcements, or signage at the medical center, all of which will direct
 patients to the appropriate intake location as established by the
 facility.  Patient check-in Kiosks in clinic areas will have a screening
 question about travel to affected areas.  Patients who enter a positive
 response will be immediately directed to clinic staff.  Clinic check-in
 staff may also ask the initial questions about travel or contact.
 Patients with a positive response will also immediately be directed to 
 clinical staff in compliance with locally established protocols.  The
 VA-EBOLA RISK TRIAGE TOOL is intended for use by the clinical staff that
 assesses patients referred through any of these pathways.  Additional
 clinical information about Ebola is available at the VA Ebola Outbreak
 site and the CDC Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever home page (see below).
  
 The template follows the CDC algorithm in guiding the assessment and 
 recommending appropriate follow-up and actions based on the findings and
 risk level identified.  It is intended for use throughout VA as the 
 approved template for assessing these patients.  It is sponsored by the
 Office of Public Health which will oversee use, evaluate data collected,
 and update recommendations as needed for this rapidly evolving disease.
  
  
 RECOMMENDATIONS:

 The template was created for use by VA clinical staff evaluating patients
 identified as having traveled to involved areas or as having contact with
 a known Ebola patient.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 =================
 1.  INC000001077502 - National Ebola Screen Content Dialog
  
  
 Problem:
 ------------
 The VA National Ebola Screen Content Reminder Dialog should be initiated 
 and used for patients identified as having traveled to involved areas
 or as having contact with a known Ebola patient.
  
 Resolution:
 ---------------
 This patch, PXRM*2*54, contains two routines, PXRMP54E and PXRMP54I.  
 They are init tasks that add new entries to the REMINDER EXCHANGE 
 (#811.8) file and the contents of these entries are installed during the 
 post-init.  These routines can be deleted after the install.
