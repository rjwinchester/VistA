Subject: INACTIVATE MHV REMINDERS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Per a request under the Clinical Reminder content update agreement, this
 patch will inactivate MyHealtheVet (MHV) Reminders. The post-install
 routine PXRM68P will prepend "ZZ" to the reminder NAME field (#.01), and
 set the INACTIVE FLAG (#1.6) and RESCISSION DATE (#69) fields in the
 REMINDER DEFINITION file (#811.9). As a result of updating the INACTIVE
 FLAG (#1.6) field, the INACTIVE CHANGE DATE field (#1.7) will be set due
 to a trigger.
