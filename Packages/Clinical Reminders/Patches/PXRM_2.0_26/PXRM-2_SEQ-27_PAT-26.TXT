Description:
============

 
 General Overview:
 =================
 This patch is part of the Computerized Patient Record System CPRSv30
 project. This project will modify the Computerized Patient Record 
 System, Text Integration Utilities, Consults, Health Summary, Problem 
 List, Clinical Reminders, and Order Entry/Results Reporting domains to
 meet the requirements proposed by the Dept. of Health and Human Services 
 to replace the ICD-9 code set with the ICD-10 code set.
 
 The Clinical Reminders changes are implemented in a multi-package build that
 contains DG*5.3*862, GMPL*2.0*44, and PXRM*2.0*26. Detailed information about
 each of these builds and installation instructions can be found in the
 Installation Guide: PXRM_2_0_26_IG.PDF. This document can be obtained from one
 of the anonymous ftp directories or from the VistA Documentation Library:
 www.domain.ext/vdl.
 
 Because this is a multi-package build, it can only be distributed as a host
 file; no builds are included in the patch messages. The name of the host file
 is: CR_ICD-10_UPDATE.KID; it can be obtained from one of the anonymous ftp
 directories.
  
 On January 16, 2009, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
 released a final rule for replacing the 30-year-old ICD-9-CM code set with
 International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification
 (ICD-10-CM) and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision,
 Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) with dates of service, or date of
 discharge for inpatients, that occur on or after the industry activation date.
 The classification system consists of more than 68,000 codes, compared to
 approximately 13,000 ICD-9-CM codes. There are nearly 87,000 ICD-10-PCS codes,
 while ICD-9-CM has nearly 3,800 procedure codes. Both systems also expand the
 number of characters allotted from five and four respectively to seven
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, which
 follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no decimal
 point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. These code sets have the potential to reveal
 more about quality of care, so that data can be used in a more meaningful way
 to better understand complications, better design clinically robust algorithms,
 and better track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical decision
 making and outcomes research.

 Software & Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ================================================
 The software for this set of patches is not being distributed through the 
 National Patch Module. There is a multi-package build named CLINICAL REMINDERS
 ICD-10 UPDATE 1.0 which contains the following KIDS builds: DG*5.3*862,
 GMPL*2.0*44, and PXRM*2.0*26. The associated host file is named
 CR_ICD-10_UPDATE.KID.
  
 The preferred method for obtaining these files is to use File
 Transfer  Protocol (FTP) to download them from: 
 ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. 
 Sites may also elect to retrieve the files directly from a specific 
 server as follows:
  
 Albany          ftp.domain.ext 
 <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
 Hines           ftp.domain.ext  
 <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
 Salt Lake City  ftp.domain.ext    
 <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  
 CR_ICD-10-UPDATE.ZIP contains the following files:
  
  PXRM_2_0_26_IG.PDF
