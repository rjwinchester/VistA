Subject: MHV SECURE MESSAGING FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch PXRM*2*24, which discontinued the use of a FileMan API to copy a 
 patient list to OE/RR lists, created a problem populating the "AB" 
 index of the OE/RR LIST file (#100.21). Consequently, this affected 
 MyHealtheVet (MHV) secure messaging which depends on the "AB" index.

 Problem 1 & 2:
 ==============
 During the time period when PXRM*2*24 was being developed, sites
 reported errors when trying to copy very large reminder patient lists to
 OE/RR lists. The error was occurring in the FileMan API used to copy a
 list; it was not able to handle such large lists. Consequently, the
 routine that does the copy was changed to no longer use the FileMan API
 and the routine was included in PXRM*2*24. It came to light that this
 caused a problem populating the "AB" index of the OE/RR LIST file
 (#100.21), which in turn affected MyHealtheVet (MHV) secure messaging,
 because the OE/RR API that MHV uses to get the list of patients on an
 OE/RR team list depends on the "AB" index.
  
 Resolution 1 & 2:
 =================
 Patch PXRM*2*26, released July 24, 2014, corrects the problem of the
 "AB" index not being populated when copying a reminder patient list to
 an OE/RR team list. The post-init of this patch checks all the existing
 lists in the OE/RR LIST file (#100.21) and ensures that the "AB" index
 is populated for all of them. Therefore, any existing OE/RR team lists
 that were created after PXRM*2*24 was installed by copying from a
 reminder patient list will now work for MHV secure messaging.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed with users on the system but it is recommended
 that the installation is done during periods of low activity. It should
 take less than 2 minutes to install this patch, however the amount of time
 the post-init routine PXRMP40I will take depends on the number and size of
 the lists in OE/RR LIST file (#100.21).
  
  
 1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    options, as desired:
        Print Transport Global
        Compare Transport Global to Current System
        Verify Checksums in Transport Global
        Backup a Transport Global
  
 3. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package: PXRM*2.0*40
  
 4. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,"
    respond 'NO'.
  
 5. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? NO// respond 'NO'.
  
 6. The post-init routine PXRMP40I may be deleted once the installation has
    succesfully completed.
