Subject: LIFE SUSTAINING TREATMENT DIALOG

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch PXRM*2.0*35 releases a new reminder dialog template to the field, 
 without any changes to routines, data dictionaries, or other package 
 functions; it deals with content only.  The new reminder dialog template 
 is:  VA-LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT.
  
 This reminder dialog template will be mandated for use upon release of 
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Handbook 1004.03, "Life-Sustaining 
 Treatment Decisions:  Eliciting, Documenting and Honoring Patients' 
 Values, Goals and Preferences."  This Handbook will replace VHA Handbook 
 1004.3, "Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Protocols within the Department of 
 Veterans Affairs (VA)."  The use of this reminder dialog template, the 
 associated progress note title, and ancillary ordering processes, will 
 introduce a significant practice change for most ordering providers in 
 VHA.
  
 Facilities will be required to install and test this template within 
 normal installation timelines as established by OIT.  However, the new 
 Handbook will allow 18 months for site implementation of the policy and 
 the associated processes.  Clinical Informatics staffs are encouraged to 
 work closely with their local Life-Sustaining Treatment Advisory /
 Implementation groups to complete post-installation steps in support of
 facility deployment.
  
 The National Center for Ethics in Health Care (NCEHC) is the Program 
 Office with oversight of this template and its associated processes.  
 NCEHC will be available to help facilities meet the timelines to 
 implement the associated practice changes and begin using this template 
 with patients.
  
 This patch will only import the reminder dialog template, associated 
 health factors, and multiple CPRS template fields.  In order to make this 
 process function as required in VHA Handbook 1004.03, each site that 
 installs this template will also need to complete the listed 
 post-installation actions.
  
 Multiple installation steps will be required, and some actions will be 
 optional.  These actions should be accomplished in your VistA/CPRS test 
 account and then transitioned to your live account after successful 
 testing in accordance with your facility's deployment strategy. These 
 processes are outlined in the Installation section.

 1) I12322536FY17 - VA-LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT REMAINDER DIALOG
  
 PROBLEM 1:
 ==========
 New Reminder Dialog for Life Sustaining Treatment note template and 
 orders were needed.
  
 RESOLUTION 1:
 =============
 This patch, PXRM*2*35, distributes the new VA-LIFE SUSTAINING TREATMENT 
 reminder dialog.  Two routines are included with this patch, PXRMP35E and
 PXRMP35I.  They are init tasks that add new entries to the REMINDER 
 EXCHANGE (#811.8) file and the contents of these entries are installed 
 during the post-init.  These routines can be deleted after the install.
  
 This patch installs the following Life Sustaining Treatment reminder 
 dialog:
  
     VA-LIFE SUSTAINING TREATMENT

 Post Installation:
 ==================
 -  Build and assign a new CPRS "orders display group": "Life-Sustaining
    Treatment."
 -  Build Life-Sustaining Treatment Generic Orders, using the new order
    display group.
 -  Build and assign a Life-Sustaining Treatment order set menu.
 -  Add auto-discontinue rules to ensure that the Life-Sustaining 
    Treatment orders DO NOT auto-discontinue upon patient movement or 
    specialty change (e.g., admission, transfer, discharge, change from
    General Surgery to Neurology, etc.).
 -  Add rules to ensure that no option to "copy" these orders is offered
    when delayed orders are written.
 -  Build the CWAD progress note title, "Life-Sustaining Treatment."
    -  The local title and print name must be, "Life-Sustaining 
       Treatment."
    -  The title must be linked to the national standard title, 
       "Life-Sustaining Treatment Plan."
 -  Link the VA-LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT reminder dialog template 
    to the progress note title "Life-Sustaining Treatment."
 -  Edit the progress note title's document definition and business rules.
 -  Edit the reminder dialog to automatically launch the new individual
    generic orders or the new order set and/or local consults and comfort
    care order sets.  (Linking and launching the LST orders from the
    template is a local option and is not required.  However, the ability
    to launch the orders from the template was highly esteemed and
    encouraged as a strong practice from all of the LST demonstration/test
    sites.)
 -  Create VistA business rules and user classes to restrict the entering
    of the progress note, "Life-Sustaining Treatment" to personnel as
    defined in VHA Handbook 1004.03.
 -  Create business rules and user classes to restrict the adding of 
    addenda to this progress note by additional personnel to only 
    those persons as defined in VHA Handbook 1004.03.
