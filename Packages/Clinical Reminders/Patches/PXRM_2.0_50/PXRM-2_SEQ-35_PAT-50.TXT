Subject: ICD10 AND SNOMED CODES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is the first in a phase of patches being developed and 
 released to update national reminder taxonomies to include ICD10 and 
 SNOMED codes.
  
 On October 1, 2015, the VA will begin to use ICD-10 diagnosis codes in 
 place of ICD-9.  In preparation for this change, the national clinical
 reminder taxonomies are being reviewed and updated by the responsible
 Program Offices in VACO.  The taxonomies are also being updated to include
 SNOMED-CT codes which are currently used in VistA/CPRS on the problem
 list.  Some taxonomies are also getting updates to the ICD9 codes based on
 these detailed reviews.  And in some cases HCPCS codes, CPT codes and
 ICD10 procedure codes are being added or updated.  This first taxonomy
 patch covers the initial set of taxonomies whose review has been
 completed.  An additional patch or patches will complete the process
 for the remaining taxonomies.
  
 The process for review included a detailed review by HIMS coding staff to 
 provide possible ICD10 codes for inclusion and then subsequent review by
 SMEs designated by the responsible Program Office.  The responsible
 Program Office is listed as the sponsor in each taxonomy definition.
  
 In the process of reviewing all the national taxonomies, a large number 
 of old and outdated taxonomies were found that were originally used in
 reminders that were distributed in 1996.  Most of those old, antiquated
 reminders have already been inactivated and renamed but the taxonomies
 that were included in them had not been reviewed or updated.  
 These taxonomies are being renamed with a leading 'ZZ' and inactivated by
 this patch.  These taxonomies should not be in use at any site and there
 are no plans to support them or update them.
  
 URL updates:
 Reminder dialog VA-AAA SCREENING contained four URL's that no longer 
 worked.  Three of the URL's were within the reminder dialog as part of a 
 TIU TEMPLATE FIELD.  The other was in the reminder definition VA-AAA 
 SCREENING.  Before the patch install, the Reminder Definition contained 
 two Web Addresses.  After the patch install, there is only one Web 
 Address for the definition.  This patch updates the URL's that are 
 embedded within TIU TEMPLATE FIELD names and also updates the Web Address 
 in the Reminder Definition VA-AAA SCREENING.
  
 Health Summary Update:
 Health summary type, OB IMAGING FOR AAA, was also updated.  The 'Max Occ' 
 was set to 10 and the 'Time' was set to null.  This was for the Component 
 named SII. 
  
 NOTE: Your Selection Items in the health summary type OB IMAGING FOR 
       AAA will be removed upon patch install.  This is a limitation of the
       install. It is IMPORTANT that you know what Selection Items you have
       in that health summary BEFORE installing the patch as they will be
       removed upon install.  It is recommended that you do a printout of
       the health summary prior to installing the patch to make it easy to
       add the Selection items back to the health summary type.
