 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1.  INC000001265257 - National Taxonomy Reminder Dialog 
 2.  INC000001280666 - SNOMED Codes                      
  
 Problem:
 ---------
 This patch is the second patch being developed and released to update 
 national reminder taxonomies to include ICD10 and SNOMED codes. On 
 October 1, 2015, the VA will begin to use ICD-10 diagnosis codes in place 
 of ICD-9.  In preparation for this change, the national clinical reminder 
 taxonomies are being reviewed and updated by the responsible Program 
 Offices in VACO.  Some of the taxonomies are also being updated to 
 include SNOMED-CT codes which are currently used in VistA/CPRS on the 
 problem list.   And in some cases HCPCS codes, CPT codes and ICD10 
 procedure codes are being added or updated.  This taxonomy patch covers 
 the second set of taxonomies whose review has been completed.  
  
 The process for review included a detailed review by HIMS coding staff to 
 provide possible ICD10 codes for inclusion and then subsequent review by 
 SMEs designated by the responsible Program Office.  The responsible 
 Program Office is listed as the sponsor in each taxonomy definition.
  
 In the process of reviewing all the national taxonomies, a large number 
 of old and outdated Taxonomies were found that were originally used in 
 reminders that were distributed in 1996.  Most of those old, antiquated 
 reminders have already been inactivated and renamed but the taxonomies 
 that were included in them had not been reviewed or updated.  These 
 taxonomies are being renamed with a leading 'ZZ' and inactivated by this 
 patch.  These taxonomies should not be in use at any site and there are 
 no plans to support them or update them.
  
 Sites should run a Taxonomy Inquiry for each taxonomy being updated 
 (refer to appendix B) and either print out or save to a file for 
 comparison after patch install.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ------------
 This patch, PXRM*2.0*61, contains two routines, PXRMP61E and PXRMP61I. 
 They are init tasks that add new entries (IRAQ UPDATES & TAXONOMY UPDATES 
 INC 2) to the REMINDER EXCHANGE file (#811.8) and the contents of these 
 entries are installed during the post-init.
  
 These routines can be deleted after the install.  
  
  
 2.  INC000001280666 - SNOMED Codes
  
 Problem:
 --------
 HPS was contacted about an issue with the URL's not functioning anymore.  
 These URL's were changed and now are working correctly with the release of
 this patch.  To accomplish this, 2 reminder dialog elements were
 changed.  They are as follows:
  
   1)  VA-TEXT OIF WEB SITES
   2)  VA-TEXT OIF INTRO
  
 In the IRAQ & AFGHAN POST-DEPLOYMENT SCREEN reminder dialog, the 
 hyperlinks were no longer working.  This was corrected and the number of 
 links was reduced.
