Subject: TELEDERM REMINDER DIALOGS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 There is a shortage of dermatologists in the VA creating an access to 
 care problem.  Long wait times to see a dermatologist can result.  In
 addition, dermatology services are typically based at medical center
 facilities that may require patients to travel long distances or times to
 receive care by a dermatologist.  To address these challenges, the VA has
 initiated a Teledermatology Program.  Store and forward Teledermatology
 is a telehealth strategy in which a trained imager at a referring site
 takes digital images of the patient's skin, uploads them through a
 computer into VistA Imaging along with additional patient information on a
 consult form completed by the ordering provider.  These are then
 interpreted by a consulting dermatologist in a timeframe that is 
 understood by both parties.  The consulting Teledermatologist reviews the
 images and answers the consult, alerting the referring provider of a
 diagnosis and recommendation via CPRS.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1.  INC00000967433 - Creation of VMP patch for telederm dialog templates
  
 Problem:
 --------
 There is a shortage of dermatologists in the VA creating an access to 
 care problem.  Long wait times to see a dermatologist can result.  In
 addition, dermatology services are typically based at medical center
 facilities that may require patients to travel long distances or times 
 to receive care by a dermatologist.  To address these challenges, the VA
 has initiated a Teledermatology Program.  New reminder dialogs for
 Teledermatology note templates were needed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch, PXRM*2*41, distributes the two teledermatology reminder 
 dialogs.  Two routines are included with this patch, PXRMP41E and
 PXRMP41I. They are init tasks that add new entries to the REMINDER
 EXCHANGE (#811.8) file and the contents of these entries are installed
 during the post-init.  These routines can be deleted after the install.
  
 This patch installs the following Teledermatology reminder dialogs:
  
       VA-TELEDERMATOLOGY IMAGER NOTE
       VA-TELEDERMATOLOGY READER NOTE
  
 The reminder dialog templates are one part of the teledermatology 
 process.  For information on the complete process please refer to the
 teledermatology implementation and user manuals found on the
 teledermatology website:
