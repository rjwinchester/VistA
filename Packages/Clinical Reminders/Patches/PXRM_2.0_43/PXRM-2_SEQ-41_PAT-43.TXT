Subject: VA-MST (Military Sexual Trauma)

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch releases one updated National VHA reminder to the field, 
 without any changes to routines, data dictionaries, or other package 
 functions - "content" only.
  
 REVISIONS
 ----------
 The revised MST Clinical Reminder aims to
   (a)  Standardize the MST screening and referral process nationwide
   (b)  Facilitate Veteran comfort and disclosure at the time of 
        screening, or at a later date when services are desired
   (c)  Provide multiple opportunities for Veteran and provider education 
        regarding the definition of MST and the availability of free
        MST-related care
   (d)  Identify Veterans who request MST-related care
   (e)  Rescreen Veterans who are re-deployed or otherwise returned to 
        military service and did not previously have an MST experience
  
 DIALOGUE
 --------
 The following dialogue and functionality changes are made to the existing 
 national MST Clinical Reminder (MST CR) (VA-MST SCREENING):
  
   1.  Addition of an introduction: The introduction informs Veterans 
       that screening is conducted in order to offer free care for all 
       MST-related services.  The introduction also indicates that Veterans
       may decline the MST screen or simply respond with 'yes' or 'no'.  
       Veterans who decline the initial screen are re-screened in one year.
   2.  Revisions to MST screening questions: Minor changes to the 
       screening language of both questions to increase behavioral
       specificity and to provide examples of experiences such as coercion
       or inability to consent.  Addition of the adjectives 'repeated' and
       'threatening' to the first screening question to better reflect the
       language in Public Law 106-117, Section 115.  Revision of the
       abbreviation 'i.e.' in the first screening question to the more
       accurate abbreviation 'e.g.'
   3.  Addition of a mental health care referral question following a 
       positive response to the screening questions to assess a Veteran's
       desire for mental health services.
  
 FUNCTIONALITY:
 --------------
   1.  Addition of a link to a printable MST Factsheet for Veterans.
   2.  Addition of text that will auto-populate the progress note 
       associated with the MST CR.  Auto-populated text provides further 
       information for the provider about MST and free MST-related care.
   3.  Revision of the reminder definition to rescreen upon entry of a 
       new DD214 among Veterans who do not already have a positive screen,
       in recognition that Veterans who are re-deployed or otherwise
       returned to military service are at risk for new MST experiences.
