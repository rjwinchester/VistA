Description:
============

 This reminder dialog template is mandated for installation, but optional
 for use. While use of the reminder dialog template is optional, all sites

 and "Advance Directive No", in their advance directive notification and
 screening processes as required by the Veterans Health Administration 
 (VHA) Handbook 1004.02, "Advance Care Planning and Management of Advance
 Directives."  
 <http://vaww.domain.ext/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=2967> 
 The use of this template and the associated health factors will help sites
 comply with the advance directive notification and screening requirements
 set forth in this Handbook.

 Problem:
 --------
 The Advance Directive Reminder Dialog was created to assist sites to

 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch, PXRM*2*57, contains two routines, PXRMP57E and PXRMP57I.  
 They are init tasks that add new entries to the REMINDER EXCHANGE 
 (#811.8) file and the contents of these entries are installed during the 
 post-init.  
 These routines can be deleted after the install.
