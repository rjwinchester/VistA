 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:

 INC000001064706
  
 Problem:
 --------
 CPRS not filing ICD9 codes in Reminder Dialogs after 10/1/14. This was caused
 by the AUID cross-reference not being re-built after the most recent Lexicon
 patch. CPRS not displaying Reminder Dialog Prompts for multiple finding types.
 The root caused of these problems were addressed by Lexicon, CPRS, and
 instructions sent to all sites.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 New functionality added to help search for coding system, finding items, and
 dialog components used in Reminder Dialogs.
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 Hines
 Orlando
 Tuscaloosa
