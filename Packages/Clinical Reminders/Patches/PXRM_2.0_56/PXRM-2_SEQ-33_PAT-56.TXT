Subject: VETERANS CHOICE REMINDER DIALOG

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Public Law 9P. L.) 113-146, the Veterans Access, Choice, and 
 Accountability Act of 2014, which was enacted on August 7, 2014 and 
 amended through the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities 
 Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-175), improves the access of eligible Veterans to 
 health care through non-VA entities and providers.  The law establishes 
 the Veterans Choice Program, new documentation and reporting 
 requirements, and the Veterans Choice fund, P.L. 113-146 did not change 
 the eligibility requirements for enrollment in the VA health care system 
 and did not modify VA's existing authorities to furnish non- VA care.  On 
 November 5, 2014, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) published an 
 interim final rulemaking, AP24, that amends sections 17.108, 17.110, and 
 17.111 of Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and 
 establishes new regulations at 38 CFR 17.500 through 17.1540 to implement 
 the Choice Program.
  
 The purpose of the Veterans Choice progress note is to communicate 
 appointment information and service approved.  It may be used for care 
 coordination activities and tracking/data mining.  The Veterans Choice 
 Note would be completed by the Non-VA Medical Care Coordination staff.  
 They will document Pre and Post visit information for care coordination.  
 The Health Factors "Veterans Choice List 30 Day and VC 40 Mile have been 
 added to the template to facilitate tracking/data mining.  The note will 
 also be used for linking non-VA provider documentation scanned into VistA 
 Imaging with the CPRS/TIU note.  The progress note approach was chosen to 
 avoid a complex Veterans Choice consult order/completion process.  As 
 with the overall process, the Veterans Choice Note template has been 
 streamlined to minimize the impact on NVC staff.
  
 RECOMMENDATIONS:
 ----------------
 The Veteran's Choice Reminder Dialog template was created for use by VA 
 clinical staff to improve the access of eligible Veterans to health care.
