 Software & Documentation Retrieval Instructions
 ------------------------------------ 
 Software being released as a host file and/or documentation describing 
 the new functionality introduced by this patch are available. There is a
 multi-package build named HT TEMPLATES PROJECT 1.0 which contains the
 following KIDS builds: PXRM*2.0*19, TIU*1.0*258, and GMTS*2.7*98.  The
 associated host file is named HT_TEMPLATES_1_0.KID.
  
 Additionally, there are two TXML template files for use in CPRS GUI.  HT
 MONTLY MONITOR.TXML, and HT PROVIDER CONSULT.TXML are bundled in the
 HT_TXML_TEMPLATES.zip file.
  
 IT installers should ensure that each site for which they are installing
 receive a copy of the zip file and the Install and Setup Guide.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at the following OI Field Offices:
    
 Albany:                 domain.ext
 Hines:                  domain.ext    
 Salt Lake City:         domain.ext

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 PXRMP19I and PXRMP19B can safely be deleted from the system once
 installation is successful and all HT reminders, reminder dialogs, and
 associated templates have been verified to be complete and working as
 expected.
  
     Pre-Installation
  
 1. Disables PXRM menu options and protocols.
 2. Deletes any previous version of the associated Reminder Exchange entry
 3. At pilot program sites, converts some preexisting local HT components
    to National components.
 4. Creates stub entries in ^GMT(142 for new Health Summary Types to be 
    installed via Reminder Exchange
  
     Post-Installation

 2. Installs the associated Reminder Exchange entry.
 3. Queues a report to run and send MailMan output to the recipients 
    selected by the installer.
 4. Sets the TIU TEMPLATE REMINDER DIALOGS parameter at the System level
    for the VA-HT Reminder Dialogs
 5. Sets the ORWPCE EXCLUDE HEALTH FACTORS parameter at the System level
    for the HT Health Factor categories
  
  
 Installation Overview
 -------------------------
 A number of Clinical Reminders Exchange entries will be installed and the 
 installer may be prompted for replacement items. Because of this, the 
 build should not be queued and the site's Clinical Reminders manager 
 should be on hand during the install.
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 20 
 minutes to install.
  
 Disable and re-enable of PXRM options and protocols is handled by the pre 
 and post init routines.
