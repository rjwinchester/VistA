Subject: LUNG CANCER DIALOG

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 DESCRIPTION
 ----------
 The National Oncology Program Office seeks to provide tools to VA 
 facilities to enable providers to format essential clinical data so that 
 it is readily available for clinical care and to measure the quality of 
 care in the VA in a prospective, timely, and cost-efficient manner. Using 
 Reminder Dialogs in CPRS is one mechanism to support these goals. 
 Reminder dialogs will include information necessary for quality 
 assessment as defined by the National Quality Forum, ASCO's Quality 
 Oncology Practice Initiative, and other reliable and up-to-date sources. 
 Reminder dialogs will enable the standardization of clinical information 
 necessary for quality indicators into a discrete format and obtain key 
 elements to continuously monitor the quality of cancer care. 
 The reminder dialogs: VA-ONCOLOGY LUNG CANCER REMINDER DIALOG, 
 VA-ONCOLOGY PROSTATE CANCER REMINDER DIALOG and the VA-SYMPTOM ASSESSMENT 
 SCALE (VSAS) REMINDER DIALOG were developed and are supported by the 
 National Oncology Program Office in Specialty Care Services (part of 
 Patient Care Services). Please contact Susan Hamilton-Hill for any 
 questions/concerns at susan.hamilton-hill@domain.ext.
  
 The VA-ONCOLOGY LUNG CANCER and VA-ONCOLOGY PROSTATE CANCER Reminder
 Dialog Templates should be initiated and used for newly-diagnosed lung
 and prostate cancer cases.
 The VA-SYMPTOM ASSESSMENT SCALE (VSAS) Reminder Dialog Template should be
 used for oncology patients at their initial visit and at every return
 visit whenever vital signs and pain score are obtained.
  
 ** NOTE: There are user guides for each of the reminder dialogs that can
          be found on the Vista Documentation Library.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1.  INC000000943596 - Lung Cancer Dialog
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 It is important to develop a sustainable solution for cancer quality 
 measurement and informed clinical decision-making in the VHA. The VHA is 
 working to develop or adopt guidelines for quality care in oncology. 
 Acquiring data to assess the quality of care among patients with cancer 
 is essential. A major challenge in this area is that a large portion of 
 information available in the electronic health record is in free text 
 form, making it difficult to mine data out of text-based information.
 As a result, there is a wealth of clinical information that is not easily 
 extractable or computable. 
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Reminder dialog templates will enable us to standardize clinical 
 information necessary for quality indicators into a discrete format and 
 obtain key elements to continuously monitor the quality of cancer care in 
 VHA.  The three reminder dialogs that have been developed will help us 
 standardize this clinical information.
