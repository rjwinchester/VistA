Subject: AIRBORNE HAZARD/BURNPIT EVALUATION

  - Routine

Description:
============

 Airborne Hazard and Open Burn Pit Registry Initial Evaluation
  
 The Airborne Hazard and Burn Pit Registry Clinical Reminder Dialog 
 Template was developed by the War-Related illness and Injury Study Center 
 (WRIISC) and Office of Public Health - Post-Deployment Health.  The 
 purpose of this template is to support the provider in a focused 
 evaluation of a Veteran who requests an examination after completing the 
 Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry Self-Assessment.  The 
 template may also be useful for encounters where deployment health 
 concerns are expressed regardless of whether the Veteran is participating 
 in the registry.  The template may be completed by a primary care 
 provider, environmental health clinician, post-deployment champion, or a 
 pulmonologist.  This template is critical to improving the process and 
 documentation of clinical care, and facilitating high quality care and 
 programmatic quality improvement.
  
 Recommendations:
 ================
 It is recommended that the reminder dialog first be installed into TEST 
 account.  After installation into TEST account the CAC/HIS will need to 
 provide the appropriate stakeholder(s)s access to TEST account so the 
 dialog can be reviewed.  The stakeholders should be familiar with the 
 functionality and content of the dialog before implementing into 
 Production.
  
 This dialog should be linked to the progress note title, AIRBORNE 
 HAZARD/BURN PIT REGISTRY INITIAL EVALUATION NOTE.  The CAC/HIS will need 
 to create the note title and link it to the VHA Enterprise Standard 
 Title, PERSIAN GULF REGISTRY E & M NOTE.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1.  INC000000943599 -Airborne Hazard and Burn Pit Dialog
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The War-Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC) and Office of 
 Public Health - Post-Deployment Health have developed the Airborne Hazard 
 and Burn Pit Registry Clinical Reminder Dialog Template to be implemented.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch, PXRM*2*39, contains two routines, PXRMP39E and PXRMP39I.  
 They are init tasks that add new entries to the REMINDER EXCHANGE 
 (#811.8) file and the contents of these entries are installed during the 
 post-init.  These routines can be deleted after the install.  They 
 perform the following during installation:
  
   1.  COMPONENT INVENTORY 
   The VA-AH-BPR INITIAL EVALUATION NOTE Reminder Dialog contains:  
    1 Dialog
    3 Branching Terms
   21 TIU objects
    7 Health Factor Categories
   68 Health Factors
    2 TIU Template Fields
    1 Sponsor
  
   2.  REMINDER DIALOG NAME:  
   VA-AH-BPR INITIAL EVALUATION NOTE
  
   3.  TERMS:
   The following 3 branching reminder terms are exported with the reminder.
   These terms require local modification and mapping.
   VA-AH-BPR AUDIT C DUE (BRANCHING LOGIC)
   VA-AH-BPR PTSD SCREEN DUE (BRANCHING LOGIC)
   VA-AH-BPR DEPRESSION SCREEN DUE (BRANCHING LOGIC)
  
   4.  LOCAL ORDER DIALOGS:
   The dialog has eight elements used for ordering appropriate
   interventions through the note.  The "Additional findings" field in the
   elements will need to be mapped to the correct local order dialog (quick
   order, generic order, order set, or order menu).  Instructions are
   included below.
  
   5.  PATIENT DATA OBJECTS:
   Twenty-one TIU /health summary objects/types will install with this 
   patch; however, only twelve are new.  The NEW HEALTH SUMMARY TYPES WILL
   NEED TO BE MAPPED TO LOCAL ITEMS.
  
   6.  HEALTH FACTORS:
   There are 7 new health factors categories containing 68 new health 
   factors.  Three health factors should already exist; CURRENT SMOKER, 
   PREVIOUS SMOKER, and LIFETIME NON-SMOKER.
