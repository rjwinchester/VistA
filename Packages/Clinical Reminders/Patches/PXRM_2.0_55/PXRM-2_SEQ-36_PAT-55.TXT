Subject: PNEUMOCOCCAL IMMUNIZATION UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 In August 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
 updated recommendations for use of PCV13 to include patients age 65 and
 over.  This patch updated the existing reminders to include that new
 recommendation.  The spacing between a dose of PCV13 and PPSV23 is now
 recommended to be 6 months (8 weeks minimum but preferably 6 months).
  
 PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE-NAIVE PERSONS
 ==================================
  
 ACIP recommends that adults aged >=19 years with immunocompromising 
 conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, CSF leaks, or cochlear 
 implants, and who have not previously received PCV13 or PPSV23, should 
 receive a dose of PCV13 first, followed by a dose of PPSV23 at least 8 
 weeks later.  Subsequent doses of PPSV23 should follow current PPSV23 
 recommendations for adults at high risk.  Specifically, a second PPSV23 
 dose is recommended 5 years after the first PPSV23 dose for persons aged 
 19-64 years with functional or anatomic asplenia and for persons with 
 immunocompromising conditions.  Additionally, those who received PPSV23 
 before age 65 years for any indication should receive another dose of the 
 vaccine at age 65 years, or later if at least 5 years have elapsed since 
 their previous PPSV23 dose.
  
 PREVIOUS VACCINATION WITH PPSV23
 ================================
  
 Adults aged >=19 with immunocompromising conditions, functional or 
 anatomic asplenia, CSF leaks, or cochlear implants, who previously have 
 received >=1 doses of PPSV23 should be given a PCV13 dose >=1 year after 
 the last PPSV23 dose was received.  For those who require additional 
 doses of PPSV23, the first such dose should be given no sooner than 8 
 weeks after PCV13 and at least 5 years after the most recent dose of 
 PPSV23.
  
 This patch does the following during installation:
  
         1.  Updates the existing reminder definitions:
             VA-PNEUMOCOCCAL IMMUNIZATION PPSV23
             VA-PNEUMOCOCCAL IMMUNIZATION PCV13
             VA-OB PNEUMOCOCCAL PPSV23 INDICATIONS
             VA-OB PNEUMOCOCCAL PCV13 INDICATIONS
  
         2.  Updates the existing Reminder Dialogs:
             VA-PNEUMOCOCCAL IMMUNIZATION PPSV23 PNEUMOVAX
             VA-PNEUMOCOCCAL IMMUNIZATION PCV13 PREVNAR
  
         3.  Updates the existing Taxonomies if not already done 
             by PXRM*2.0*50:
             VA-PNEUMOC DZ RISK - HIGHEST/NOT IMMUNO COMP
             VA-PNEUMOC DZ RISK - IMMUNOCOMPROMISED
             VA-PNEUMOC DZ RISK - HIGH
             VA-PNEUMOC DZ RISK - CHEMOTHERAPY (includes drug classes 
                classes and drugs)             
  
         4.  Immunization:
             PNEUMOCOCCAL CONJUGATE PCV13 - No mnemonic is being sent out
  
 Updates made in this patch:
         PCV13 due for over 65; PPSV23 not applicable over age 65 until
         PCV13 is given and 6 months has passed unless the patient
         has a contraindication/other reason to not get  PCV13.  Text
         information for PCV13 over 65 added shown below:
  
         PCV13 'incorrect diagnosis' option now suppressed for           
         over 65 just like that option is for PPSV23.
  
         Finding 10 in PPSV23 now turns off the reminder in all cases  
         for 6 months.  Wait 6 months after PCV13 to give any dose of
         PPSV23.
  
         Drug statuses have been added to chemotherapy to include        
         any administration of drug in the past 6 months in order to make 
         MHV and PCV13/PPSV23 the same.
  
         Removed 1 M due in advance
  
         Pneumococcal indications - fixed a bug where the time periods 
         in the object were different than in the reminder - use same
         time period on object as in the reminder.

         Added text related to requiring documentation of prior vaccines 
         before recording them.
