Subject: TERATOGENIC MEDICATION REMINDER ORDER CHECK UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Teratogenic Medications Order Check Interim Solution was originally 
 released as VistA patch PXRM*2*22 in July 2012.  The interim solution is 
 intended to have regular updates for clinical content, primarily to add 
 newly approved medications with FDA Pregnancy Categories that warrant an 
 order check. This patch, PXRM*2*51 represents the second such update.  
 Included in this update are new medications, order check text changes 
 consistent with the Notification of Teratogenic Medications project, and 
 updates to the taxonomies that define a women's medical inability to 
 conceive a pregnancy including the introduction of Systematized 
 Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes to those taxonomies.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:

 1.  INC000001050528 - VA-Teratogenic Medication Order Check Update
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Teratogenic Medications Order Check Interim Solution was originally 
 released as VistA patch PXRM*2*22 in July 2012.  The interim solution is 
 intended to have regular updates for clinical content, primarily to add 
 newly approved medication with FDA Pregnancy Categories that warrant an
 order check.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch, PXRM*2*51, represents the second such update.  Two routines 
 are included with this patch, PXRMP51E and PXRMP51I. They are init tasks
 that add new entries to the REMINDER EXCHANGE (#811.8) file and the
 contents of these entries are installed during the post-init.  These
 routines can be deleted after the install.
  
 Included in this update are new medications, order check text changes 
 consistent with the Notification of Teratogenic Medications project, and 
 updates to the taxonomies that define a women's medical inability to 
 conceive a pregnancy including the introduction of SNOMED codes to those 
 taxonomies.
  
 Please refer to PXRM_2_0_51_IG.pdf for more detail concerning these
