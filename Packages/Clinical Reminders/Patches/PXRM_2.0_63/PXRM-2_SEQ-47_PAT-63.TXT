 1.  INC000001285261 - TDAP/ZOSTER/PNEUMO Update Reminder Components 
  
 Problem:
 ---------
 PXRM*2.0*63 contains three new immunization clinical reminders, dialogs, 
 and updates to the Pneumococcal reminders by the VHA National Center for
 Health Promotion and Disease Prevention.
  
    NEW -VA-TETANUS/DIPHTHERIA (TD) IMMUNIZATION - Reminder definition and 
    dialog.
      The reminder will apply to all adults aged 19 and older.  Td 
      (Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids) should be given to adults every 10
      years as booster doses after the primary series of three vaccinations
      against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis that was received during
      infancy and childhood.
      This reminder is applicable only if a prior Tdap has been 
      administered. This prevents both the Tdap reminder and this reminder
      from displaying at the same time in the patient's record.
  
    NEW - VA-TETANUS/DIPHTHERIA/PERTUSSIS (TDAP) IMMUNIZATION - Reminder 
    definition and dialog.
      Once for ages 19 and older A single dose of Tdap (Tetanus Toxoid, 
      Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis vaccine) should be
      given regardless of when the last Tetanus containing product was
      received in adults who have not previously received Tdap.  In
      addition, pregnant women should receive an additional dose during
      each pregnancy.
      **Since Tdap was NOT available before 2005 and was NOT given prior 
      to 2006, any record of Tdap prior to these dates will be ignored and
      assumed to be an incorrect entry.
  
    NEW - VA-HERPES ZOSTER (SHINGLES) IMMUNIZATION - Reminder definition
    and dialog.
      A single dose of shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 60 years 
      of age and older who do not have contraindications to the vaccine.
  
    UPDATE - VA-PNEUMOCOCCAL IMMUNIZATION PCV13 and VA-PNEUMOCOCCAL 
    IMMUNIZATION PPSV23
      Update June 2015 - ACIP changed the recommendations to increase the 
      time period from PCV13 to PPSV23 to one year for patients age 65 and
      older who are not immunocompromised.  The time period remains 2
      months for patients age <65 or for patients who are 
      immunocompromised.  The PPSV23 reminder definition has been updated
      to follow this guidance.  Both reminders, VA-PNEUMOCOCCAL 
      IMMUNIZATION PCV13 and VA-PNEUMOCOCCAL IMMUNIZATION PPSV23 had a few
      entries for found text in the reminder definition that are updated in
      this version.  The basic logic of the PCV13 reminder has not been
      changed.  There was one update to the dialog element
      VA-IM PNEUMOC VHA GUIDANCE LINKS, outlining the new guidelines.  The 
      VIS date for PPSV23 and PCV13 has been updated.
  
    UPDATE - VA-HEPATITIS C RISK ASSESSMENT
      The name of the clinical reminder VA-HEPATITIS C RISK ASSESSMENT has 
      been changed to VA-HEPATITIS C RISK SCREEN enabling more disciplines 
      to use this reminder.

 reminders, dialogs, and updates to the Pneumococcal reminders.
