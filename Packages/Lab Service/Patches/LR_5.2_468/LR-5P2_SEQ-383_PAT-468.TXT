Description:
============

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Interagency Program Office 
 (IPO) and the Department of Defense (DoD) is tasked by its charter with
 leading the Departments efforts "to implement national health data
 standards for interoperability and be responsible for establishing,
 monitoring, and approving the clinical and technical standards profile
 and processes to ensure a seamless exchange of health data." This task
 of Native Domain standardization is aligned with achieving the goals
 outlined in the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 
 requiring that the Departments' "healthcare data are computable in 
 real-time and comply with existing national data standards" and that 
 the "data are standardized as national standards continue to evolve."
  
 VA clinicians historically used non-standardized clinical terminologies
 which are inconsistent within the VA user community as well as within 
 the currently accepted data standards as established by Office of the
 National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC).
 Implementation of Native Standardization will allow a streamlined 
 method for data sharing, performing clinical decision support and 
 engaging in national data reporting and analysis.  The VA has recently 
 established a process for implementing standard terminology/terminologies 
 within individual clinical domains for the 
 exchange of data. The intent of this effort is to provide the detailed 
 groundwork necessary for industry-wide interoperability. By providing a 
 detailed analysis of the current state of the applicable domains and 
 recommendations regarding the path forward, the Native Domain 
 Standardization supports VA's efforts to remain at the forefront of 
 healthcare data exchange.
  
 The system will include the addition of new fields to the LABORATORY 
 TEST file (#60) and creation of the MASTER LABORATORY TEST file (#66.3)
 (MLTF).
  
 The local facility Laboratory Information Manager(LIM) will need to 
 associate the local tests/specimen in LABORATORY TEST file (#60)
 to Gold Names in MASTER LABORATORY TEST file (#66.3).
  
 It will be necessary to develop a national standard of Laboratory Tests 
 and map them to their respective Logical Observation Identifiers Names 
 and Codes (LOINC Code). The MASTER LABORATORY TEST file will be 
 populated under the direction of the VHA Laboratory Program Office
 prior to implementation of any of the data within these files.  The 
 objective of this process is to enable the most user friendly interface
 possible in the implementation of the native standardization along with 
 the activities required to operationalize the change within the VistA 
 environment and the associated terminology consuming applications. The 
 Laboratory LIM will match each active test/specimen entry in the
 LABORATORY TEST file (#60) to an entry in the MASTER LABORATORY
 TEST file (#66.3) (MLTF).
 This is all that is required outside the normal day-to-day operations. 
  
 When a specimen is processed the Laboratory system does a LOINC
 Code lookup. This enhancement has added logic to the lookup,
 that if the (#60) file specimen and test is identified and
 if the (#60) file test/specimen are associated to the MLTF
 (#66.3) then the MLTF LOINC Code is used.
 If the (#60) file specimen and test are not identified or if
 the (#60) file test/specimen is not associated to the MLTF,
 then the LOINC Code determining logic that is currently in place
 will be used.
  
 The impact of this enhancement will be on the LIM, who has to
 associate LABORATORY TEST (#60) test/specimens to the MLTF.
  
 When a new Test/Specimen is entered into the LABORATORY TEST file (#60)
 an email is automatically sent to the NEW TERMINOLOGY RAPID
 TURNAROUND (NTRT) team for the creation of a new entry in the MLTF.
 The results of the NTRT process will be one of three possible results.
 1) A new entry will be created in the MLTF and will be included in the 
 next file release.
 2) A match was found in the MLTF and the facility should use that entry
 for a match.
 3) There is no LOINC Code that matches this test/specimen and a
 request for a new LOINC Code has been submitted. 
 An On Demand report is available to the VHA Laboratory Program Office 
 that will allow them to monitor new Tests/Specimens creation activity. 
 The report request subject line will be 'MLTF'.
  
 ********************************************
  
 After installing this patch and after the MASTER LABORATORY TEST file
 (#66.3) is deployed to your facility there is an associated follow on
 informational patch (LR*5.2*481) that should be installed. The
 informational patch LR*5.2*481 provides instructions for turning on the
 sending of NTRT messages to the NTRT group.
  
  
 Related Patches
 ---------------
 XU*8*665, HDI*1.0*15, LR*5.2*468, LA*5.2*82, LR*5.2*481
  
  
 Until all of the patches listed in the Related Patches section are
 installed and the MASTER LABORATORY TEST file (#66.3) (MLTF) content
 has been deployed to your facility the LIM will not have the ability
 to interact with the MLTF.
  
 The MASTER LABORATORY TEST file (#66.3), distributed with the patch is
 not populated.  Therefore, the options in the LIM NDS MENU should not
 be used at this time.  In the future, the NTRT team will populate and
 deploy the MLTF file for all sites.
 Prior to the population of the MLTF file, creation of a new test in
 the LABORATORY TEST file(#60) will generate a mailman message to the
 LIM entering the new site/specimen and members of the facilities G.LMI
 mail group.  Because the functionality to forward that message on to the
 NTRT team has not yet been turned on, sites should ignore these messages.
  
 When the content of the MASTER LABORATORY TEST file (#66.3) has
 been deployed the NTRT group sends a message to the
 NTRT_NOTIFICATION-L listserv.
  
 The LIM for the facility shall subscribe to this list using the
 following web site: http://vaww.listserv.domain.ext/scripts/wa.exe. The 
 NTRT group does not own the List Serve application. The List Serve
 is a VA service. The user will need to create an account using a
 username and password that does NOT synchronize with the user's VA
 network account.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
  
 Pre Installation Actions:
 =========================
 It is recommended that the Facility perform a VistA system backup prior
 to installing the patch.
  
 It is recommended that a 'Scratch Patch'(SP) be created containing the 
 following items:
 Data Definition for the LABORATORY TEST (#60)   'No Data'
 OPTION: LRLIAISON,
 and ROUTINES: 
 LRSRVR, LRVER1, LRLNCV, LRVRPOC, and routine from patch
 LA*5.2*92 LA7VHLU5.
 This last is for consistency of usage.  It is recommended that the 
 LAB Backout Plan (further down in this document)be reviewed.
  
 It is recommended that the LIM's Name be recorded for inclusion with 
 the LMI lab group.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ==============================
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than
 5 minutes to install.  It is not necessary to disable any options.
