  1.  Defect 924890 - Canceled Lab Test problem
  
 Problem:
 -------
 A provider is concerned that when she looks under the CPRS Labs tab at a urine 
 culture that it says completed, even though it was discontinued.  When it is a
 "CH" subscripted test and it is canceled they do not show up here.  She is 
 afraid the providers might assume that it is "completed" and is a normal urine
 since nothing shows up.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routines LR7OSMZ1 & LRMIPSZ1 are modified to display 'canceled' when the
 disposition field in the accession contains 'Not Performed'.
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 Pittsburgh HCS
