Subject: MRSA ON DEATH; LRGEN; GROUP VERIFY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  The patch addresses the below 3 issues:
   
  1. Users report being unable to perform MRSA testing on deceased patients
     but they are allowed to proceed through the accessioning process 
     without an early warning that the test has been cancelled.
   
  2. General report for selected tests [LRGEN] option skips rows of results
     when the SITE/SPECIMEN prompt is answered with the default (ANY) and 
     it frequently displays/prints unnecessary headers.
   
  3. Under certain circumstances, the Group Verify (GA) option allows 
     the verification of results marked as Not Performed.

  Remedy Overview:
  ================
   
  1. INC000000500271 - MRSA Testing on Death
   
  Problem:
  --------
  When staff want to accession or enter results for MRSA tests on a patient
  that is either deceased or discharged, they should be added as an Exempt
  Orderable Item for the Death and/or Discharge event in the Delayed 
  Orders/Auto-DC Set-up function.
  
  Instead, some staff are using Accessioning tests ordered by ward order
  entry [LROE] and are allowed to progress through the accessioning session
  without an early warning that an order has been canceled.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routine LROE has been modified to provide clear, early feedback to the 
  user that a test has been cancelled and will not be accessioned.
  
  Example:
  'All tests for this order have been canceled.'
   
  Routine: LROE
   
  2. INC000000069164 - LRGEN Missing Results
    
  Problem:
  --------
  The defect occurs when using the General report for selected tests 
  [LRGEN] option and when there are more than six (6) analytes on the
  selected tests. When the SITE/SPECIMEN prompt is answered with the
  default (ANY), the application only displays the first set of headings
  and results - that is: it only properly displays the first six results
  and skips the remaining results. This typically occurs on the results for
  the last date of service. Though no results are displayed, unnecessary
  headers are displayed or printed.
   
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Multiple modifications and the addition of a function to routine LRGEN1, 
  correct the missing results and unnecessary header issues.
   
  Routine: LRGEN1
   
  3. INC000000937699 - Group Verify Ignoring NP
    
  Problem:
  --------
  When the Group verify (GA) [LRGV] is used to verify results for a
  Work Load Area that contains accessions that have tests that have been
  marked as Not Performed on a prior date, the option can erroneously 
  verify results that may have been entered for the accession.
   
  Resolution:
  -----------
  A modification to routine LRGV2 prevents the verification of any results 
  that may be associated with Not Performed test(s).
   
  Routine: LRGV2
   
      =================== Installation Instructions ===================
     The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can
     be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
   
     NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
           problems loading and/or installing this patch.
   
     1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
   
     2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
   
     3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
        select the 'Installation' menu.
   
     4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
        that all routines have the correct checksums.
      
     5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
                Print Transport Global
                Compare Transport Global to Current System
                Backup a Transport Global
   
        If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
        patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
        Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
        your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
        'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
   
     6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
        and select the package 'LR*5.2*438'.
   
        If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
        choose 'NO'.
   
        If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
   
     7. The Post Install Routine will run and automatically delete after
        install.
