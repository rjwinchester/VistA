Subject: SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT ENHANCEMENTS FOR READABILITY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch LR*5.2*464 modifies how columnar laboratory data is displayed in 
 Anatomic Pathology (AP) final reports in the Computerized Patient Record 
 System (CPRS) and VistA option: Print single report only [LRAP PRINT 
 SINGLE]. The columnar alignment of the data is now maintained when the 
 data is copied into free text fields within the AP reports and 
 Supplementary Reports.
  
 For sites with AP electronic signature inactive:
  
 The lab data is originally populated in VistA and is structured in 
 columns so that it can be easily read. In the current system, any 
 consecutive blank spaces within the lab data are automatically reduced to 
 one blank space when the data is copied into the report or supplementary 
 report, causing the lab data to no longer be aligned under the 
 appropriate column headings. This modification stops the removal of blank 
 spaces and maintains the original alignment of the lab data to make the 
 report more legible.
  
 For sites with AP electronic signature active:
  
 This patch also corrects the text wrapping error that occurs in free text 
 fields populated with columnar data when the Text Integration Utility 
 (TIU) is utilized for final reporting. This correction stops the 
 automatic wrapping and maintains the original alignment of the lab data 
 to make the reports more legible.
  
 This intake has been implemented locally at the Kansas City, Kansas VAMC. 
  
 This patch addresses the following requirement:
  
         VHBAO: NEED502503: Surgical Pathology Report Enhancement: As a 
         health care provider, I need to view the Laboratory Surgical 
         Pathology Report columns in-line, so the report is legible and 
         I can provide timely care for the patient.
