Subject: LAB TEST NOT DISPLAYED IN CPRS MOST RECENT VIEW

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 INC3919080 - Lab test is Not Displayed in Computerized Patient Record
 system (CPRS) Most Recent view.
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  1.  Defect 909917 (SN INC3919080 - Lab Test Not Displayed In CPRS Most Recent
 View)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The site describes a problem with the Most Recent view on the Labs tab in
 CPRS.  The problem occurs when there are multiple tests with the same
 specimen with the same Lab Order number. After being signed, both tests are
 displayed on the Labs tab using the Most Recent view. After accessioning in the
 Lab package, if one of the tests is marked "not performed" using the option
 Delete Test from an accession, neither test is displayed on the Labs tab
 when using the Most Recent view option. The test that was not discontinued
 should still show on this view.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine LR7OGMC (CHKNP & GETNP) determined that the complete accession was not
 performed if any comment fields in the LAB DATA (#63) file contained
 'Not Performed:'.  The comment fields are not associated with each order
 so the existence of 'Not Performed:' is not an indication that all tests
 within the lab order are Cancelled/Not Performed.  CHKNP^LR7OGMC &
 GETNP^LR7OGMC were modified to compare the number of comment fields
 containing 'Not Performed:' with the number of tests in the lab order to
 determine if all tests in the order have been Not Performed.

 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system. Installation should

        options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch LR*5.2*516
          
              a. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
                 will (allow you to view all changes that will be made when
                 this patch is installed.  It compares all components of
                 this patch routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
              b. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
                 allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that 
                 are in the transport global.
  
 4.     From the Installation Menu, select the Backup Transport Global 
        and backup the Transport Global. This option will create a backup

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
