 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1. INC000000895757 - LRCAPES CPT code issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The ES (Electronic Signature) Display List is a list of the most commonly
 used CPT (Current Procedural Terminology)/NLT (National Laboratory Test)
 codes used in Lab CPT Billing. However when using the ES Display List,
 an invalid selection can be made leading to the assignment of the wrong
 CPT code.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modify routines LRCAPES and LRCAPES1 to not allow an invalid selection
 from the ES Display List and to display a warning when such a selection is
 made.
  
 Routines: LRCAPES, LRCAPES1  
  
 2. INC000001058933 - Active CPT rejected as inactive
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A CPT code that is linked to an active WKLD CODE (#64) file is sometimes
 rejected as inactive. This happens because the routine only checks the
 first WKLD CODE that is linked to the CPT code. A CPT code is often linked
 to multiple WKLD CODEs over time, some of which are active and some are
 inactive.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modify routine LRCAPES1 to look through all WKLD CODEs that are linked to
 a CPT code to see if any of them are active.
     
 Routine: LRCAPES1
