Subject: CLINICAL REMINDERS, LAB LABEL ERROR, HDR NOT UPDATED, P-MESSAGE OPEN ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses four (4) issues:
  
 1.      Clinical Reminder programs are referencing an incorrect subfield 
         when retrieving a lab test pointer.
 2.      When printing Future Labels, a Unique Identifier (UID) for an
         unrelated order can occasionally print on the label.
 3.      In certain circumstances, lab results are not transmitted to the 
         Health Data Repository (HDR).
 4.      When the Infection Control Survey Report is run specifying 
         un-queued output to P-Message, a Cache NOT OPEN error occurs.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1.      INC000000450944 - Clinical Reminders
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Clinical Reminder programs are referencing the incorrect field, subfield 
 to retrieve the LAB TEST FILE (#60) Internal Entry Number (IEN) for a test
 result.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The patch modifies code in four (4) routines to retrieve the correct
 location of the lab test pointer.
  
 Routines: LRPX, LRPXAPI2, LRPXCHK, LRPXSXRL
  
 2.      INC000000896007 - Lab Labels
   
 Problem:
 --------
 Sites report that when printing Future Labels, a UID for an unrelated 
 order can occasionally print on a label. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The patch modifies two (2) routines to NEW the variables LRAA, LRAD, 
 LRAN and LRUID.  With this change the variables will not be populated 
 with data from previous orders.
  
 Routines: LRLABLDS, LRLABLD0
  
 3.      INC000000968796 - HDR Not Updated
   
 Problem:
 --------
 Occasionally, lab results are not being transmitted to the Health Data 
 Repository (HDR).  The defect occurs when there is a test that has been 
 merged to another accession with the same Order #.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The patch modifies code in two (2) routines:
    1.   LR7OMERG: to properly update the "ORUT" node in LAB DATA FILE 
         (#63) and update the LABORATORY ORDER ENTRY FILE (#69) with the
         merged accession information.
    2.   LRTSTOUT: to not cancel the test when it is being merged to an 
         order with the same Order # in the LABORATORY ORDER ENTRY FILE 
         (#69) and mark a rollover accession properly as merged in the
         ACCESSION FILE (#68).
  
 Routines: LR7OMERG, LRTSTOUT
   
 4.      INC000001020038 - P-Message Not Open Error
   
 Problem:
 --------
 A NOT OPEN error is generated when the Infection control survey report
 [INFECTION CONTROL SURVEY REPORT] output is directed to P-Message without 
 being queued.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The patch %ZIS variable has been modified to allow the report to print
 without error.
  
 Routine: LRMISEZ1

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can
    be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
          problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       To preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch prior to 
       installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' option 
       at this time. You may also compare the routines in your production
       account to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare a
       Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*445'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
