Subject: LRWRKINC INCOMPLETE STATUS REPORT, CPRS LAB PROGRESS NOTES, MICRO PRELIM UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses four (4) issues:
  
 1. The shipping manifest identifier is not shown on the Incomplete Status 
    List (LRWRKINC) when printing the extended display.
  
 2. The test status may not be correctly reflected on the Incomplete 
    Status List (LRWRKINC).
  
 3. Information such as report release date and time, performing 
    laboratory, and ordering provider are displaying in CPRS Laboratory
    progress notes for a patient's ordered test even though results are not
    verified for that test.
  
 4. Multiple updates to Microbiology preliminary comments sent by the 
    Laboratory Electronic Data Interchange (LEDI) host site are not stored
    by the LEDI collecting site in the patient's record if the STORE
    DUPLICATE COMMENTS (#2.2) sub-field of the PROFILE (#50) field in the
    LOAD/WORKLIST (#68.2) file is set to "YES".

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1. INC000000807835 - LRWRKINC Incomplete Status Report 
                      (Shipping Manifest field)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    If a user selects the extended display format of the Incomplete Status 
    Report (LRWRKINC), the shipping manifest identifier does not display.
    An incorrect variable is being referenced when attempting to display 
    the shipping manifest identifier.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine LRWRKINC is modified to correctly retrieve the shipping 
    manifest identifier when printing the extended display format of the
    Incomplete Status Report (LRWRKINC).
  
    Routine: LRWRKINC
  
 2. INC000001221322 - LRWRKINC Incomplete Status Report (Test Status field)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The test status always defaults to "In lab" on Incomplete Status 
    Report rather than reflecting true statuses of "Added" to a shipping 
    manifest, "Shipped" to the host site, and "Results received" from host
    site.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine LRWRKINC is modified to print the correct status of a test. 
  
    Routine: LRWRKINC
  
 3. INC000000869626 - CPRS Laboratory Progress Notes Issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Result comments for information such as report release date and 
    time, performing laboratory, and ordering provider may display
    for a test even though a result has not been verified.  The 
    information displayed pertains to a previous test on the patient for
    the same accession area and not the test being searched.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine LR7OR2 is modified to not attempt to display result comments 
    such as report release date and time, performing laboratory, and
    ordering provider if no results have been verified for the
    test.
  
    Routine: LR7OR2
  
 4. INC000001071404 - Microbiology Preliminary Comments Update Issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Multiple updates of Microbiology preliminary comments are not stored 
    at the LEDI collecting site if the STORE DUPLICATE COMMENTS (#2.2)
    sub-field of the PROFILE (#50) field in the LOAD/WORKLIST (#68.2) file
    is set to "YES" at the LEDI collecting site.  (The LEDI host site does
    send all comment updates.) The first set of preliminary comments is
    stored.  However, any subsequent preliminary comments sent by the LEDI
    host site are not stored.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine LRVRMI3 is modified to store all Microbiology preliminary 
    comments sent by a LEDI host site regardless of whether the STORE
    DUPLICATE COMMENTS (#2.2) sub-field of the PROFILE (#50) field in the
    LOAD/WORKLIST (#68.2) file is set to "YES" at the LEDI collecting 
    site.  The laboratory report will then match between the host site and 
    the collecting site in the Preliminary Comments section.
    
    Routine: LRVRMI3

    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*453'.
  
       When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'. 
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
