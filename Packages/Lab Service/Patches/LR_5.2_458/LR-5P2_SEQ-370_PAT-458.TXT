Description:
============

 The build for this patch is distributed as part of a multi-package build 
 that contains LR*5.2*458 and LA*5.2*88.  Initially developed at the 
 Kansas City VAMC, it contains functionality to enable Auto Verification
 and Auto Release of normal lab results. This new process involves
 automatic review and release of test results based on a lab-established
 set of boundaries, also referred as rules, rule sets, and algorithms.  Lab
 results that are in a "normal" range, as pre-determined by the laboratory,
 will transmit directly from the middleware to VistA lab files and on to
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) without the intermediate step of
 requiring a lab technologist to manually review and sign off on these
 normal lab results.  This process will eliminate the need for a qualified
 technologist to manually approve all "normal" results before those results
 are filed in VistA Lab files and available for clinicians to view in CPRS.
  
 Each VAMC site will determine which instruments will use this
 functionality as it can be set up on an instrument by instrument basis.
 Essentially VistA Lab instruments are set up as either being available for
 auto verification or not available for auto verification.  If an
 instrument is set up for auto verification, then a lab result passing the
 rule set will be filed by the middleware in VistA lab files and available
 in CPRS and a lab result that cannot pass the rule set will be held in the
 middleware system for review by a lab technologist.
