Subject: SET NUMBER OF LABELS IN LABORATORY TEST FILE (#60) FOR EACH FACILITY

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Input Template

Description:
============

 The NSR20140714 Set Number of Labels in File 60 for Each Facility intake
 modification allows multidivisional facilities to set the number of 
 labels required for each site on the VistA instance. This number is set
 in LABORATORY TEST File (#60). 
  
 The current Lab Package functionality provides only one option for
 setting label requirements for all sites in a multidivisional facility.
 It lacks the necessary flexibility to accommodate the requirements and
 procedures associated with printing labels for institutions that share
 the same Veterans Integrated System Technology Architecture (VistA) 
 database. This modification will be useful to multidivisional facilities
 because it enables customizing the number of labels required by
 individual institutions within a multidivisional VistA system.
  
 This modification adds the following new multiple field to the 
 LABORATORY TEST File (#60):
  
   INSTITUTION EXTRA LABELS field (#60.15)
  
 Two new sub-fields are added to the INSTITUTION EXTRA LABELS multiple:
  
   INSTITIUTION EXTRA LABELS (#.01)b "pointer to the Institution file (#4)
   NUMBER OF LABELS (#1)
  
 The following two options are being updated to allow ADPACs or LIMs 
 ()Laboratory Information Manager) to customize the number of labels
 for individual institutions for each lab test:
     Edit atomic tests   [LRDIEATOMIC]
     Edit cosmic tests   [LRDIECOSMIC]
  
 These options, LRDIECOSMIC and LRDIEATOMIC now prompt the user for
 the following two new fields:
  
     INSTITUTION EXTRA LABELS field (#60.15,.01).
     NUMBER OF LABELS subfield (#60.15,1)
  
  
 The LIM/ADPAC selects an available laboratory test name from the 
 LABORATORY TEST NAME field (#60.01) and then selects the institution
 requiring extra labels from the list of co-located institutions to 
 populate the INSTITUTION EXTRA LABELS field (#60.15,.01). After the
 laboratory test and co-located institution are selected, the number of
 additional labels needed is added to the NUMBER OF LABELS 
 subfield (#60.15,1). This field specifies the number of labels, beyond
 the default number, set for the selected lab test at the selected
 institution. 
  
 Each lab test can be configured individually for each co-located
 institution.  After a lab test is configured, the specified number
 of extra labels designated will print each time a user at the 
 configured institution accessions an order for a preconfigured lab test.
 If either the lab test, or the institution, is not configured for
 additional labels then the default number of labels will print.
 Each lab test can be configured for multiple institutions and each
 institution can define the necessary number of labels to print for
 each lab test.  The new INSTITUTION EXTRA LABELS field (#16.1) takes 
 precedence over the existing EXTRA LABELS field (#16) of the
 LABORATORY TEST FILE (#60).
  
 Important: The INSTITUTION EXTRA LABELS field (#60.15,.01) is connected
 to the national INSTITUTION File (#4). Prior to editing the fields added
 by this modification, ensure that co-located institutions are added to 
 the ACCESSION AREA field (#60,6). This multiple field includes the
 INSTITUTION field (#60.11,.01) and the ACCESSIONING AREA
 subfield (#60.11,1).  Enter the necessary institutions and an appropriate
 accessioning area for the laboratory test being edited. 
  
 Note: The new fields added to LABORATORY TEST File (#60) for this
 modification are similar in name to existing fields, specifically the 
 INSTITUTION field (#60.11,.01), and the EXTRA LABELS field (#60.16).
 Care must be exercised to ensure these fields are not confused with the 
 new fields added with this modification when edited.
  
 
 Multi-Lab Test ACCESSIONING
 ===========================
 
 When accessioning multiple lab tests, the number of Institution Extra
 Labels will be accumulated for each test.  So the number of extra labels
 printed include the following values:
 
 (1) The original default number of labels for the accessioned tests, i.e.,
 one label per accession.
 
 -and, one of the following-
 
 (2) the number of Institution Extra Labels (field 16.1) for each test if
 that number is defined for the test and the division for which the user is
 signed in.
 
  -or- 
 
 (3) the number of Extra Labels (field #16) defined for the test, if
 Institution Extra Labels is undefined.
  
 So, for the following example with UREA NITROGEN and GLUCOSE being
 accessioned together, seven (7) total labels will print.
  
     LAB TEST NAME: UREA NITROGEN
       INSTITUTION: INST XYZ
       UNIQUE ACCESSION #: NO
          EXTRA LABELS:  4
       COLLECTION SAMLE: SERUM
       ACCESSION AREA: CHEMISTRY
       INSTITUTION EXTRA LABELS: INST XYZ    # OF LABELS: null/none
         
     LAB TEST NAME: GLUCOSE
       INSTITUTION: INST XYZ
       UNIQUE ACCESSION #: NO
          EXTRA LABELS:  null/none
       COLLECTION SAMLE: SERUM
       ACCESSION AREA: CHEMISTRY
       INSTITUTION EXTRA LABELS: INST XYZ    # OF LABELS: 2
          
 So, we have (four) 4 extra labels for UREA NITROGEN test and
 (two) 2 Institution Extra Labels for Glucose test and one label will
 print for the accession (under normal conditions with no extra labels).
 This produces
 
               1 + 4 + 2  =  seven (7) total labels.
 
 
 The NSR for this intake addresses the following requirement: 
 ============================================================ 
     VHBAO: NEED493878: As an authorized user of the laboratory suite,
 I need the ability to print extra accession labels printed on label 
 stock my facility uses, so lab test results can be easily obtained
 and delays in patient care can be avoided.  This intake has been 
 implemented locally at the Kansas City, MO  VAMC.
