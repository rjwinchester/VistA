 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC000000998830 - Lab - CH - Result Entry
  
    Problem:
    --------
    If a laboratory test has a semi-colon (";") in the test name, then
    results for the test can't be entered using option "Enter/verify data
    (auto instrument)" [LRVR].
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRGP2 to parse the data pieces correctly, even if there
    is a semi-colon in the test name.
  
    Routine: LRGP2  
  
 2. INC000000921867 - Phlebotomy log does not create entry in file 69.87
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Howdy users are scanning the specimen UID (Universal Identifier)
    multiple times using option "Phlebotomy log" [LRHY PHLEBOTOMY LOG]
    leading to a situation whereby the "Track Collection" report [LRHY
    TRACK COLLECTION] is showing that the LAB ARRIVAL TIME (file 69.87,
    field #10) is earlier than the COLLECTION TIME (file 69.87, field #8).
    The COLLECTION TIME should be earlier than the LAB ARRIVAL TIME.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
     Modify routine LRHYBC1 to only allow entry of these times once.
     
     Routine: LRHYBC1
  
 3. INC000000707820 - Howdy accessioned test in error
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In Howdy, a lab test that was designated as a "test to exclude" was
    accessioned. 
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify Howdy routines LRHYA and LRHYB to make sure laboratory tests
    that are designated as "tests to exclude" in Howdy are not accessioned.
  
    Routine: LRHYA, LRHYB, LRHY0, LRHY01
  
  
     
  
    ==================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====================
  
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can
    be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
          problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
              Print Transport Global
              Compare Transport Global to Current System
              Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*446.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
