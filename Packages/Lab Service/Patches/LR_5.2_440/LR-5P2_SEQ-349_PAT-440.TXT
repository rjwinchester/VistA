Subject: PROBLEM WITH ACCESSIONING, DC'ed TESTS, AND PANELS TO PCE 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 3 issues:
  
 1. Some data in file 69 is overlaid (wiped out) during accessioning.
  
 2. A DC'ed test (discontinued) was accessioned.
  
 3. Some panel tests not going to PCE.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC000000984319 - COMBINED FROM field in file 69 lost during
                      accessioning
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Data in the COMBINED FROM field (#20) of subfile TEST (#69.03) of the
    LAB ORDER ENTRY file (#69) is lost during accessioning.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRWLST11 to retain this data during the accessioning
    process.
  
    Routine: LRWLST11  
  
 2. INC000000938850 - DC'ed test was accessioned
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Under certain conditions, an order that is discontinued in CPRS will be
    accessioned even though it has previously been discontinued.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LR7OF2 to mark all sequences of a discontinued test as
    "discontinued/cancelled", including sequences that have been merged in
    the LAB ORDER ENTRY file (#69).
     
    Routine: LR7OF2
  
 3. INC000000936915 - panel vs atomic test
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a panel test is defined without an accession area and option
    "Enter/verify data (auto instrument)" [LRVR] is used to enter results,
    the CPT codes are not getting transferred to PCE (Patient Care
    Encounter).
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRVR1 to make sure CPT codes are passed to PCE even if
    the ordered panel does not have a defined accession area.
  
    Routine: LRVR1
  
    ==================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====================
  
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
    can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
          problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*440.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
