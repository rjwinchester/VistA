 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC5168203 - Most Recent report in CPRS buttons greyed out
  
 Problem:
 --------
 After cancelling a Microbiology (MI) subscripted test, go into CPRS
 under the Most Recent report and the canceled MI subscripted test is the
 most recent result.  If you click Next, then all the buttons grey out and
 you can no longer move between the previous and next results. This only
 happens if the most recent result is a canceled MI subscripted test.  
 This occurs when there are Chem (CH) and MI tests entered for the same
 time and then both are canceled.  This was found when a test site was
 testing patch LR*5.2*520.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine LR7OGM to adjust NEWOLD variable values to reverse date 
 for valid comparison to variable IDT.  Prior to this patch the check if 
 NEWOLD was not equal to IDT would always be true.  This patch also 
 adds logic to set piece 9 of ^TMP("LR7OGX",$J,"OUTPUT",1)
 to either 1 or 2 if no chemical test is displayable when a MI & CH test 
 are at the same date/time - to accomplish this LR7OGMC was modified to
 quit out when FORMAT=4 that will return SKIP but no other data as when
 FORMAT is 1,2, or 3.

 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
