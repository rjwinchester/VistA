Subject: STORE TEST CONFIGURATION VALUES TO ENABLE VISTA EDITING OF MIDDLEWARE RESULTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch adds functionality to store Lab Test (#60) configuration data
 which doesn't come from the middleware for verified results. This will
 allow the user to edit previously auto-released results using the normal
 VistA Lab EM/EA options utilizing the configuration values used at the
 time of original verification.

 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 R10589356FY16
   
 Problem:
 --------
 Several of the Lab Test (#60) file units/ranges/etc. values which don't 
 come from the middleware weren't being stored in VistA.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The patch modifies the STORE module of LRVRAR to save Lab Test (#60) file 
 configuration data and allowing auto-released results to be edited in 
 VistA using the configuration data from the time of original verification.
