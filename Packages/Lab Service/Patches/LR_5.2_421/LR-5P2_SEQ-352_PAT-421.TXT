Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_Production_Overview_Guide_Groups_3_4.pdf) 
 posted on the Anonymous directory for installation order. 
 This is critical for proper functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the implementation date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
 systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
 which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research.
  
 The Laboratory Emerging Pathogens Initiative (EPI) application allows the 
 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to track certain emerging pathogens on
 the national level without the necessity for additional local data entry.
 It is designed to automatically provide data on emerging pathogens to 
 Veterans Affairs Headquarters (VAHQ) without additional individual data
 entry at the site level. Functionality in this application includes using
 look up capabilities to add, delete, edit, or view ICD codes for pathogen
 set-up parameters. Once parameters have been decided, an extract
 automatically searches for specific ICD codes related to certain emerging
 pathogens (e.g., Hepatitis, Legionella). The data is sent to the 
 Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) for initial processing and
 coupling with denominator data related to workload. Veterans Affairs 
 Headquarters (VAHQ) data retrieval and analysis can then be accomplished.
 Plans can be formulated on the national level for intervention strategies
 and resource needs. Results of aggregate data can also be shared with
 appropriate public health authorities for planning on the national level
 for the non-VA and private health care sectors.
  
 Patch LR*5.2*421 makes the following changes to the Emerging Pathogens 
 Initiative (EPI) application:
 - The following fields and screens have been updated to refer to "ICD"
   rather than "ICD9":
   - Laboratory Search/Extract Parameters Input screens
   - Enter/Edit Local Pathogens screens
   - Detailed Verification Report
   - Help Text
 - Within the Enter/Edit Local Pathogens and Laboratory Search/Extract
   Parameters Input screens, users are prompted to specify a code set on
   which to search prior to entering an ICD code. Based on this input, the
   system will only allow ICD-9 entry or ICD-10 entry.
 - The Pathogen Inquiry option has been modified to list both ICD-9 and
   ICD-10 codes.
 - The Generate Local Report/Spreadsheet option has been modified to 
   include both the Diagnosis Code Set Designation and the Diagnosis Code.
 - Health Level 7 (HL7) Reports that are sent to Austin Information 
   Technology Center (AITC) have been modified to include ICD-10 Codes and
   Descriptions, which are included in the DG1 Segments in this Health 
   Level 7 (HL7) format.
