 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 1. INC000001085378 - Draw time: 0
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a patient has a lab order within the Howdy lookup date range that
    includes a test that is defined in the HOWDY SITE FILE (#69.86) as an
    order label test, and also has an order for a different date in the
    date range that doesn't have an order label test included in the order,
    the "Scan patient card" option [LRHY PATIENT CARD SCAN] will result in
    the order which has the order label test being given incorrect
    draw/collection data in the LAB ORDER ENTRY FILE (#69).
  
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routines LRHYB and LRHYPH0 to handle the draw/collection times
    for order label tests properly. 
  
    Routines: LRHYB, LRHYPH0
  
 2. INC000001056020 - Processed tests showing as "active"
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a lab order has tests with multiple collection samples and one of
    the collection samples is accessioned outside of Howdy and then
    resulted, the use of Howdy to accession the remaining collection
    samples results in the changing of the collection data and status of
    the collection sample that was accessioned outside of Howdy.
     
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRHYPH0 to not try to accession collection samples that
    are already marked as "Collected".    
     
    Routine: LRHYPH0  
  
 3. I7997705FY16 - Tests accessioned from excluded locations
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a lab test is ordered in CPRS for a future date within the Howdy
    lookup range from a non-excluded location, and another test is ordered
    for the same date from an excluded location, both tests are
    accessioned.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRHYA to not accession either test in this situation,
    but to display the message "Check with clerk at the desk".
  
    Routine: LRHYA
