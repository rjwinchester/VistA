Category:

  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NDS enhancement for the LABORATORY TEST (#60) to add and include new fields
 in the LAB NTRT message.
 Change the NLT field in the LAB NTRT message to RNLT. Add a reset function
 to the LR NTRT WALK ASSOCIATE option. Add a cross-reference to the LOINC
 CODE (#.04) field in the MASTER LABORATORY TEST (#66.3) file and increase
 the length of the ALTERNATE NAME field. Rename ISAAC fields in LAB MLTF
 MANAGED ITEMS (#66.4) file and modify values in the DEFAULT SITE LAB MAIL
 GROUP (#2) and SITE LAB SERVER (#3) fields.
  
 The NTRT message was enhanced to include the following additional fields: 
 SITE NOTES (#505), 
 INTERPRETATION (#60.01,5.5), 
 TEST INACTIVE DATE (#133), 
 SPECIMEN CREATE DATE (#60.01,35),
 IN HOUSE TEST (#134), 
 POC TEST (#135), 
 SCANNED IMAGE TEST (#137), 
 PERFORMING LAB (#141), 
 ORDER CODE (#60.16,1)
  
 The addition of new fields to the LABORATORY TEST (#60) file and the LAB
 NTRT message will provide the NTRT team with better information as to how
 the LABORATORY TEST items are being used at the sites. Changing the NLT
 field to RNLT in this message will more accurately reflect that it is the
 Result NLT that is being sent.
 The new fields being added in the LABORATORY TEST File (#60) (listed below
 in the 'Files & Fields Associated' section) are being created for future
 use by the Laboratory Domain. The VHA LABORATORY Domain will work with the
 LIM's on their usage.
  
 The current procedure for the LR NTRT WALK ASSOCIATE option is to begin at
 the point in the LABORATORY TEST (#60) file that was reached the previous
 time the option was run. This risks missing any LABORATORY TEST items that
 have been added since the option was last run. Giving the LIM the option to
 reset the process and return to the beginning will allow them to make sure
 all items are properly associated with a MASTER LABORATORY TEST entry.
  
 Adding a cross-reference and an index to the LOINC CODE (#.04) field in the
 MASTER LABORATORY TEST (#66.3) file will make it possible for the LIM to
 look up entries in that file by LOINC code instead of just the test name
 when associating the MASTER LABORATORY TEST entries with LABORATE TEST
 (#60) entries in the LR NTRT WALK ASSOCIATE option.
  
 Extending the length of the LAB TEST NAME (#.01), ALTERNATE TEST NAME
 (#.02), COMPONENT (#.05), PROPERTY (#.06), TIME ASPECT (#.07), SPECIMEN
 (#.08), SCALE (#.09), and METHOD (#1) fields in the MASTER LABORATORY TEST
 (#66.3) file will allow that file to more completely store the standardized
 lab test data.
  
 The ISAAC fields, ISAAC ACTIVE (#.05), ISAAC WEB ADDRESS (#4), ISAAC PORT
 NUMBER (#5), ISAAC NTRT PATH (#6), ISAAC SCHEMA NAME (#7), AND ISAAC SCHEMA
 PATH (#8), in the LAB MLTF MANAGED ITEMS (#66.3) file will be renamed to
 replace 'ISAAC' with 'CTT TOOLING' to reflect the move from ISAAC to CTT
 Tooling.
  
 Changing the values of the DEFAULT SITE LAB MAIL GROUP (#2) and SITE LAB
 SERVER (#3) fields in the LAB MLTF MANAGED ITEMS (#66.4) file to use the net
 name address instead of site name will ensure proper delivery of the NTRT
 messages.  
   
 BLOOD BANK APPROVAL
 -------------------
  
 VISTA Laboratory Package patch LR*5.2*500 contains changes to software 
 controlled by the ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
 Changes include:

         and Protocols? NO// 
  
 8.      If prompted Delay Install (Minutes):  (0  60): 0// respond 0.
  
  
 Post-Installation Overview:
 --------------------------
 As part of the Post Install actions routine LR500PO will update file
 (#66.4) fields: .02, .05, .1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The Post Install will
 use FileMan Functions to update the cross references in file (#66.3).
   
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
  
 In the event a site determines that this patch should be backed out,
 the site should submit a CA SDM ticket with the NSD for assistance
 with the procedure.
