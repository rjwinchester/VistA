Subject: LAB PROCESSING OF VBECS WORKLOAD ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses one (1) VistA Laboratory issue related to the 
 processing of workload transactions received from VBECS (VistA Blood 
 Establishment Computer Software).  Incorrect LAB ORDER ENTRY (#69) file 
 entries are sometimes created.
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
  
 I9122091FY16 - Lab Processing of VBECS Workload Issue 
  
 Problem:
 -------
  
 Incorrect LAB ORDER ENTRY (#69) file entries are sometimes created during 
 the VistA Lab processing of VBECS workload transactions. The incorrect 
 entries could be "orphans" or entries filed on a patient other than the 
 patient for which the workload is being processed. The orphan entries 
 contain only a "PCE" level without companion test, specimen, etc. levels. 
 This issue can occur when a VBECS order is resulted and workload 
 subsequently recorded on a date that is not the date the specimen was
 specified to be collected during order entry.    
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*494 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*494 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*494 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.
  
 Resolution: 
 ----------
  
 Modify routine LRCAPBV to set the variable indicating the LAB ORDER ENTRY 
 (#69) file date for the accession correctly before calling routine
 LRCAPBV1. The "PCE" level of the LAB ORDER ENTRY (#69) file will then be
 set correctly by routine LRCAPBV1.

    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   Install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*494'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//, 
       choose 'NO'. 
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Back-out, Rollback Instructions:
 --------------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
   
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
   
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
   
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch description.
