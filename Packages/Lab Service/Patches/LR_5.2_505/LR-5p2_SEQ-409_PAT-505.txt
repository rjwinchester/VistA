Subject: NOTIFY HPS T3 Clinical DEV OF FILE 60 UNDEF IF PRESENT 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will aid in researching the following issue:
      
 When adding/editing Lab Tests in FILE 60 (LABORATORY TEST), 
 occasionally a situation happens that causes the records to lose some 
 of its data.  Once that data is lost, subsequent processing of FILE 60 
 could produce an UNDEF Error causing a job to end abruptly and not 
 complete its processing.
      
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*505 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*505 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
      
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*505 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
       
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.

 N/A
       
   Problem:
   --------
 When adding/editing Lab Tests in FILE 60 (LABORATORY TEST),
 occasionally all of the needed data is not written to the file for a lab
 test.  At this point in time, the problem cannot be recreated on 
 demand.  
              
   Resolution:
   ------------     
 This patch is being used to capture the lab test and the user editing/adding
 it and email the G.HPS T3 Clinical DEV in FORUM. This will give the 
 HPS T3 Clinical DEV developers a more timely notification of the problem 
 and then can follow up with site personnel to help determine the cause 
 of the problem.  Processing will be permitted to continue without causing 
 the UNDEF error.

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ====================
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
        
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
      
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
      
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
      
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions
