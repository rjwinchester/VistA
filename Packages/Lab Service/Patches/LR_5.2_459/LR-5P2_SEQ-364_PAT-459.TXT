 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. INC000001020989 - Issue in EN^LR7OSUM api
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The lab results search routine, LR7OR1, adds an extra second to the
    search time period. This is causing unexpected/unwanted tests to show
    up as a result of the requested search.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LR7OR1 to set the correct start/end date/times for 
    the search process. 
  
    Routine: LR7OR1  
  
 2. INC000001054113 - Lab: CH - Accession
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Quality Control (QC) labels queue up in the LRLBL array as part of the
    LOAD/WORK list building process. The LRLBL array is not cleaned up, and
    thus stays around so that if someone does some normal accessioning, the
    QC labels print along with the normal accessioning labels.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRLL4 to NEW the array LRLBL so that it will go
    away after the LOAD/WORK list build process has completed.
  
    Routine: LRLL4   
  
    ==================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====================
   The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
   1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your

   3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
      select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
      that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
              Print Transport Global
              Compare Transport Global to Current System
              Backup a Transport Global
  
      If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch
      prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global'
      option at this time. You may also compare the routines in your
      production account to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare
      a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
      and select the package 'LR*5.2*459.
  
      If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
