 ==========================================================================
  
  
 LR*5.2*476 provides the following enhancements to VistA:
  
 - Adds a new FileMan function, LRRESULT, to the FUNCTION (#.5) file. This
 function enables reporting on lab results for a specific patient, specimen
 type, and lab test, looking back over a specified number of days. This
 enhancement applies only to lab tests with verified results for patients
 currently admitted.
  
 Users must be familiar with FileMan file structure and commands to create 
 and run a report. The four input parameters required to execute the
 function must be entered in the following sequence:
   a) Patient number from the PATIENT (#2) file, entered as NUMBER
   b) Specimen type internal entry number (IEN) from the TOPOGRAPHY
      FIELD (#61) file
   c) IEN of the lab test in the LABORATORY TEST (#60) file
   d) Look-back number of days
  
 The new entry in the FUNCTION file is defined as follows:
  
 NAME: LRRESULT
   MUMPS CODE: S X=$$GETLAB^LRFRSLT(X,X1,X2,X3)
   NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS: 4
   EXPLANATION: Lab result retriever -- used with the format of 
 LRFRSLT(a,b,c,d) where a is referenced as INTERNAL(PATIENT), b is the 
 specimen file 61 IEN, c is the lab file 60 test IEN, and d is the number
 of days to search back
  
 LRRESULT and the new routine LRFRSLT have been created to support this 
 enhancement. Following is an abbreviated example of how to run the report 
 for a verified lab test.

 - Modifies data in the EXECUTE CODE (#62.07) file to enable batch entry 
 of preliminary comments for designated accession numbers. When a 
 microbiology technologist needs to enter preliminary comments for 
 accessions with negative cultures in VistA, this enhancement enables the 
 technologist to enter the same comment for multiple accession numbers. 
 For example, a site might process hundreds of urine cultures daily. 
 Currently, the technologist must enter "No growth after 24 hours" as a 
 preliminary result individually for each applicable accession. With this 
 modification, technologists can enter the same preliminary result for all 
 applicable accessions at once, thereby reducing the time and effort 
 required to make preliminary results available for clinical use.  
  
 To accomplish this, the modification adds data to the BACTERIOLOGY, 
 MYCOLOGY, and TB BACTERIOLOGY records in the EXECUTE CODE file, EXECUTE 
 CODE (#1) field. The data is taken from sub-fields located in the LAB 
 DATA (#63) file, MICROBIOLOGY (#63.05) sub-file, MICROBIOLOGY (#5) field. 
 The sub-fields are:
  
 PRELIMINARY BACT COMMENT (#1) sub-field for Bacteriology accessions
 PRELIMINARY MYCOLOGY COMMENT (#20.5) sub-field for Mycology accessions
 PRELIMINARY TB COMMENT (#26.5) sub-field for Mycobacteriology accessions
  
 Using the Results Entry (Batch) [LRMISTUF] option, the technologist can
 select a sub-field and enter a preliminary comment for multiple accession 
 numbers. Once the comment is entered, routine LRMISTF updates the 
 corresponding BACTERIOLOGY, MYCOLOGY, or TB BACTERIOLOGY data record in 
 the EXECUTE CODE file. 
  
 The existing BACTERIOLOGY, MYCOLOGY, and TB BACTERIOLOGY data records in 
 the EXECUTE CODE file must be modified to accept new preliminary comment 
 entries. This modification is performed at the end of patch installation 
 by the post-installation routine LR52P476. The installation history for 
 the patch will capture the before and after data for the EXECUTE CODE 
 field so that it can be referenced for comparison if needed. The history 
 of the patch installation can be reviewed with the Install File Print 
 [XPD PRINT INSTALL FILE] option under the KIDS UTILITIES submenu. Routine 
 LR52P476 is deleted automatically at the end of the patch installation.

 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of this patch, it is not recommended for 
 backout. However, in the event that a site decides to back out this 
 patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit 
 a CA Technologies Service Desk Manager (CA SDM) ticket. The development 
 team will then assist with the backout process.
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the LR routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the LR routines have been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain 
 the designation of patch LR*5.2*476 on line 2 in the patch list section.
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out; it does not confirm that other patch component changes 
 have been backed out.
