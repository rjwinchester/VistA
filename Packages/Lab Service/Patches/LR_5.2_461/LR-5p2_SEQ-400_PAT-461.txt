Description:
============

 This patch addresses two (2) issues:
  
 1. Accessions which have been cancelled (i.e. marked as "not performed" or
    which have been merged to other accessions) may be resulted
    nevertheless.
  
 2. Anatomic Pathology labels do not print while using the option 
    REFERRAL PATIENT MULTI-PURPOSE option for accessioning orders.

 Ticket Overview:
 ===============
 1. I9835956FY16 - Lab Accession Not Performed /Merged Issue
    
    Problem:
    --------
    It is possible to have results entered and verified on a cancelled UID 
    (universal identifier). Furthermore, two different results for the same
    test on the same specimen may be visible in CPRS.  This can occur if a
    result is entered on a cancelled UID which was previously merged to
    another UID, and if a different result is entered on the merged UID.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify result entry and verification routines to not allow results to
    be entered on an accession which has a cancelled status.  The cancelled
    status may be due to the accession being marked as "not performed", or
    it may have merged to another accession.
    
    Routines: LRVER1, LRVER3, LRSTUF2, LRMIEDZ4
  
 2. I9841929FY16 - Anatomic Pathology Label printing issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Labels do not print for Anatomic Pathology accessions while executing
    the option Referral Patient Multi-purpose Accession [REFERRAL PATIENT
    MULTI-PURPOSE] to accession Laboratory Electronic Data Interchange
    (LEDI) orders at a host site.
  
    Resolution:
    ------------
    Modify routine LRWLST11 to not restrict Anatomic Pathology accessions 
    from label printing functionality.
  
    Routine: LRWLST11

 3. Select Installation Option:
    ---------------------------
    NOTE:  The following are OPTIONAL - (When prompted for the INSTALL
           NAME, enter LR*5.2*461):

        you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
        transport global.
    b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
        the components of the KIDS build.
    c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
        is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
        (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions
