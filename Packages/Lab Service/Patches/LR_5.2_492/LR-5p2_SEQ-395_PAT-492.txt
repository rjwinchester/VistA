Subject: LAB PHLEBOTOMY COLLECTION LIST ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses three (3) VistA Laboratory issues related to 
 phlebotomy collection list logic:
  
 1.  Test orders that roll over from one collection list to another may 
 appear to be ordered twice in CPRS even though they are only ordered once.
  
 2.  Merged orders created by collection list generation sometimes do not 
 have correct CPRS start date/times as well as other discrepancies.
  
 3.  The LAB ORDER ENTRY (#69) file LAB ARRIVAL DATE/TIME (#20) field is 
 erroneously set during collection list generation.

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
  
 1.  I9678021FY16: Collection List Rollover Issue 
  
     Problem:
     -------
  
     When an order is added to the collection list, rolled over to the next
     collection list, and combined/merged with an order on the second
     collection list, the orders may display multiple times on the
     collection list.  The sites have reported that "sometimes when using
     option LRPHITEM, the merged tests are not fully accessioned, and thus
     cannot be found when the auto instrument queries for orders."   The
     root cause of this situation is that merged tests may have multiple
     entries in the LAB ORDER ENTRY (#69) file, but only one entry per test
     is accessioned. Also, the accession in the ACCESSION (#68) file may 
     not match the corresponding accession field in the LAB ORDER ENTRY
     (#69) file.
     
     Resolution:
     ----------
  
     Modify routine LRTSTSET so that during the collection list merge 
     process, the LAB ORDER ENTRY (#69) file will only have one active
     entry per test ordered, and thus only one accession per test ordered.
     Also, the accession in the ACCESSION (#68) file will match the 
     corresponding accession field in the LAB ORDER ENTRY (#69) file.
     
     Routine: LRTSTSET
  
  
  2. I9678978FY16: Merged Order Issues
  
     Problem:
     -------
  
     Orders that are merged during collection list generation may not
     display the correct value for the CPRS Start Date/Time.  Sites have
     also reported that a message of "Not accepted" is displayed when
     trying to receive some orders.
  
     Resolution:
     ----------
  
     Modify routines LRPHSET2 and LRTSTSET to set the LAB ORDER ENTRY (#69)
     file and the ORDERS (#100) file correctly when orders are merged
     during collection list generation.
  
     Routines: LRPHSET2 and LRTSTSET
  
 3.  I15331849FY17: Lab Arrival Date/Time Issue
  
     Problem:
     -------
  
     The LAB ORDER ENTRY (#69) file LAB ARRIVAL DATE/TIME (#20) field is 
     set after Phlebotomy List is generated. The LAB ARRIVAL DATE/TIME 
 (#20) field should not be set until orders are received into the lab using
     an option such as LRPHITEM.
  
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
  
     Modify routine LRPHSET1 to not set the LAB ARRIVAL DATE/TIME (#20) 
     field during phlebotomy collection list generation.
  
     Routine: LRPHSET1
  
    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   Install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*492'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//, 
       choose 'NO'. 
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
