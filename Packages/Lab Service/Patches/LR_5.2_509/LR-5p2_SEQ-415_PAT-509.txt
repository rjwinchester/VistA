Subject: EPI EXTRACT W23 WARNING MESSAGES; AP ISSUES RELATED TO CPRS ORDER ENTRY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses four (4) issues:
  
 1.  Emerging Pathogen Initiative (EPI) data is collected in VistA and 
     forwarded to the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) for
     national roll-up monthly.  Part of the collected data has to do with
     Clinical Reminders related to Hepatitis C.  The Clinical Reminder data
     is formatted into the DSP segment of a HL7 record for delivery to the
     AITC.  The data is currently being formatted improperly.
  
 2.  When USING AP Log-in, anat path [option LRAPLG], an <UNDEFINED> error
     occurs in the NEXT subroutine of routine LRAPKOE when logging in a 
     case for a deceased veteran ordered in CPRS.
  
 3.  In AP Log-in, anat path [option LRAPLG], the PATHOLOGIST prompt is a 
     required entry.  The pathologist who will read the case is usually 
     not known at the time the case is logged into the laboratory.  The 
     process should be modified to make entry of PATHOLOGIST optional.
  
 4.  The routine (LRAPKOE) that processes Anatomic Pathology orders entered
     in CPRS needs to be modified to call VistA Imaging to add the case to
     the MAG PATH CASELIST file (#2005.42) to support Telepathology and to
     generate the HL7 message that is sent to digital pathology systems.
  
 Associated NSR(s):
 ==================
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 20090511 - VistA Imaging Enhancements: Store and Forward Telehealth and 
 Telepathology
  
 The previous patch LR*5.2*433 made changes to the legacy Anatomic 
 Pathology case login routines to support this NSR.  This patch makes the
 same changes for the CPRS Anatomic Pathology ordered case login routines.

 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*509 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. I18968586FY18 - EPI Extract W23 Warning Messages
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Clinical Reminders code called by the EPI search option properly 
 returns the reminder text but not the number (1 - 7) sometimes referred
 to as the Resolve Term (ALTTRM).  As a result, the EPI code sets the 
 number equal to "00" in the HL7 DSP segment to be sent to Austin.  This
 works for two (2) of the reminders (5 and 6) but not the others.  The 
 AITC performs validations on the data that expect that if the value in
 the Resolve Term is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 7; then the lab result data value must
 be null.  If it is 0, 5 or 6; the lab result value must not be null.
  
 When there is an inconsistency between the value of the Resolve Term and
 whether the result field is null, a W23 warning message is generated.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Per the business owners, the data is no longer used by EPI and the HIV, 
 Hepatitis, and Related Conditions (HHRC) program is not using it.  
 Consequently, there is no point for the LREPI routine to continue to call
 the Clinical Reminders API and send the data to Austin. As a result, the
 routine LREPI is modified to not call the routine (^PXRMXX) that extracts
 the Clinical Reminders. That will eliminate the W23 warnings.
  
 Routines: LREPI
  
 2. RTC WI 756192 - UNDEF Error when Logging Deceased Veteran
   
 Problem:
 --------
 An <UNDEFINED> error occurs in the NEXT subroutine in ^LRAPKOE when 
 performing AP Log-In in VistA for an Anatomic study ordered in CPRS v32
 for a deceased veteran.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine LRAPKOE in subroutine NEXT to assure that variable LRVIDO
 is defined.
  
 Routines: LRAPKOE
  
 3. RTC WI 756196 - PATHOLOGIST Prompt Should be Optional
   
 Problem:
 --------
 When an Anatomic Pathology order is entered via CPRS V32 Order and logged
 in in VistA, entry of a pathologist is required.  However, the pathologist
 who will ultimately read the case is usually not known at the time that
 the case is logged into the laboratory.  The log in pathway for V32 orders
 should be consistent with the legacy roll and scroll anatomic pathology 
 login process which has the PATHOLOGIST prompt as optional.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine LRAPKOE is modified to change the PATHOLOGIST prompt from 
 "required" to "optional".
  
 Routines: LRPAKOE
  
 4. RTC WI 756202 - LRAPKOE Modification for VistA Imaging
   
 Problem:
 --------
 CPRS v32 provided a new Anatomic Pathology Order Entry capability.  
 LRAPKOE is the new routine that takes an order entered via CPRS and logs
 it into the legacy anatomic pathology application (LRAP*).  LRAPKOE was
 created in patch LR*5.2*462 and updated in patch LR*5.2*479 and again in
 LR*5.2*483.  The current programming does not call VistA Imaging to add a
 case to the MAG PATH CASELIST file (#2005.42).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 LRAPKOE is modified to call VistA Imaging to add the case study to the
 MAG PATH CASELIST file (#2005.42) to support a Telepathology Worklist 
 and to generate the HL7 message that is sent to digital pathology systems.

 Patch Installation:
 ===================
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system. The 
 install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
 problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option to load the KIDS patch
    into a Transport Global on your system.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System Menu (KIDS), select
    the Installation Menu.
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select the Backup a Transport Global 
    option and when prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch
    LR*5.2*509. This option will create a backup message of any routines
    exported with this patch. It will not backup any other changes such as
    DDs or templates.
     
 5. From the Installation Menu, you may elect to use the following options.
    When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch LR*5.2*509.
  
     a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
     
     b. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to print only 
        a summary of the patch, to print a summary of the patch and the
        routines in the transport global, or to print only the routines in
        the transport global.
  
     c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed. (It compares all components of this patch's routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
 6. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    enter the patch LR*5.2*509.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//', 
    respond 'NO'.
  
 8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? NO//', respond 'NO'.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility Chief Information 
 Officer may make the decision to back-out the patch.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed-up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The PackMan
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum matches
 the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
