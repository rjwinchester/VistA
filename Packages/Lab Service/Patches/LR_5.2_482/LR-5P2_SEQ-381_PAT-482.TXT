 clinicians to provide required patient-specific, procedure-specific, and 
 specimen-specific information to facilitate specimen processing by 
 pathologists. This mechanism must be in place for use by the specimen 
 labeling application in order to generate a primary specimen label that 
 positively identifies the specimen and accurately associates it with the
