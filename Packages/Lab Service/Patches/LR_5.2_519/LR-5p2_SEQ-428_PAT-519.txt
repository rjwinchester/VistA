Subject: LAB PANEL DISPLAY, DATA NAME CORRUPTION, GROUP VERIFY PRINTING ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses three (3) issues:
  
 1. When a lab panel (cosmic) test is set up so the atomic tests in the
    panel split to separate accession areas (e.g.: one Chemistry and one
    Toxicology), results of the ordered panel test do not display all of
    the results of the atomic tests in the panel when viewed in CPRS from
    the Orders tab or from the Cover Sheet.  
  
 2. Corruption can occur in the data dictionary - ^DD(63.04 - if one or
    more users are adding or editing data names for Laboratory tests.
  
 3. A VistA software error might be generated during execution of option 
    "Group verify (EA, EL, EW)" if results are being printed.
  
  
 Blood Bank Review:
 ==================
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*519 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*519 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*519 have no adverse effect on 
 Blood Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
  
 1. INC2298578 - Lab Panel Displays Incorrectly in CPRS
  
    Problem:
    --------
  
    When there are two (2) accessions created during the accessioning 
    process, the date.time value used to store data about the tests in the
    LAB DATA file (#63) can be slightly different (e.g.: 6819595.864069 and
    6819595.86407). Only one (1) date.time value is stored in the ORDER
    file (#100).  Invariably, a $ORDER based on those parameters will
    exceed the end date (or be beyond the start date) after the first pass
    and then it will QUIT.  Consequently, only one (1) set of results will
    be returned.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
  
    The routines ^LR7OR1 and ^LR7OR2 are modified to search for results in 
    the LAB DATA FILE (#63) for date.time entries that contain results for 
    the proper order number.
  
    Routines: LR7OR1, LR7OR2
  
 2. INC4830471 - VistA Data Collision
  
    Problem:
    -------
  
    An issue might occur if two users are defining or modifying a
    Laboratory test data name at the same time using the VistA options "Add
    a new data name", "Modify an existing data name" or FileMan option
    "MODIFY FILE ATTRIBUTES". The issue is that two internal entry numbers
    (IENs) might be defined for identical data names. It is also possible
    that an IEN might have two name entries. However, this issue does not
    cause any harm because an IEN might have both a name and a synonym on
    file.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
  
    (1) Modify options "Add a new data name" and "Modify an existing data 
        name" so that an internal entry number (IEN) is locked which 
        prevents more than one user from defining information for the same
        IEN at the same time.
  
    (2) Add a documentation update to the Laboratory Planning and 
        Implementation Guide (PIG) that FileMan should not be used to add 
        or edit data names since FileMan does not contain locking logic.
  
    (3) Add logic to the tasked option "LRTASK NIGHTY" (sic) to check for 
        the "one name / two IENs" issue in case users continue to use
        FileMan for adding and editing.  Any instances of the issue found
        will be detailed in a MailMan message to users already specified
        for receipt of messages generated by the option "LRTASK NIGHTY".
  
    (4) Post-install routine LR519 will search for the "one name / two 
        IENs" issue. A MailMan message will be sent to the LMI group with
        details of instances found. NOTE: This message is not delivered 
        NEW. The LIM must actively look for the message in the IN basket.  
        It is important to find and read this message.

    Documentation Updates
    ---------------------
  
    The Laboratory Planning and Implementation Guide (PIG) has been 
    updated in the section titled: "Add a new data name".
  
    The Laboratory Technical Manual has been updated in the section titled:
    "New Data Names" and in the section titled "Routine Descriptions".
  
    Both manuals are located in the VA Document Library (VDL) at:
    https://www.domain.ext/vdl/application.asp?appid=71
  
 3. INC3357612 - Group Verify Printing Issue
  
    Problem:
    -------
  
    A "READ" error might occur during execution of the VistA option "Group 
    verify (EA, EL, EW)" if an accession contains more than ten lines of
    comments to be processed.  The error is caused by a variable not being
    set which indicates the option has been queued to print results rather
    than displaying results to the user's screen.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
  
    Add logic to the option "Group verify (EA,EL, EW)" which will determine
    whether results have been queued to a printer.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can be
 installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
 problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
 1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This option
    will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
 2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your system.
    You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
 3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS), select
    the 'Installation' menu.
  
 4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
    all routines have the correct checksums.
     
 5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
    options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
    To preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch prior to
    installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' option at
    this time. You may also compare the routines in your production account
    to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare a Transport Global
    to Current System' option.
  
 6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' Menu and
    select the package 'LR*5.2*519'.
  
    If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//,
    choose 'NO'.
  
    If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
  
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
