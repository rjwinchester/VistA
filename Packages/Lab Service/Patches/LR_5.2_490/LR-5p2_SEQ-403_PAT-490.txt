Subject: LRORDR DEFINED, MISSING UN-RELEASE PROMPT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses two (2) issues:
  
 1.   When a user goes to the Multipurpose accessioning option [LRQUICK] 
      in the Accessioning menu option [LR IN], the variable LRORDR may 
      still be set and causes the accessioning routine to erroneously 
      assume that specimen collection will be by Ward Collect.
  
 2.   When Anatomic Pathology Electronic Signatures are turned off and 
      the Verify/release reports, anat path option [LRAPR] is selected to
      unrelease a verified provisional report, the prompt to "Unrelease
      Report" is not displayed.

 BLOOD BANK IMPACT:
 ==================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*490 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*490 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*490 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.
  
  
 CA SDM Overview:
 ================
 1.    R14025160FY17 - LRORDR Defined
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When going into the Log-in menu, anat path option [LRAPLG] from the 
 Log-in menu, anat path option [LRAPL] in the Anatomic Pathology menu 
 option [LRAP] of the Laboratory DHCP Menu [LRMENU], variable LRORDR gets
 set to "WC" (Ward Collect) and is not cleaned up when exiting the option.
 If a user goes to the Multipurpose accessioning option [LRQUICK] in the 
 Accessioning menu option [LR IN] right after using the Log-in menu, anat
 path option [LRAPL], the variable LRORDR is still set and causes the
 accessioning routine to erroneously assume that specimen collection will
 be by Ward Collection.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine ^LRAPLG is modified to NEW the variable LRORDR.
  
 2.    I12008486FY17 - Missing Unrelease Prompt
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user has an autopsy report that had a Provisional report entered
 and verified and is ready to verify the final report, the provisional 
 report needs to be unreleased using Verify/release reports, anat path
 option [LRAPR].  However, when Electronic Signatures are turned off, and
 the LRAPR option is selected, and a patient is entered, the prompt to
 "Unrelease Report" is not displayed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine ^LRAPR is modified to present the prompt.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can be
 installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
 1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
    option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
 2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
    system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
 3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
    select the 'Installation' menu.
  
 4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
    that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
 5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
    following options:
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
  
    To preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch prior
    to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' 
    option at this time. You may also compare the routines in your 
    production account to the routines in the patch by using the 
    'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
 6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' 
    Menu and select the package 'LR*5.2*490'.
  
    When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
    choose 'NO'.
  
    When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
    And Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
