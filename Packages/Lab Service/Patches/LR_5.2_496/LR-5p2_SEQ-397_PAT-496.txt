    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   Install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*496'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//, 
       choose 'NO'. 
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
