 #20140511 
 The Anatomic Pathology (AP) laboratory service needs a mechanism for 
 clinicians to provide required patient-specific, procedure-specific, and 
 specimen-specific information to facilitate specimen processing by 
 pathologists. This mechanism must be in place for use by the specimen 
 labeling application in order to generate a primary specimen label that 
 positively identifies the specimen and accurately associates it with the 
 patient.

 Patch Installation:
   
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ------------------------------------------
 The environment check will ensure that the following ORDERABLE ITEMS and 
 TOPOGRAPHY entries are an exact name match before patch LR*5.2*469 will 
 be allowed to install. This matching is critical due to the dependency of
 the configuration in LR AP DIALOG CONFIG file by ORDERABLE ITEM and 
 TOPOGRAPHY.
  
 Orderable Item search Criteria:
      First check is for an exact name match
           If multiples found the check will fail
           If one or more match the name but none have a display group of
             anatomic pathology the check will fail
           If there is one exact name match with a display group of 
             Anatomic Pathology the check will be successful
  
 Specimen search Criteria:
      First check to see if SCT code has been assigned to any specimen
           If no association is found the check will fail
      Find all specimen entries in the environment check that have an
        SCT code assigned
           Find all specimens with an exact name match
           If SCT code is found for only one specimen check is successful
           If an exact name matches the SCT code the check is successful
           If multiple specimen with matching SCT code and matching names
             the check will fail

 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install
  
 1.   The Laboratory ADPAC will need to create thirteen new lab tests to 
       support the CPRS AP DIALOG functionality. These tests must be set up
      with a collection sample of AP SPECIMEN.
  
      If the COLLECTION SAMPLE file does not have an AP SPECIMEN entry
     refer to Section 2.2 of the following document:
           LEDI IV Installation Guide (Lab_Ledi_IV_Install_Guide.pd)
  
  
 2.   Add thirteen new tests to the LABORATORY TEST file. Below are
      examples of what the AP tests should look like in the LABORATORY TEST
      File (#60) once the entries have been created. 
  
 NOTE: Use the appropriate Institution(s), accession areas and workload
 entries applicable for your facility.
  
 WARNING: Make sure there are no other entries in the LABORATORY TEST file 
 that have the same name or synonym even though the subscript is
 different. 
  
 For example: If there is an existing Bone Marrow with Subscript of 
 'Cytology' then you may rename the test to 'Bone Marrow (Cytology)'.
 In addition if there is a synonym of 'Bone Marrow' then you may rename it
 to 'Bone Marrow (CY)'.
  
 Set all tests up and set the TYPE field to NEITHER. When CPRS v32 is
 available, you can set the TYPE field to BOTH.
  
 Workload code configuration should be done in compliance with your 
 current Laboratory practices.
  
 The PRINT NAME is not important and can be whatever you wish it to be.
  
 The ACCESSION AREA should be whatever is in use at your facility as long 
 as it is appropriate for the subscript of the test.
