Sept 30, 2016 - V9 - fixes defect #371947 by changing the values for the 
"BLD",9537,1,2,0)
HIDE FROM DESCRIPTION field (#.02) of the SPECIMEN multiple (#3) of the 
"BLD",9537,1,3,0)
LR AP DIALOG CONFIG file (#69.73) has been deleted in which the previous 
"BLD",9537,1,4,0)
values were YES

"BLD",9537,1,6,0)
Defect #371947 - During Sprint 12 Review demo the SMEs asked if the
"BLD",9537,1,7,0)
specimen could automatically populate in the Specimen Description [field]
"BLD",9537,1,8,0)
as that would be important.  The specimen is usually a part of the
"BLD",9537,1,9,0)
description.  Stuti replied that a decision was made to remove the
"BLD",9537,1,10,0)
specimen from the Specimen Description; she also pointed out that there is
"BLD",9537,1,11,0)
a character limitation in Specimen Description.  Dev state that there is a
"BLD",9537,1,12,0)
"switch" in the configuration to turn it on.

     Each specimen of each orderable item within LR AP DIALOG CONFIG has
"BLD",9537,1,17,0)
     had the field HIDE FROM DESCRIPTION nullified so that the GUI will
"BLD",9537,1,18,0)
     move the specimen name into the specimen description when building
"BLD",9537,1,19,0)

The Anatomic Pathology (AP) laboratory service needs a mechanism for 
"BLD",9537,1,138,0)
clinicians to provide required patient-specific, procedure-specific, and 
"BLD",9537,1,139,0)
specimen-specific information to facilitate specimen processing by 
"BLD",9537,1,140,0)
pathologists. This mechanism must be in place for use by the specimen 
"BLD",9537,1,141,0)
labeling application in order to generate a primary specimen label that 
"BLD",9537,1,142,0)
positively identifies the specimen and accurately associates it with the

patient.

Pre-Installation Instructions:
"BLD",9537,1,321,0)
-------------------------------------
"BLD",9537,1,322,0)
This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
"BLD",9537,1,323,0)
recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
"BLD",9537,1,324,0)
potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
"BLD",9537,1,325,0)
minutes 
"BLD",9537,1,326,0)
to install
"BLD",9537,1,327,0)
 
"BLD",9537,1,328,0)
1.   The Laboratory ADPAC will need to create thirteen new lab tests to 
"BLD",9537,1,329,0)
      support the CPRS AP DIALOG functionality. These tests must be set up
"BLD",9537,1,330,0)
     with a collection sample of AP SPECIMEN.
"BLD",9537,1,331,0)
 
"BLD",9537,1,332,0)
     If the COLLECTION SAMPLE file does not have an AP SPECIMEN entry
"BLD",9537,1,333,0)
    refer to Section 2.2 of the following document:
"BLD",9537,1,334,0)
          LEDI IV Installation Guide (Lab_Ledi_IV_Install_Guide.pd)
"BLD",9537,1,335,0)
 
"BLD",9537,1,336,0)
 
"BLD",9537,1,337,0)
2.   Add thirteen new tests to the LABORATORY TEST file. Below are
"BLD",9537,1,338,0)
     examples of what the AP tests should look like in the LABORATORY TEST
"BLD",9537,1,339,0)
     File (#60) once the entries have been created. 
"BLD",9537,1,340,0)
 
"BLD",9537,1,341,0)
NOTE: Use the appropriate Institution(s) entries for your facility.
"BLD",9537,1,342,0)
 
"BLD",9537,1,343,0)
WARNING: Make sure there are no other entries in the LABORATORY TEST file 
"BLD",9537,1,344,0)
that have the same name or synonym even though the subscript is
"BLD",9537,1,345,0)
different. 
"BLD",9537,1,346,0)
 
"BLD",9537,1,347,0)
For example:  If there is an existing Bone Marrow with Subscript of 
"BLD",9537,1,348,0)
'Cytology' then you may rename the test to 'Bone Marrow (Cytology)'.
"BLD",9537,1,349,0)
Also if there is a synonym of 'Bone Marrow' then you may rename it to
"BLD",9537,1,350,0)
'Bone Marrow (CY)'.
"BLD",9537,1,351,0)
 
"BLD",9537,1,352,0)
Set all tests up and TYPE NEITHER. When CPRS v32 is available you can 
"BLD",9537,1,353,0)
set the TYPE to BOTH.
"BLD",9537,1,354,0)
 
"BLD",9537,1,355,0)
Workload code configuration should be done in compliance with your 
"BLD",9537,1,356,0)
current Laboratory practices.
"BLD",9537,1,357,0)
 
"BLD",9537,1,358,0)
The PRINT NAME is not important and can be whatever you wish it to be.
"BLD",9537,1,359,0)
 
"BLD",9537,1,360,0)
The ACCESSION AREA should be whatever is in use at your facility as long 
"BLD",9537,1,361,0)
as it is appropriate for the subscript of the test.

Defect #371947 - During Sprint 12 Review demo the SMEs asked if the
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,7,0)
specimen could automatically populate in the Specimen Description [field]
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,8,0)
as that would be important.  The specimen is usually a part of the
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,9,0)
description.  Stuti replied that a decision was made to remove the
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,10,0)
specimen from the Specimen Description; she also pointed out that there is
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,11,0)
a character limitation in Specimen Description.  Dev state that there is a
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,12,0)
"switch" in the configuration to turn it on.

Pre-Installation Instructions:
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,321,0)
-------------------------------------
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,322,0)
This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,323,0)
recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,324,0)
potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,325,0)
minutes 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,326,0)
to install
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,327,0)
 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,328,0)
1.   The Laboratory ADPAC will need to create thirteen new lab tests to 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,329,0)
      support the CPRS AP DIALOG functionality. These tests must be set up
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,330,0)
     with a collection sample of AP SPECIMEN.
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,331,0)
 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,332,0)
     If the COLLECTION SAMPLE file does not have an AP SPECIMEN entry
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,333,0)
    refer to Section 2.2 of the following document:
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,334,0)
          LEDI IV Installation Guide (Lab_Ledi_IV_Install_Guide.pd)
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,335,0)
 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,336,0)
 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,337,0)
2.   Add thirteen new tests to the LABORATORY TEST file. Below are
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,338,0)
     examples of what the AP tests should look like in the LABORATORY TEST
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,339,0)
     File (#60) once the entries have been created. 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,340,0)
 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,341,0)
NOTE: Use the appropriate Institution(s) entries for your facility.
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,342,0)
 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,343,0)
WARNING: Make sure there are no other entries in the LABORATORY TEST file 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,344,0)
that have the same name or synonym even though the subscript is
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,345,0)
different. 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,346,0)
 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,347,0)
For example:  If there is an existing Bone Marrow with Subscript of 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,348,0)
'Cytology' then you may rename the test to 'Bone Marrow (Cytology)'.
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,349,0)
Also if there is a synonym of 'Bone Marrow' then you may rename it to
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,350,0)
'Bone Marrow (CY)'.
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,351,0)
 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,352,0)
Set all tests up and TYPE NEITHER. When CPRS v32 is available you can 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,353,0)
set the TYPE to BOTH.
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,354,0)
 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,355,0)
Workload code configuration should be done in compliance with your 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,356,0)
current Laboratory practices.
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,357,0)
 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,358,0)
The PRINT NAME is not important and can be whatever you wish it to be.
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,359,0)
 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,360,0)
The ACCESSION AREA should be whatever is in use at your facility as long 
"PKG",26,22,1,"PAH",1,1,361,0)
as it is appropriate for the subscript of the test.
