 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC000001299396  -  Unable to see collection times when orders are
                        printed
     
    Problem:
    ------------
    When the order report prints out on the LOG DEVICE FOR LC orders,
    the collection time either doesn't print or wraps to the next line
    when the provider's name is very long.
    
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify the print line to print only the first 25 characters of the
    provider's name.
  
    Routine: LROW2P 
  
 2. INC000001305045 - LRDUZ variable does not get cleaned up
    
    Problem:
    --------
    The LRDUZ variable does not get cleaned up after CPT codes (Current
    Procedural Terminology) are entered in Anatomic Pathology causing the
    pathologist's name to be linked to unrelated orders in LRENTER 
    [Enter/verify/modify data (manual)].
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    New the variable LRDUZ in routine LRCAPES so that the variable does
    not linger after CPT codes are entered, corrupting subsequent 
    laboratory application processes.
     
    Routine: LRCAPES 
  
 3. INC000000890418 -  SNOMED CT STS extract issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    If there is an ABBREVIATION field (#6) entry in the TOPOGRAPHY file 
    (#61) entry that is the same as the NAME field (#.01) entry, the SNOMED
    (Systemitized Nomenclature of Medicine) extract does not pick up the 
    TOPOGTAPHY file entry.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRSRVR6 to include the Topography file entry in the
    SNOMED extract if the ABBREVIATION field is the same as the NAME field.
  
    Routines: LRSRVR6 
  
     ==================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====================
     The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
     can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system. 
  
     NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
           problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*460.
  
       When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES//, choose 'NO'.
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
