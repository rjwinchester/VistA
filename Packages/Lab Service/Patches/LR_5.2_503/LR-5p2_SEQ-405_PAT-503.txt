Subject: MONTHLY ACCESSION AREA REPORTS / LRAP INACTIVE PROVIDERS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two (2) VistA Laboratory issues:
 (1) Statistical reports might list inaccurate information for monthly 
     accession areas.
 (2) Inactive providers are displayed during Anatomic Pathology Log-In.

 Blood Bank Review:
 ==================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*503 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*503 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*503 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
  
 I17282424FY18 - Monthly Accession Area Statistical Reports
  
 Problem:
 -------
  
 The reports "Accession and test counts by shift" and "Count accessioned 
 tests" will list inaccurate information if the starting date specified by 
 the user is within the month of the ending date specified.
  
 Resolution: 
 ----------
  
 Modify routines LRUPACA and LRUPACS to correctly set the starting date 
 for the month being selected.
  
 Routines: LRUPACA and LRUPACS
  
  
 I18078546FY18 - Anatomic Pathology Log-In for Inactive Providers
  
 Problem:
 -------
  
 Inactive providers may be selected as ordering providers when logging in 
 Anatomic Pathology specimens.
    
 Resolution: 
 ----------
  
 Add logic to the data dictionary fields for the Autopsy "Physician" field,
 the Cytopathology "Physician" field, the Surgical Pathology "Surgeon/
 Physician" field, and the Electron Microscopy "Physician" field that only
 active providers who hold the "Provider" key are available for selection.
  
    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   Install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*503'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//, 
       choose 'NO'. 
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Compare the checksums of the routines to the "After" checksums listed in 
 the patch description.

 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and
 participation of development team and appropriate VA site/region
 personnel. The decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint
 decision between development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 The routines can be restored to the previous versions by installing from
 the backup MailMan message that was sent before installation.
  
 Since this patch contains a Data Dictionary change which is only editable 
 by a programmer, an edit must be done directly to the following globals 
 so that the entries are:
  
 ^DD(63,12.1,0)="PHYSICIAN^*P200'^VA(200,^AU;12^S DIC(""S"")=""I $D(^VA(

 Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
 ----------------------------------
 Checksums of the routines can be compared to the "Before" values listed 
 in the patch description.
  
 Since this patch contains a Data Dictionary change, a FileMan 
 display can be used to validate execution of a roll back.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;5.2;LAB SERVICE;**[Patch List]**;Sep 27, 1994;Build 11

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.
