 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1. I9655774FY16 - LEDI Microbiology Results Endless Loop Issue 
  
    Problem:
    -------
  
    An endless loop may occur during Laboratory Electronic Data Interchange
    (LEDI) processing of Microbiology. In this situation, the results have
    been received at a collecting site from the host site which performed
    the testing.  However, an issue exists with the results preventing the
    results from being merged to the collecting site's patient files.  
    Normally, an error file is set containing details about the problem.
    If that error file was not set, an endless loop will occur.  This will
    result in other tasked jobs hanging and waiting for files locked by
    LEDI such as the nightly Lab Rollover process.  This situation has
    occurred at one site, and potentially could occur at other sites which
    use LEDI for Microbiology tests.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routine LRVRMI0 to check for the existence of the error array
    before entering the line of code which could cause an endless loop.
  
    Routine: LRVRMI0
  
 2. I11471766FY17 - Lapsed/Canceled Orders and Added Test Issue 
  
    Problem:
    -------
    If all tests on an order have been lapsed/canceled and if a user adds 
    another test, the CPRS Orders Tab has a confusing display which makes
    it difficult for physicians and other users to determine which are
    active or completed orders vs canceled orders. For workflow and other
    reasons, tests should not be added to orders which have been completely
    canceled. (Note: This ticket was submitted because tests were sometimes
    being added to orders that were more than 30-60 days old and had been
    automatically canceled by the Lapsed Order process.)
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routine LRCE to not allow the adding of a test to an order which
    is completely canceled.  Display a message to the user that the test
    should be ordered with a new order number. The message will appear like
    this:
  
           This order has been canceled.
           Tests WILL NOT be added.  A new order must be placed.
  
    Routine: LRCE

    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   Install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*486'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//, 
       choose 'NO'. 
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
  
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions
