Subject: NLT/LOINC V2.64 UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Laboratory Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) are
 intended to incorporate efficiencies in the Department of Veterans
 Affairs (VA) VistA Laboratory system in relationship to regular updates 
 to the LOINC in use.  The LAB LOINC file (#95.3) currently contains LOINC
 version 2.63 which was released in 2018.  Goal of this patch is the update
 of 95.3 LAB LOINC and Related Files to the current 2.64 version.

 Modification of 64 WKLD CODE file.
 =====================================
  
 There is the special treatment to transfer WKLD file 64. This file 
 cannot be shipped like the other files which delete all data in each file 
 and then copy all data that is shipped. This routine copies the entire 
 file #64 to the TRANSPORT sub-file (field #17) of the LAB NLT/CPT CODES 
 file (#64.81). The post install routine of patch LR511 uses file #64.81 to 
 update file #64 on site.
  
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ==================================================
 Software being released as a host file 
  
 KIDS Distribution Host File:                LR_52_511.KID  (ASCII)
  
 The host file is 60 MB in size and could take up to 3 to 5 minutes to SFTP.
  
    The preferred method is to SFTP the files from download.vista.domain.ext,
    which will transmit the files from the first available SFTP server.
  
    The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular SFTP
    location at the following locations:
  
         Hines           domain.ext
         Salt Lake       domain.ext
  
         Files are available in the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory. 
  
         Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library

 Patch Installation:
 ===================
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ===============================
 The pre-installation routine/tag:  PRE^LR511
 The Post-installation routine/tag: POST^LR511
  
   
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ==============================
 Size/Disk Space Requirements
  
         The changes to the LAB globals will result in a combined growth
         of about 62 MB of data.  Make sure there is sufficient space for
         the growth to the VistA globals.
  
 If this is the reinstallation, please call support center for assistance,
 if this is regular (first) installation, please process with next step.
  
 **IMPORTANT**: Back up the Laboratory global data files; this is 
 necessary if the data must be restored.
  
 Back up data files using your site's policy for backing up data.
 If the steps are unknown, here is a way it can be done:
 1.      Go to a command prompt.
 2.      At the prompt, enter D GOGEN^%ZSPECIAL.
 3.      At the device prompt, enter the name of the local directory where
         the file is to be stored with the name of the file.
         (EX: VA5$:[SITEDIR]PRE_LR511_DATA_FILE_BKUP_YYYYMMDD.GBL)
 4.      At the Parameters? Prompt, press <enter>.
 5.      At the Global prompt, enter the file globals below
  
             LAB LOINC                   #95.3        ^LAB(95.3,
             LAB LOINC COMPONENT         #95.31       ^LAB(95.31,
             WKLD CODE                   #64          ^LAM
             WKLD SUFFIX CODES           #64.2        ^LAB(64.2,
             LAB ELECTRONIC CODES        #64.061      ^LAB(64.061,
  
 6.      Verify that the file was created and exists in the directory specified.
  
 These backup files may get as large as 50 MB.  Make sure space is available
 before proceeding.
 It should take from 5 to 10 minutes to create the backup files.

 Installation Instructions
 ===========================
 LABORATORY USERS MUST LIMIT ACCESSIONING OF SPECIMENS OR VERIFYING 
 OF RESULTS DURING THE INSTALLATION; PATCH INSTALLATION SHOULD OCCUR 
 DURING NON-PEAK PERIODS FOR THE LAB.
  
 No laboratory background jobs need to be stopped. No options need to be 
 placed out of service.
  
 All users may remain on the system. Installation time is less than 30 
 minutes. An Alert is sent to G.LMI when the install starts and finishes.
  
 Note: The patch should be installed during off peak hours.
   
 Note: System may hang while performing the Full Comparison of 
 the Compare Transport Global
  
 Part of installation is the Symbol Table is dumped into Error trap.
 The Error without label can be seen.
 This may help to trace any issue from installation.
  
  
     1)  From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
         the Installation menu
  
     2)  From this menu, select the option Load a Distribution and select
         LR_52_511.KID 
  
     3)  KIDS Installation:
  
         Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action
         "Install Package(s)" and the install name LR*5.2*511.
  
           Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during
           the install?" prompt.
  
           Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
           Menu Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
  
         The KIDs install should take from 4-9 minutes
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 ===============================
      Cleanup
            The PRE and POST installation routine LR511 may be deleted using
            the KERNEL option 'Delete Routines' [XTRDEL] upon completion of
            the installation.
  
 BACKOUT PROCEDURE
 =================
 To back-out data from a production account could cause broken pointers,
 cause <UNDEFINED> errors and hard MUMPS crashes.  The back-out plan for
 data only patches is to "Report the findings and wait for a repair patch."
 Contact the Enterprise Service Desk to log an Incident to the
 NTL.APP.VISTA.Lab.General which assigns the ticket to the appropriate
 National Support team.
