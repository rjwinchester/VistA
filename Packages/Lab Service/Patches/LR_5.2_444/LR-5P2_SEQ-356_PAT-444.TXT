Subject: ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO TESTS NOT ACCESSIONING

Category: 
  - Routine
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 5 issues in the LAB SERVICE package:
  
 1.  Properly defined tests on an order not accessioning when one test is
     not properly defined.
  
 2.  Improperly defined test causes subsequent tests/orders to not be
     accessioned.
  
 3.  No warnings when panel test can't be accessioned.
  
 4.  Howdy accessioning sometimes generates an <UNDEFINED> error.
  
 5.  Accession labels sometimes don't print in Howdy.
  
  
 BLOOD BANK IMPACT:
 =================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*444 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by

 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*444 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*444 have no effect on Blood

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1.  INC000000994803 - Lab Howdy: Accessioning problem
  
     Patient Safety Issue:
     --------------------
     PSPO #2576
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Following the release of LR*5.2*424, when an order has multiple tests
     and one of the tests has no defined ACCESSION AREA\INSTITUTION or one 
     of the tests has an ACCESSION AREA\INSTITUTION that does not match the
     DIVISION assigned to the Howdy User, none of the tests on the order
     are accessioned.
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify routines LROE2 and LRWLST to allow all properly defined
     tests on an order to be accessioned.
  
     Routine:  LROE2, LRWLST
  
  
 2.  INC000000994604 - Lab Collection Build issue
  
     Problem:
     --------
     A collection list is built by hospital location.  Following the   
     release of LR*5.2*424, when a test cannot be accessioned
     during a collection list build, tests/orders for all locations
     that follow will also not be accessioned.
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify routines LROE2 and LRWLST to allow subsequent test to be 
     accessioned when a collection list contains a test that cannot be 
     accessioned because it does not have a defined accession area.
  
     Routine:  LROE2, LRWLST
  
  
 3.  INC000000985017 - Accessioning failure with cosmic tests
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When a panel test is defined without an accession area and some of
     the associated atomic tests can't be accessioned because they are 
     not defined with an appropriate division/accession area, there is
     no alert message/warning for the panel test similar to the message
     that is displayed for atomic tests. 
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify routine LRWLST to display an alert/warning for the panel
     when a panel test has no division/accession area and 1 or more
     of the associated atomic tests also has no division/accession area
     and thus can't be accessioned.
  
     Routine:  LRWLST
  
  
 4.  INC000001003111 - Accessioning <UNDEFINED> error
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When an ordered test has an Accessioning Division (Institution)
     other than the user's division, the accessioning process in Howdy
     can fail with an <UNDEFINED> error in the background task.
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify routine LRHYPH2 to correct this problem.
  
     Routine:   LRHYPH2
  
  
 5.  INC000001043103 - Howdy: Some accession labels do not print
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When a lab order has tests that split into multiple specimen
     numbers in file 69 (Laboratory Orders), and the test with the
     lower specimen number is properly defined with an appropriate
     division/accession area, while a test on a higher specimen
     is not properly defined, the first test (lower specimen number)
     will accession but no label will print.
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify routine LRHYPH2 to print the labels when tests have
     been accessioned.
  
     Routine:   LRHYPH2
  
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can be
 installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
 1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
     option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
 2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
     system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
 3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
     select the 'Installation' menu.
  
 4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
     that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
 5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
     options:
  
     Print Transport Global
     Compare Transport Global to Current System
     Backup a Transport Global
  
     If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
     patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
     Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
     your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
     'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
 6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
     and select the package 'LR*5.2*444'.
  
     When prompted, 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
     When prompted, 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
