 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 ======================
 1. INC000001074620 
   
    Problem:
    -------
    When using option "Multipurpose accessioning" [LRQUICK], all tests on a
    specimen number in LAB ORDER ENTRY file (#69) that can be accessioned
    will be accessioned. However, if one or more of the tests on the
    specimen number cannot be accessioned because there is no Accession
    Area defined for the test, then the specimen number will show as
    uncollected and results will not be able to be entered for the tests on
    the specimen number that were successfully accessioned.
   
    Solution:
    --------
    Modify routine LRWLST to mark the specimen number as collected once the
    specimen number has gone through the accessioning process. 
   
    Routines: LRWLST
  
  
 2. INC000001218249
  
    Problem:
    -------
    If an order is placed for a lab test that is a panel test which has
    as one of its components another panel test, the accessioning process
    for this lab order will result in an erroneous test node being set
    into the LAB ORDER ENTRY file (#69).
      
    Solution:
    --------
    Modify routine LRWLST to not set the erroneous test node in file #69
    when the situation described above occurs.

 ====================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ======================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. 
 This patch may be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
   
 1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
     option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
 2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
     system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
 3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
     select the 'Installation' menu.
  
 4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
     that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
 5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
     options:
  
     Print Transport Global
     Compare Transport Global to Current System
     Backup a Transport Global
  
     If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
     patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
     Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
     your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
     'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
 6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
     and select the package 'LR*5.2*466.
  
     When  prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
