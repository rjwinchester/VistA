Subject: DELTA CHECKS, EXECUTE CODES, INTERIM REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following 3 issues:
  
 1. Execute code does not perform correctly when a lab test is added to a
    previously verified accession.
  
 2. Convert delta checks to new format.
  
 3. <STORE> error when array fills up in micro

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC000000069071 - Type of DELTA check problem (EXECUTE CODE PROBLEM)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The EXECUTE CODE file (#62.07) is used to store a variety of program
    instructions that are used in various programs in the LAB package.
  
    The execute code should be performed at both the start and the end of
    the data review/edit of lab test results but if a test is added to an
    already resulted/verified accession, the execute code is only performed
    at the beginning of the data review/edit.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRVER4 to always perform the EXECUTE code at both the
    beginning and the end of the review/edit of lab test results.
  
    Routine: LRVER4  
  
 2. INC000000914053 - Lab - LEDI 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    LEDI IV (LR*5.2*350) converted references to the execution of delta 
    checks to a new coding format. A reference was overlooked in routine
    LRVR5. 
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRVR5 to invoke the delta check processing in the new 
    coding format for consistency.
  
    Routine:  LRVR5  
  
 3. INC000000955950 - Lab: Microbiology
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Coding to put lines of text into an array for printing in a window 
    leads to <STORE> error as array fills up partition under unusual
    circumstances.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routines LRMIPSZ5 and LR7OSMZ5 to handle all circumstances when 
    formatting the text to be printed in the window.
  
    Routine: LRMIPSZ5, LR7OSMZ5
  
    ==================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====================
  
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can
    be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
          problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*437'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
