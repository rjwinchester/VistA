 Overview:
  
 This patch introduces additional International Classification of Diseases,
 Tenth Revision (ICD-10) implementation-related modifications into the
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 Laboratory V5.2 package.  The enhancements being made support the existing
 business processes in the Emerging Pathogens Initiative (EPI) and Anatomic
 Pathology modules. 
  
 Scope:
  
 The scope of this effort supports implementation of ICD-10 within the
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  The conversion from ICD-9 to ICD-10
 requires that all VistA connected applications, back-end processes,
 databases and the Patient Treatment File (PTF) support twenty-five (25)
 ICD diagnosis and procedure codes.
  
 The Laboratory Emerging Pathogens Initiative (EPI) application allows the 
 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to track certain emerging pathogens 
 on the national level without the necessity for additional local data 
 entry.  It is designed to automatically provide data on emerging 
 pathogens to Veterans Affairs Headquarters (VAHQ) without additional 
 individual data entry at the site level. Functionality in this 
 application includes using look up capabilities to add, delete, edit, or 
 view ICD codes for pathogen set-up parameters. Once parameters have been 
 decided, an extract automatically searches for specific ICD codes related 
 to certain emerging pathogens (e.g., Hepatitis, Legionella). The data is 
 sent to the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) for initial 
 processing and coupling with denominator data related to workload. 
 Veterans Affairs Headquarters (VAHQ) data retrieval and analysis can then 
 be accomplished.  Plans can be formulated on the national level for 
 intervention strategies and resource needs. Results of aggregate data can 
 also be shared with appropriate public health authorities for planning on 
 the national level for the non-VA and private health care sectors.
  
 Functional Overview:
  
 With the release of Registration patch DG*5.3*884, the Patient Treatment
 File (PTF #45) now supports up to 25 ICD diagnosis Codes.  This patch
 enhances the Laboratory package to utilize a new Application Programmer
 Interface (API) to obtain PTF related diagnosis codes for reporting.
  
 * Patch LR*5.2*442 makes the following changes to the Emerging Pathogens 
   Initiative (EPI) module:
   
   - Data related to specific emerging pathogens is collected and sent to 
     the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC).  The messages will
     now have to accommodate up to 25 ICD-10 diagnosis codes associated
     with a single EPI data record.
  
 * Patch LR*5.2*442 makes the following changes to the Anatomic Pathology 
   (AP) module:
  
   - For the tissue review case report modifications will be made to the 
     retrieving and displaying the up to twenty-five (25) ICD diagnosis, 
     Present on Admission (POA) indicators, and Procedure and Surgical
     Codes that can now be stored in the PTF (#45).

 Software & Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ------------------------------------------------ 
 The software for this set of patches is not being distributed through the 
 National Patch Module. 
  
 Patch DG*5.3*884 (Registration) is being released along with GMTS*2.7*111
 (Health Summary), IB*2.0*522 (Integrated Billing), LR*5.2*442 (Lab
 Service), ROR*1.5*25 (Clinical Case Registries), and OR*3.0*406
 (Order Entry/Results Reporting) in a multi-package build (host
 file).
  
 Because this is a multi-package build, it can only be distributed as a
 host file; no builds are included in the patch messages. The name of the
 host file is: ICD_10_PTF_MODIFICATIONS.KID; it can be obtained from one of
 the anonymous file transfer protocol (ftp) directories listed below. 
  
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
 patch is also available and can be obtained from one of the anonymous ftp
 directories listed below. 
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from: 
  
  ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as 
 follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Hines          ftp.domain.ext   <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  
 Note: 
  - Please use the 'Binary' transfer method for retrieval of .pdf files
  - Please use the 'ASCII' transfer method for retrieval of .KID files
