Subject: TESTS NOT GETTING TO HDR, WRONG ORDER STATUS IN FILE 100

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 2 issues:
  
 1. Some patients' lab test results are not getting transmitted to the
    Health Data Repository (HDR). 
  
 2. When lab orders are "merged-from" or "merged-to" orders, the entry in
    the ORDERS file (#100) is updated with incorrect statuses as the tests
    are accessioned and then resulted.

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1. I9920136FY16 - Failure of merged lab collect orders to transmit to
                   HDR
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Multiple lab collect orders for the same patient and the same day/time
    are merged when the collection list is built. If the "merged-from"
    order contains the same test that is the first test on the "merged-to"
    order, the entries in the LA7 Message Queue file (#62.49) that are
    meant for the HDR (Health Data Repository) are not generated.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LR7OB1 to generate the HDR messages when this unusual
    situation occurs.
  
    Routines: LR7OB1 
  
 2. I7916463FY16 - Lab order merging leads to incorrect Status of file
                   100 orders
  
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO #2621
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Patients may have old Lab orders displayed on the CPRS Orders tab with 
    an "active" status, even though those orders may have been completed by
    lab.  Active orders cannot be cancelled by a provider; however these 
    orders are months and even years old and therefore the validity of the 
    active status is questionable. The patient risk is that the presence of
    these old "active" Lab orders can lead to confusion for users reviewing
    the chart as they may not be able to determine the current status of
    the order and if it is still relevant.
  
    It was determined that when lab orders are merged and the "merged-from"
    order has a test that is also on the "merged-to" order, the entry in
    the ORDERS file #100 that is associated with the "merged-from" test
    gets updated with an incorrect status as the test is accessioned and
    then resulted.
  
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LR7OB1 to update only the status of the ORDERS file #100
    entry of the duplicated test that is on the "merged-to" order.
     
    Routine: LR7OB1 
  
    NOTE: This patch prevents the problem from occurring. Regarding
          correction of past orders affected by this problem, a utility to
          determine those orders is not provided in this patch due to the
          low patient safety risk involved. However, if specific instances
          of problematic orders are found, facilities can submit a Help
          Desk ticket for assistance in correcting.
