 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1. I14578932FY17: Override Reference Ranges Not Displaying on Reports
  
    Problem:
    -------
    Override reference ranges entered manually in the option 
    Enter/verify/modify data (manual) [LRENTER] are not stored in the LAB
    DATA (#63) file.  Instead, reference ranges from the LABORATORY TEST
    (#60) file are stored and subsequently displayed on the patient
    report.  This could cause an incorrect interpretation of the test
    results.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modify routine LRVER4 to not store the values from the LABORATORY TEST
    (#60) file if override values have been added by the user for this 
    accession.
  
 2. I14605853FY17: Option LRENTER Prompt Answer of "YES" Treated as "NO"
  
    Problem:
    -------
    If a user answers "YES" to the prompt "Use these values?", which 
    pertains to override reference ranges, the option will treat the answer
    as "NO" and display the additional reference range prompts. Laboratory 
    personnel must spend additional time returning through prompts which
    they indicated they did not wish to view, when answering "YES".
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modify routine LRVER5 to treat the "YES" answer as intended, so that
    additional reference range prompts are not displayed for user input.
  
    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*488'.
  
       When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'. 
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
