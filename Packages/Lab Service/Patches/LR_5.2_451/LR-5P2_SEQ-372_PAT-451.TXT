  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Laboratory Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) are 
 intended to incorporate efficiencies in the Department of Veterans 
 Affairs (VA) VistA Laboratory system in relationship to regular updates 
 to the LOINC in use.  The LAB LOINC file (#95.3) currently contains LOINC 
 version 2.14 which was released in 2007.  Goal of this patch is the update
 of 95.3 LAB LOINC and Related Files to the current 2.52 version.
  
 Files updated in this patch:
 95.3      LAB LOINC
 95.31     LAB LOINC COMPONENT
 64        WKLD CODE
 64.061    LAB ELECTRONIC CODES
 64.2      WKLD SUFFIX CODES
 64.21     WKLD CODE LAB SECT
  
 BLOOD BANK CLEARANCE
 ====================
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*451 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*451 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*451 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 DATA DICTIONARY MODIFICATIONS
 =============================
 Modification of 95.3 LAB LOINC file:
 =====================================
 Field #95.3,20 was modified as follows:
 Two new members of the SET were added:
         Code 2 = TRIAL
         Code 3 = DISCOURAGED
  
 95.3,20       STATUS                 4;1 SET
  
                                 '1' FOR DEL; 
                                 '2' FOR TRIAL; 
                                 '3' FOR DISCOURAGED; 
  
 New LAB LOINC file (#95.3) Data Elements
 This section describes the new data elements being added to the LAB LOINC 
 file (#95.3).
  
 The following are the data elements have been added:
  
 95.3,82       VA COMMON DISPLAY NAME 82;E1,100 FREE TEXT
  
 Field #95.3,83
 95.3,83       LONG COMMON NAME       83;E1,245 FREE TEXT
  
 Field #95.3,84 
 95.3,84       EXTERNAL COPYRIGHT NOTICE 84;0   WORD-PROCESSING #95.384
                      (IGNORE "|")
  
 Field #95.3,85 
 95.3,85       EXAMPLE UCUM UNITS     85;E1,245 FREE TEXT
  
 Field #95.3,86 
 95.3,86       REPEAT OBSERVATION     86;E1,245 FREE TEXT
  
 There is the special treatment to transfer WKLD file 64. This file 
 cannot be shipped like the other files which delete all data in each file 
 and then copy all data that is shipped. This routine copies the entire 
 file #64 to the TRANSPORT sub-file (field #17) of the LAB NLT/CPT CODES 
 file (#64.81). The post install routine of patch LR451 uses file #64.81 to 
 update file #64 on site.
  
 SFTP SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL:
 =======================
  
 KIDS Distribution Host File:                LR_52_451.KID  (ASCII)
  
 The host file is 55 MB in size and could take up to 3 to 5 minutes to SFTP.
  
    The preferred method is to SFTP the files from download.vista.domain.ext,
    which will transmit the files from the first available SFTP server.
  
    The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular SFTP
    location at the following locations:
  
         Hines           domain.ext
         Albany          domain.ext
         Salt Lake       domain.ext
  
         Files are available in the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory. 
  
 KIDS Installation:
 ==================
  
 Size/Disk Space Requirements
 ============================
         The changes to the LAB globals will result in a combined growth
         of about 50 MB of data.  Make sure there is sufficient space for
         the growth to the VistA globals.
  
 Before Installation:
 ====================
 If this is the reinstallation, please call support center for assistance,
 if this is regular (first) installation, please process with next step.
  
 **IMPORTANT**: Back up the Laboratory global data files; this is 
 necessary if the data must be restored.
  
 Back up data files using your site's policy for backing up data.
 If the steps are unknown, here is a way it can be done:
 1.      Go to a command prompt.
 2.      At the prompt, enter D GOGEN^%ZSPECIAL.
 3.      At the device prompt, enter the name of the local directory where
         the file is to be stored with the name of the file.
 4.      At the Parameters? Prompt, press <enter>.
 5.      At the Global prompt, enter the file globals below
  
             LAB LOINC                   #95.3        ^LAB(95.3,
             LAB LOINC COMPONENT         #95.31       ^LAB(95.31,
             WKLD CODE                   #64          ^LAM
             WKLD SUFFIX CODES           #64.2        ^LAB(64.2,
             LAB ELECTRONIC CODES        #64.061      ^LAB(64.061,
             WKLD CODE LAB SECT          #64.21       ^LAB(64.21,
  
 6.      Verify that the file was created and exists in the directory specified.
  
 These backup files may get as large as 50 MB.  Make sure space is available
 before proceeding.  It should take from 5 to 10 minutes to create the backup files.
  
 EXAMPLE: 
 VISTA>d GOGEN^%ZSPECIAL
  
 Device: <drive><directory><station>_PRE_LR451_DATA_FILE_BKUP_<current date>.GBL
  
 Where:      <drive> = local drive used to store files
         <directory> = local file directory used to store files
           <station> = VA station number to identify facility
