 BLOOD BANK REVIEW:
 ==================
 VISTA Laboratory Package patch LR*5.2*439 contains changes to software 
 controlled by the ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA 
 Patches. Changes include: 
 Routine:
 LRCENDEL - Modify routine LRCENDEL to Lock the accessions in the LAB DATA 
 file (#63) that are related to the order that is being edited in option
 LRCENDEL.
  
 All of the above changes have been reviewed by the VISTA Blood Bank 
 Developer and found to have no impact on the VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE 
 control functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*439 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*439 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SITES: This patch contains changes to x routines and 
 x files identified in ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA 
 Patches, group B listing. The changes have no effect on Blood Bank 
 functionality or medical device control functions. There is no adverse 
 potential to sites.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: 
 There are no validation requirements by option
  
 MINIMAL TEST CASE SCENARIOS BY OPTION, INCLUSIVE OF ALL CONTROL FUNCTIONS:
 There are no test case scenarios by option.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC000000592999 - Accession number was cancelled/but results still show
                      up in CPRS
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The options, Delete entire order or individual tests [LRCENDEL] and
 Enter/verify/modify data (manual) [LRENTER], can be performed at the same
 time by different users. This allows for tests to show as cancelled in the
 LAB ORDER ENTRY file (#69) when test results have been entered in the LAB
 DATA file (#63).
  
 This is also a problem with the Enter/verify data (auto instrument)
 [LRVR] option.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modify routine LRCENDEL to Lock the accessions in the LAB DATA file (#63) 
 that are related to the order that is being edited in option LRCENDEL.
   
 Routine: LRCENDEL  
  
 2. INC000000960215 - Lab - Other: modified routine LRUMDP
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Routine LRUMDP (W+1) adds "000" to the date/time associated with lab
 results when using the Print/display preselected lab tests [LRUMD] option.
 This does no harm if the date/time has a time, however if the date is
 stored as just the date (no time), it alters the FileMan date to an
 invalid date.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modify routine LRUMDP to not add "000" to the date/time stamp.
     
 Routine: LRUMDP
  
    ==================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====================
  
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
    can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
          to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*439.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
