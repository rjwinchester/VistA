Subject: MICRO FIXES FOR CLASS I INTERFACE TO MICROBIOLOGY INSTRUMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
  This patch addresses the following issues:
  - Microbiology accession is being removed from the 'Incomplete 
  test status report (LRWRKINC)' option when a PRELIMINARY result is
  released when using the Universal Interface Microbiology release options.
  - When processing result messages received from the Universal Interface  
  all data will be added and it will be up to the Microbiology 
  Technologists to determine what values will go out with preliminary and 
  final reports.
  
    
   Blood Bank Review:
   ==================
   EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*480 does not 
   alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
   elements functions.
    
   RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*480 have no effect on Blood 
   Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
    
   VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
   made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
   installation of this patch.

  Problem:
  --------
  When releasing a microbiology preliminary report using the new 
  Universal Interface release options the status of the accession was being
  set to complete and was then no longer available on the Incomplete Test
  Status list report.
     
  Resolution:
  -----------
  The patch modifies LRVR0 at ACCEPT+68 and adds the following three lines
  of code:
          ;
          ; If Lab UI interface then prompt user for accession test 
  complete date /time in EC3^LRMIEDZ2 call.
          I LRINTYPE=1 S LRFIFO=0
   
         Routine: LRVR0
  
  
  Problem: 
  --------
  When a retransmission of microbiology results are received the accepting 
  of the retransmission values was causing the existing
  organism, comments and susceptibilities to be deleted. This is expected 
  functionality when handling verified microbiology reports
  from external reference laboratories.  
  
  However when handling result transmission from a Universal Interface 
  microbiology instrument the user can add additional information that
  needs to be preserved before the report is verified.
  
  Resolution: 
  -----------
  The patch modifies the handling of existing results based on the type of 
  interface. LEDI types of interfaces will continue to
  remove previous information prior to storing new information from the 
  reference laboratory. Universal Interfaces type interfaces
  will maintain existing information entered by Laboratory or received via 
  prior transmissions and merge the new transmission with
  the existing data before presenting to lab user for review.

   Pre/Post Installation Overview
   ------------------------------
   There are no Pre/Post installation routines associated with this 
   patch.  
   
   Pre-Installation Instructions
   -----------------------------
   This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is
   recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
   potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than one  
   minute to install.
   
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.
   
     
      ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
    
    
      1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
         option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
    
      2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
         system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
    
      3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
         select the 'Installation' menu.
    
      4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
         that all routines have the correct checksums.
       
      5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
         options:
                 Print Transport Global
                 Compare Transport Global to Current System
                 Backup a Transport Global
    
         If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
         patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a 
         Transport Global' option at this time. You may also compare the
         routines in your production account to the routines in the patch
         by using the 'Compare a Transport Global to Current System'
         option.
    
      6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
         and select the package 'LR*5.2*480.
    
         When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
         NO//", respond NO.  
    
         When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
         and Protocols? NO//", respond NO.
    
   Post-Installation Instructions
   ------------------------------
 Back-Out Procedure:
  
  During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as 
  directed, 'Backup a Transport Global', then routines have the ability to 
  be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was generated.  
  However, the KIDS installation process does not perform a restore of 
  other VistA components, such as data dictionary, cross-reference, and 
  template changes, etc. 
  Prior to attempting a back-out of the software, contact the VA Help Desk 
  at 1-855-673-4357 for support or assistance.
  Restore the backup message of any routines exported with the patches and 
  reload the transport global. 
  Verify the back-out procedure by comparing the transport global to the 
  current system state.
  
 Rollback Procedure:
  
  Patch LR*5.2*480 and any installed dependent patches need to be taken out
  in reverse of the order in which these patches were installed; routines 
  and data dictionary modifications and populated data must also be rolled 
  back in reverse order.
  Contact the VA Help Desk at 1-855-673-4357 for support or assistance 
  regarding roll-back procedures.  
  The need for a rollback is highly unlikely, however if it is required, 
  contact the product development team for assistance if needed.  The 
  rollback procedure may require Lab downtime and a reinstall of any 
  previous KIDS versions.  
  No specific rollback verification procedures are required after the 
  installations of patch LR*5.2*480.
