Subject: LEDI HOST UID INCORRECTLY ASSIGNED

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses one (1) VistA Laboratory issue:
  
 When a Laboratory Electronic Data Interchange (LEDI) host site adds a
 lab test to an accessioned order received from a collection facility, the
 universal identifier (UID) is improperly assigned with the collection
 site's UID instead of the host site's UID.

 Blood Bank Review:
 ==================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*498 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*498 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*498 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
  
 CA-SDM R17422198FY18 - Incorrect UID assigned when adding lab tests.
  
 Problem:
 -------
  
 If the option LRADDTST (Lab add test(s) to an existing order) is used at 
 a Laboratory Electronic Data Interchange (LEDI) host site (i.e. the site 
 performing the tests) to add test to a LEDI order received from a 
 collecting site (i.e. the site ordering the tests), the universal 
 identifier (UID) assigned is the UID from the collecting site.  The UID 
 should be a host site UID.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
  
 Modify routine LRCE so that a host site UID is assigned to the added test 
 which is added at the host site.
  
 NOTE:  LRADDTST (Lab add test(s) to an existing order) cannot be used for 
 tests at the collecting site for LEDI orders if the added tests will have 
 results received from a host site. This option increments the UID and 
 accession, so the UID and accession won't match the UID and accession 
 received from the host site.
  
 The test added at the host site must be added at the collection site using
 option LRADD TO ACC (Add tests to a given accession) before results are
 verified for the original test. Otherwise, the UID will increment. This is
 expected behavior.
  
 Documentation Update:
 --------------------
  
 The Laboratory User Manual Version 5.2 has been updated to include the 
 following clarification concerning option Lab add test(s) to an existing 
 order:
  
 Lab add test(s) to an existing order
  
 Tests on additional specimens may be kept with the original order number 
 using this option. Note that additional accession(s) will be created.
 Note: Because additional accession(s) are created, this option may  
 not be used at a LEDI collecting site to add tests to an order which has 
 been accessioned. If this option is used, the results for the added test 
 will not post through the LEDI interface.

    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   Install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*498'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//, 
       choose 'NO'. 
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
  
 Compare the checksum of routine LRCE to the "After" checksum listed in the
 patch description.
  
 Backout Plan
 ------------
  
 Restore the routine LRCE from the backup MailMan message which was
 generated during patch install.
