 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*512 have no adverse effect on 
 Blood Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 INC1403529: Incorrect CPRS Lab Order Status
  
 Problem:
 -------
  
 Statuses may display incorrectly in CPRS for various situations depending 
 on tests ordered and workflow.  For example, if a panel is incompletely 
 verified (i.e. one or more atomic tests within the panel are pending), 
 the panel status might display as "complete".  If three atomic tests are 
 ordered separately and verified at different times, the first atomic test 
 might revert to an "active" status when it should be "complete".  When 
 Laboratory panels are ordered in combination with other panels, the CPRS 
 status might display incorrectly as "complete" depending on the timing of 
 result verification - whether components within the panels are verified 
 separately, etc. 
  
 Resolution: 
 ----------
  
 Modify routines LRVER1, LRVER3A, LRVR1, and LR7OB3 to ensure that CPRS 
 statuses are correct for panel tests as well as atomic tests.  Atomic 
 tests display as "complete" if result verification is complete.  Panel 
 test statuses display as "complete" only after all components of the 
 panels are verified. These changes apply to manual result verification, 
 instrument and Laboratory Electronic Data Interchange (LEDI) result 
 verification, as well as auto release/verification.
  
 Note: The CPRS order status may display incorrectly for some workflow 
 scenarios after install of this patch if certain configurations are 
 employed.  Examples could include a panel which includes only one 
 accession area among all components and an accession area is not defined 
 for the panel, or if a panel test contains another panel test in the LAB 
 TEST INCLUDED IN PANEL multiple.
  
 It is encouraged in the "super panel" scenario that CPRS Order Sets are
 defined instead. For more information, refer to the Computerized Patient 
 Record System (CPRS) Technical Manual in the VA Software Document Library 
 (VDL) at this link: https://www.domain.ext/vdl/application.asp?appid=61
  
 Routines: LRVER1, LRVER3A, LRVR1, LR7OB3 
  
  
    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   Install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*512'.
  
       When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
       Install? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
       When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
  
 Compare the checksums of the routines to the "after" checksums listed in 
 this patch description.
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
  
 Restore the routines from the backup PackMan message which was generated 
 before patch install. In the event of a catastrophic failure, the 
 Facility CIO may make the decision to back-out the patch.
