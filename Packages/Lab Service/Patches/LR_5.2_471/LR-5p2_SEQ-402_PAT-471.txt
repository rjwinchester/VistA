Subject: LIST MANAGER CPRS RESULTS, IMPROPER PARAMETERS IN DID CALL

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses two (2) issues:
  
 1.   When the legacy CPRS List Manager option CPRS Ward Clerk
      Menu [OR OE/RR MENU WARD CLERK] is used to call Lab 
      package routines (SET1^LRGEN) to display Lab Results by 
      Test, a program error (UNDEFINED) is encountered.
  
 2.   The VistA routine ^LRX performs a FileMan database server
      call ($$GET1^DID) to retrieve a global reference.  The 
      parameters used in the call are improper.

 2.      I12671125FY17 - Improper Parameters in DID Call
  
 Blood Bank Review:
 ==================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*471 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*471 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*471 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of
 installation of this patch.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1.      I9697620FY16 - List Manager CPRS Error
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the legacy CPRS List Manager option CPRS Ward Clerk Menu 
 [OR OR/RR MENU WARD CLERK] is used to call Lab package routines
 (SET1^LRGEN) to display Lab Results by Test, a program error 
 (UNDEFINED) is encountered.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The patch modifies code in routine LRGEN1 to assure that the 
 undefined variable (LRIOM) is initialized.
  
 Routines: LRGEN1
  
 2.      I12671125FY17 - Improper Parameters in DID Call
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The VistA routine ^LRX performs a FileMan database server call 
 ($$GET1^DID) to retrieve a global reference.  The parameters used
 in the call are improper.  In particular, the routine passes the 
 parameter as the literal "1" (1,+LRDPF) rather than the file number
 as described in the FileMan Developer's Guide.
  
 Until the Laboratory Package is patched, FileMan has been modified
 to provide compatibility with this improper code by setting the 
 passed arguments properly if the first parameter is a literal "1".
 This patch will eliminate the need for that special code.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The patch modifies code in routine LRX to assure that the ^DID
 call is correct.
  
 Routines: LRX
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ==============================
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch 
    can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
          problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
    Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following
    options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch LR*5.2*471:
    a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with this patch. It will not backup any 
       other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will (allow
       you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is 
       installed.  It compares all components of this patch routines, DDs, 
       templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you to
       ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
       global.
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    choose the patch to install.
  
 5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//'
    choose 'NO'.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? NO//' choose 'NO'.
  
 7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Backout/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksums match
 the pre-patch checksums from the patch description.
