Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_Production_Overview_Guide_Groups_3_4.pdf) posted on the
 Anonymous directory for installation order. This is critical for 
 proper functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the ICD-10 activation date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
 systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
 which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research. 
  
 ===============================  WARNING  ================================
  
 The ICD-10 Class I Remediation project will update VistA to include the
 ICD-10 Diagnosis and Procedure codes. The first patches to be delivered
 by this project will be the STS patches ICD*18.0*57 and LEX*2.0*80 which 
 will include both the ICD-10 Diagnosis and Procedure codes along with new
 or updated APIs that will be used by the other VistA applications to
 select, retrieve and display these new codes.
  
 There are several VistA applications that do not currently utilize code
 set versioning. Those applications are Prosthetics, Home Based Primary
 Care, and Lab Anatomic Pathology. As a result, these applications
 currently allow inactive ICD-9 codes to be displayed and selected for
 ICD-9 dates of service.
  
 During the interim, after the installation of the STS ICD-10 Class I
 Remediation patches and prior to the ICD-10 Implementation date, these 
 applications will also allow the display and selection of inactive ICD-10 
 codes including statuses of (Inactive) or (Pending). The users of these 
 applications should use CAUTION to select ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes that are 
 appropriate and active.
  
 The following examples show how the software would appear in these
 applications:
  
 EXAMPLE #1: Inactive ICD-9 codes.
 The warning (Inactive) appears at the end of the short description.
  
 Select ICD DIAGNOSIS: 100.0// 488.1
  
  4 matches found
  
     1.  488.1     FLU DT IDEN H1N1 VIRUS (Inactive)
     2.  488.11    FLU DT 2009 H1N1 W PNEU (Major CC)
     3.  488.12    FLU-2009 H1N1 W OTH RESP
     4.  488.19    FLU-2009 H1N1 W OTH MAN (Inactive)
  
  Select 1-4:  
  
 Select ICD DIAGNOSIS: 
  
 EXAMPLE #2: Inactive ICD-10 codes.
 The warning (Pending) appears at the end of the short description.
  
 Select ICD DIAGNOSIS: 100.0// A27.
  
 4 matches found
  
     1.  A27.0     Leptospirosis icterohemorrhagica (10/01/2014)
                   (Pending)
     2.  A27.81    Aseptic meningitis in leptospirosis (10/01/2014)
                   (Pending)
     3.  A27.89    Other forms of leptospirosis (10/01/2014) (Pending) 
     4.  A27.9     Leptospirosis, unspecified (10/01/2014) (Pending)    
  
 When creating or editing records dated after the ICD-10 Activation Date
 (10/01/2014), the software will correctly screen out both the inactive
 ICD-9 and inactive ICD-10 codes.
 ===========================  END OF WARNING  =============================
  
  
 The following functionality within the Anatomic Pathology (AP) application
 addresses ICD-10 enhancements.
  
 1. Option Updates
    The following options are modified to replace the word "ICD9CM" to "ICD".
    a) "Autopsy protocol & ICD9CM coding [LRAPAUDAA]" is changed to "Autopsy
       protocol & ICD coding [LRAPAUDAA]".
    b) "ICD9CM coding, anat path [LRAPICD]" is changed to "ICD coding, anat 
       path [LRAPICD]".
    c) "FS/Gross/Micro/Dx/ICD9CM Coding [LRAPDGI]" is changed to
       "FS/Gross/Micro/Dx/ICD Coding [LRAPDGI]".
    d) "ICD9CM code search [LRAPSI]" is changed to "ICD code search [LRAPSI]".
  
 2. Data Entry Updates 
    Autopsy (AU), Cytopathology (CY), Electron Microscopy (EM), and Surgical 
    Pathology (SP) data entry screens now allow the entry and display of the 
    relevant ICD code sets based on the date of interest. The date of interest
    for AU is the Autopsy Date/Time. The date of interest for CY, EM, and SP 
    is date the specimen is received.  
    a) If the date of interest is prior to the ICD-10 activation date,
       then ICD-9 codes are available for data entry selection.
    b) If the date of interest is after the ICD-10 activation date, 
       then ICD-10 codes are available for data entry selection.
    c) Screen prompts and displays are modified to replace the word "ICD9CM" 
       to "ICD".
    d) The "Select ICD DIAGNOSIS CODE NUMBER:" prompt in the ICD code search
       [LRAPSI] is changed to "Select ICD Diagnosis:"
  
 3. Report Updates
    The following reports are modified.
    a) ICD code search [LRAPSI]
       - The date range prompt and the Select ICD Diagnosis prompt are
         interchanged so that the ICD coding set displayed is based on an ICD 
         coding date. 
       - A warning message displays if the dates entered overlap the 
         ICD coding system. The warning message is shown below:-
          
          Beginning and Ending dates must both be prior to <Actual ICD-10
          Activation Date will display here>(ICD-9) 
            or  both be on or after <Actual ICD-10 Activation Date will 
            display here>(ICD-10).
       - A search string displays findings based on a particular ICD coding
         system. For example, if the dates entered are for ICD-9, then a search 
         of ICD codes will produce a list of ICD-9 codes, and the same will be 
         true for ICD-10 codes.
    b) Five reports are changed to use the API $$ICDDX^ICDEX, instead of 
       $$ICDDX^ICDCODE, to return ICD information based on the relevant ICD 
       coding system.
        - Display surg path reports for a patient [LRAPSPCUM]
        - Display cytopath reports for a patient [LRAPCYCUM]
        - Display EM reports for a patient [LRAPEMCUM]
        - 10% random case review, surg path [LRAPQAR]
        - Tissue committee review cases [LRAPQAT] 
  
    c) An existing problem was corrected in the Tissue committee review cases
       [LRAPQAT] report. Diagnosis codes from the PTF File (#45) were being  
       accumulated from previous patients and displayed for subsequent 
       patients.
     
 4. Data Dictionary Updates
    The field descriptions in the LAB DATA File (#63) are changed to reflect
    the general term "ICD" instead of "ICD9CM".

 HD0000000741712 - ICD10: LRAPSI option doesn't display data for EM section
  
 Problem:  While testing the Anatomic Pathology application for the ICD10
           remediation project, it was noted that the ICD code search [LRAPSI]
           option did not display any details in the Name, ID, Sex, Age, and 
           ACC # columns for the Electron Microscopy (EM) section even though
           the selected ICD code was on file.
  
 Solution: The problem was related to how the M code checked if an ICD code
           existed in File (#63). For all the sections (Autopsy, Cytopathology, 
           and Surgical Pathology), with the exception of Electron Microscopy
           (EM), the ICD code pointer to File (#80) is stored as a subscript in 
           File (#63). When checking for ICD code of EM, the code failed to 
           find any because of the way the data is stored.
