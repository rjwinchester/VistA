 R18600337FY18: Missing Anatomic Pathology Alerts
 R19264009FY18 (d)
  
 Problem:
 -------
  
 Alerts might not be generated after Anatomic Pathology cases are verified.
 Several sites are finding that alerts are not generating after some cases 
 are verified.  The issue is not reproducible except by forcing a session 
 disconnect after electronically signing a case but before specifying 
 whether additional alerts should be sent.  It is unknown whether this is
 the scenario causing missing alerts at sites.
  
 Resolution: 
 ----------
 The root cause of this issue is not yet known.  In the meantime, this 
 patch provides a routine and option which will search for missing 
 Anatomic Pathology alerts as well as other issues known to occur along 
 with missing alerts such as fields in the ORDERS (#100) file which are 
 set incorrectly.
  
 After the routine executes, alert(s) and a MailMan message are sent to 
 the"LMI" mail group as well as the user who manually invoked the option
 "Missing AP Alert Search". Recipients of the alerts and MailMan messages
 will then determine whether to manually generate an alert for the cases
 using the already existing option "Send an AP Alert" which is under the
 menu "Verify/release menu, anat path".
  
 The option included in this patch, "Missing AP Alert Search", is placed 
 under the "Supervisor, anat path" menu.  The option may be invoked
 manually and/or defined to be executed automatically by TaskMan.
  
 Various information gathered about issues found is sent in alerts and 
 MailMan messages as well as stored in an ^XTMP("LR AP ALERT TRACE... 
 global.  The information in the ^XTMP subscript will automatically purge 
 after 90 days.  The information is kept for a period of time in the event
 that future research will need to be performed on the Anatomic Pathology
 cases.
   
 NOTE: It is strongly recommended this option be scheduled to run daily. 
 See the Post-Installation Instructions.  If the option is executed by 
 TaskMan, alert(s) and a MailMan message are sent to the user who defined 
 the option in TaskMan as well as members of the "LMI" MailMan group.
  
  
 Routine: LRAPUALT
  
 ^XTMP Example (top level only):
 ------------------------------
  
 ^XTMP("LR AP ALERT TRACE 3181207.1434",0) = purge date, etc.
  
 The search option may be executed manually and/or through TaskMan.  Sites 
 can determine how often the search routine should run.
  
 Manual Execution:
 ----------------
  
 The option included in this patch, "Missing AP Alert Search", is placed 
 under the "Supervisor, anat path" menu.
  
 The option will ask the user which starting and end date should be 
 searched.  The date range pertains to the date that Anatomic Pathology 
 cases are verified.
  
 After the routine executes, alert(s) and a MailMan message are sent to 
 members of the "LMI" mail group as well as the user who manually invoked
 the option "Missing AP Alert Search". Recipients of the alerts and MailMan
 messages will then determine whether to manually generate an alert for the
 cases using the already existing option "Send an AP Alert" which is under
 the menu "Verify/release menu, anat path".
  
 If no issues are found, an alert and MailMan message are generated 
 indicating "No issues found".
  
 TaskMan Execution:
 ----------------- 
  
 If the option is executed by TaskMan, alert(s) and a MailMan message are
 sent ONLY to members of the "LMI" MailMan group and ONLY if issues are
 found.  
  
 Only "new" verified Anatomic Pathology cases with missing alerts and/or
 related issues will be included in the MailMan messages each time the
 option is invoked.  This enables the recipients to quickly ascertain which
 cases need attention.  The ending date/time when the search option last 
 finished is stored in the parameter "LR AP ALERT SEARCH END".  
  
 Manually invoking option "Missing AP Alert Search" will not affect the
 parameter setting.  The parameter is only referred to and set by TaskMan
 execution.

    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   Install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
       NOTE: Since the routine in this patch is new, there should be no    
             routines to back up.  However, it's a good idea to back up 
             anyway in case a routine with the same name unexpectedly
             happens to reside on the system.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*504'.
  
       When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
       Install? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
       When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Installation Verification
 =========================
  
 1. Compare the checksum of the routine LRAPUALT to the "After" checksum
    listed in the patch description.
  
 2. Verify that the option "Missing AP Alert Search" is available under 
    the LRAPSUPER menu:
  
        AL     Missing AP Alert Search
  
 3. Perform a FileMan Inquiry on the PARAMETER DEFINITION (#8989.51) file 
    for "LR AP ALERT SEARCH END":
  
        VA FileMan 22.2
  
        Select OPTION: 5  INQUIRE TO FILE ENTRIES
  
        Output from what File: PARAMETER DEFINITION//   (1001 entries)
        Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME: LR AP ALERT SEARCH END
                                          LR AP Alert Search End Date/Time
        Another one: 
        Standard Captioned Output? Yes//   (Yes)
        Include COMPUTED fields:  (N/Y/R/B): NO// BOTH Computed Fields and
                                                  Record Number (IEN)
  
        NUMBER: 933                    NAME: LR AP ALERT SEARCH END
        DISPLAY TEXT: LR AP Alert Search End Date/Time
        MULTIPLE VALUED: No
        INSTANCE TERM: LR AP Alert Search End Date/Time
        VALUE TERM: LR AP Alert Search End Date/Time
        PROHIBIT EDITING: No              VALUE DATA TYPE: date/time
        VALUE DOMAIN: ::T
        VALUE HELP: This value equals the last time that TaskMan ran option
                    Missing AP Alert Search.                          
        INSTANCE DATA TYPE: date/time     INSTANCE DOMAIN: ::T
        DESCRIPTION:   
        This parameter only applies to a search initiated by Taskman when
        the option "Missing AP Alert Search" is defined to run 
        automatically in TaskMan.  Users may manually run the search using
        the option "Missing AP Alert Search" without affecting the
        date/time set in this parameter.
   
        The value for this parameter equals the last date/time that was
        searched in order to find verified Anatomic Pathology cases which
        did not have an alert generated.  Some sites are finding that
        alerts do not generate at times.  The issue cannot be reproduced at
        will.  A suspected cause is that a session is disconnected after
        verification but before the alert is queued.
        PRECEDENCE: 1                      ENTITY FILE: SYSTEM
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
  
 1. Verify there is at least one member in the mail group LMI.  It is 
 recommended that the LIM and at least one other person be a member of 
 this group.
  
 2. Use the option Schedule/Unschedule Options (XUTM SCHEDULE) to schedule 
 the option Missing AP Alert Search (LRAPALERT) to run DAILY. 
  
  
 Back-out Procedures
 ===================
  
 Option:
 ------
  
 The option "Missing AP Alert Search" can be removed from the LRAPSUPER
 menu through FileMan.
  
 1. Make sure the option has not been scheduled in TaskMan.  If it has, 
    delete the TaskMan entry following established protocols for your site.
  
 2. Delete the option as an item under the LRAPSUPER menu:
  
        VA FileMan 22.2
  
        Select OPTION: 1  ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES
  
        Input to what File: OPTION//              (13653 entries)
        EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// MENU
        1   MENU    (multiple)
        2   MENU TEXT  
        CHOOSE 1-2: 1  MENU  (multiple)
        EDIT WHICH MENU SUB-FIELD: ALL// ITEM  
        THEN EDIT MENU SUB-FIELD: 
        THEN EDIT FIELD: 
  
        Select OPTION NAME: LRAPSUPER       Supervisor, anat path
        Select ITEM: LRAPALERT// @
        SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THE ENTIRE ITEM? Y  (Yes)
        Select ITEM: LRAP ESIG SWITCH// ^
  
 3. Delete the option:
  
        VA FileMan 22.2
  
        Select OPTION: 1  ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES
  
        Input to what File: OPTION//              (13653 entries)
        EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// 
  
        Select OPTION NAME: LRAPALERT       Missing AP Alert Search
        NAME: LRAPALERT// @
        SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THE ENTIRE 'LRAPALERT' OPTION? Y  (Yes)
        SINCE THE DELETED ENTRY MAY HAVE BEEN 'POINTED TO'
        BY ENTRIES IN THE 'AUDIT' FILE, ETC.,
        DO YOU WANT THOSE POINTERS UPDATED (WHICH COULD TAKE QUITE A
        WHILE)? No// (No)
  
 Routine:
 -------
  
 The routine LRAPUALT may be deleted using the Delete Routines option 
 under the Programmer Options menu:
  
 Select Routine Tools <TEST ACCOUNT> Option: DELETE Routines
  
 ROUTINE DELETE
  
 All Routines? No => No
  
 Routine: LRAPUALT
 Routine: 
 1 routine
  
 1 routines to DELETE, OK: NO// YES
  
 Use this option cautiously so as to not accidentally delete a routine 
 which is needed due to a typo when specifying the routine.  It does not 
 cause harm to keep the routine on the system since the option has been 
 deleted.
  
 Parameter Definition:
 --------------------
  
 Deleting the PARAMETER DEFINITION (#8989.51) file entry of "LR AP ALERT 
 SEARCH END" is not recommended.  Cross-references may exist in other VistA
 files, and the downstream effects of possible remaining cross references 
 are unknown.
  
 There is no harm in allowing the PARAMETER DEFINITION (#8989.51) file 
 entry of "LR AP ALERT SEARCH END" to remain on the system.  Instead, the 
 FileMan description field could be edited to state that the parameter 
 definition is not used.
