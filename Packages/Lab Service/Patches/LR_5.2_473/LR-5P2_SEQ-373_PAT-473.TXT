 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1. I8246369FY16 - Incomplete autopsy log-in
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the log-in process of an autopsy accession is aborted at the "AUTOPSY
 DATE/TIME:" prompt, a stub entry is erroneously left in the ACCESSION 
 file (#68) for the new accession number that was being created but
 subsequently aborted. The cleanup of the aborted log-in is incomplete.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine LRAUAW to complete the cleanup process of ACCESSION 
 file (#68) when the log-in of an autopsy accession is aborted.
  
 Routines: LRAUAW
  
 2. I6575449FY16 - <UNDEFINED> error in micro results entry (batch)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If auditing is turned on for the BACT RPT REMARK field (#13) of the
 MICROBIOLOGY subfile (#63.05) of the LAB DATA file (#63) and the option
 "Results entry (batch)" [LRMISTUF] is used to enter micro results, an
 <UNDEFINED> error occurs.
     
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine LRMISTF1 to set the DA(1) variable at linetag STUFF+18
 before the call to FileMan routine ^DIE.    
     
 Routine: LRMISTF1
