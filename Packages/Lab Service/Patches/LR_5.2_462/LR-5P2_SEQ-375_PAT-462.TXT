Subject: ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY ORDER DIALOG ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Associated Patches: LR*5.2*469
  
  
 The build for this patch is distributed in support of the VistA Lab 
 Enhancement (VLE) Anatomic Pathology order dialog enhancements. It
 contains a modification to the LABORATORY TEST (#60), LAB ORDER ENTRY
 (#69), LABORATORY SITE (#69.9) and adds the new file LR CPRS PARAMETERS
 (#69.71).
  
 1- Anatomic Pathology specimen log-in option has been modified to 
 prompt the user for an order number. This order number will be created 
 by CPRS when the new Anatomic Pathology ordering functionality is 
 available and enabled.
 2- If a user enters an order number, the process deviates from the 
 current Log-in,anat path option in that it displays any data entered via
 CPRS AP order dialog. The fields presented could include any of the
 following:
    a.      SURGEON/PHYSICIAN
    b.      SPECIMEN SUBMITTED BY
    c.      SPECIMEN DESCRIPTION/SPECIMEN (multiple)
    d.      BRIEF CLINICAL DESCRIPTION
    e.      PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
    f.      OPERATIVE FINDINGS
    g.      POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
 3- If Surgical Case(s) are found for this patient in the last 7 days 
 they will be presented to the user for selection. If a case is selected 
 the data from the Surgical Case will be displayed and the user will be 
 asked if they wish to include this in the appropriate field in the 
 Anatomic Pathology accession.
 4- If Surgical Case information is added to Anatomic Pathology 
 fields it will display first and followed by the information obtained 
 from the CPRS order.
 5- All other data entry/edit actions will be done via existing 
 Anatomic Pathology options.
  
  
 Blood Bank Review:
 ==================
 All of the above changes have been reviewed by the VISTA Blood Bank 
 Developer and found to have no impact on the VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE 
 control functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*462 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SITES: This patch contains changes to routines and 
 files identified in ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA 
 Patches, group B listing. The changes have no effect on Blood Bank 
 functionality or medical device control functions. There is no adverse 
 potential to sites.

 New Service Requests (NSRs):
 ----------------------------   
 #20140511
 The Anatomic Pathology (AP) laboratory service needs a mechanism for 
 clinicians to provide required patient-specific, procedure-specific, and 
 specimen-specific information to facilitate specimen processing by 
 pathologists. This mechanism must be in place for use by the specimen 
 labeling application in order to generate a primary specimen label that 
 positively identifies the specimen and accurately associates it with the 
 patient.
