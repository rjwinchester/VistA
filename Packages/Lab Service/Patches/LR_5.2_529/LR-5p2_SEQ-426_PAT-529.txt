 INC5439465 - Lab Frequency Order Checks
  
 (Ticket INC5439361 is also included in OR*3.0*510 but did not require 
 updates to the Laboratory Data Dictionary and to Laboratory 
 documentation.)
  
 VistA ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING patch OR*3*510 addresses the 
 following:
  
  
    1. Modify routine ORKLR2 to perform maximum frequency order checks
       against the collection date/time of Lab orders.
    2. Clarify the "Help Prompt" and "Description" fields for the MAX. 
       ORDER FREQ. (#4) and SINGLE DAY MAX ORDER FREQ (#4.5) fields of the 
       COLLECTION SAMPLE SUB-FIELD (#60.03) sub-file of the LABORATORY TEST
       (#60) file.
    3. Add further explanations to the Laboratory Planning Implementation
       Guide (PIG) Version 5.2 pertaining to order check functionality on
       frequency-related fields. 
    4. Add clarification to the CPRS Setup Guide that order checks may 
       occur for "frequency" as defined in the LABORATORY TEST (#60) file
       in addition to duplicate order checks.

 ========================
  
 60.03,4   MAX. ORDER FREQ.  0;5 NUMBER
  
           INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>120)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1N.N) X
           LAST EDITED:      AUG 28, 1989 
           HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 1 and 120, 0 Decimal
                             Digits   --  This test may only be ordered
                             once within this number of day(s).
           DESCRIPTION:      Use this field to control how often a test may
                             be ordered within a certain time period (# of
                             days). The entry will then force the system to
                             remind the ordering person that the order they
                             are placing for this test exceeds the maximum
                             order frequency.  If you enter 3, the test may
                             only be ordered once every three days.

           LAST EDITED:      AUG 28, 1989 
           HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Number between 1 and 50, 0 Decimal 
                             Digits  --  Enter the number of times this
                             test may be ordered in one day.
           DESCRIPTION:      Enter a number specifying the maximum number
                             of times a test can be ordered in a single
                             day.  
  
 Data Dictionaries After:
 =======================
  
 60.03,4   MAX. ORDER FREQ.  0;5 NUMBER
  
           INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>120)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1.N) X
           LAST EDITED:      MAY 21, 2019 
           HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the timeframe in number of days (between
                             1 and 120) that the test should be ordered to
                             be collected only once.
           DESCRIPTION:      Use this field to control how often a test may
                             be ordered to be collected within a certain
                             time period (# of days). If you enter "3", the
                             test should only be ordered to be collected
                             once every three days. The entry will then 
                             force CPRS to remind the ordering person that
                             the order being placed for this test exceeds
                             the maximum order frequency.

          ORDER FREQ 
  
           INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:+X'=X!(X>50)!(X<1)!(X?.E1"."1.N) X
           LAST EDITED:      MAY 21, 2019 
           HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the maximum number of times (between 1
                             and 50) that a test should be ordered to be
                             collected on a single day. 
           DESCRIPTION:      If this test should not be ordered to be
                             collected more than a certain number of times
                             per day, enter a number (between 1 and 50)
                             specifying the maximum frequency per day. The 
                             entry will then cause CPRS to remind the
                             ordering person that the order being placed
                             for this test exceeds the "single day maximum
                             frequency" for the specified collection date.
