Associated patches: (v)LR*5.2*459  <<= must be installed BEFORE `LR*5.2*507'

Subject: LAB PANEL DISPLAYS INCORRECTLY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issue:
  
 When a lab panel (cosmic) test is set up so the atomic tests in the panel
 split to separate accession areas (e.g. one Chemistry and one Toxicology),
 results of the ordered panel test do not display all of the results of the
 atomic tests in the panel when viewed in Computerized Patient Record
 System (CPRS) from the Orders tab or from the Cover Sheet.
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. CA-SDM I19238962FY18 - Lab Panel Displays Incorrectly
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When there are two accessions created during the accessioning process, the
 date.time value used to store data about the tests in the LAB DATA file
 (#63) can be slightly different (e.g. 6819595.864069 and 6819595.86407).
 Only one date.time value is stored in the ORDER file (#100). Invariably, a
 $ORDER based on those parameters will exceed the end date (or be beyond
 the start date) after the first pass and then it will QUIT. Consequently,
 only one set of results will be returned.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine ^LR7OR1 is modified to initiate the search in the LAB DATA 
 file (#63) with a date.time value slightly lower than the value stored in
 the ORDER file (#100).
  
  
 Blood Bank Clearance:
 ---------------------
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*507 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*507 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*507 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system. The 
 install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
 problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option to load the KIDS patch
    into a Transport Global on your system.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System Menu (KIDS), select
    the Installation Menu.
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select the Backup a Transport Global 
    option and when prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch
    LR*5.2*507. This option will create a backup message of any routines
    exported with this patch. It will not backup any other changes such as
    DDs or templates.
     
 5. From the Installation Menu, you may elect to use the following options.
    When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch LR*5.2*507.
  
     a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
     
     b. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to print only 
        a summary of the patch, to print a summary of the patch and the
        routines in the transport global, or to print only the routines in
        the transport global.
  
     c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed. (It compares all components of this patch's routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
 6. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    enter the patch LR*5.2*507.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//', 
    respond 'NO'.
  
 8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? NO//', respond 'NO'.
  
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility Chief Information 
 Officer may make the decision to back-out the patch.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The PackMan
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum matches
 the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
