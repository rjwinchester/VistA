Subject: MICROBIOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch is the mechanism that will be used now and anytime in the 
 future to nationally transfer and add new Carbapenem-Resistant
 Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) organisms into the Etiology Field file, (#61.2).
 This step will automatically update each facility with these
 microbiology enhancements and other Multi-Drug resistant Organisms (MDRO) 
 standardized reporting and eliminate the need for each individual lab to 
 update its own local files manually.

 Patch installation needs to be coordinated with the Laboratory 
 Information Manager (LIM/ADPAC) at each site for the following entries in 
 the Etiology Field File, (#61.2).
  
         KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE, CARBAPENEM RESISTANT (CRE)
         KLEBSIELLA OXYTOCA, CARBAPENEM RESISTANT (CRE
         ESCHERICHIA COLI, CARBAPENEM RESISTANT (CRE)

 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
 install it during non-peak hours. This patch is released as a Packman 
 message. 
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.  
   
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
 problems loading and/or installing this patch.
    
 1.      Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the Packman menu. This 
 option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
 2.      The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your 
 system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
 3.      On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS), 
 select the 'Installation' menu.
  
 4.      Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify 
 that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
 5.      On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
 following options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
 If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch 
 prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' 
 option at this time. You may also compare the routines in your production 
 account to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare a Transport 
 Global to Current System' option.
  
 6.      Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
 and select the package 'LR*5.2*463'.
  
 When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//, 
 choose 'NO'. 
  
 When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
 Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
