Subject: LAB HOWDY DUPLICATE TEST DELETION ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two (2) VistA Laboratory issues related to the 
 deletion of Howdy duplicate test orders:
  
 1.  Duplicate test is deleted in VistA but active in CPRS
 2.  Error occurs when specimen numbers have more than one duplicate test

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
  
 1.  I8474681FY16: Duplicate test deleted in VistA but active in CPRS
  
     Problem:
     -------
  
     A test will appear "active" in CPRS but "canceled" in VistA when the 
     following three conditions are met: (1) Two or more specimen numbers 
     in the LAB ORDER ENTRY (#69) file contain a duplicate test; (2) A
     duplicate test to be canceled is the last sequential (not numerical)
     test ordered for the specimen number in the LAB ORDER ENTRY (#69)
     file; and (3) Howdy accessioning cancels that duplicate test.
  
     Resolution:
     ----------
  
     Modify routine LRHYPH2 to not mark CPRS orders as "active".  The 
     logic is faulty for two reasons: (1) Howdy accessioning has already
     marked orders as "active" or "discontinued" correctly before routine
     LRHYPH2 is invoked; and (2) Routine LRHYPH2 is retrieving the order
     number to be marked active from an incorrect field of the LAB ORDER
     ENTRY (#69) file.
  
     Routine: LRHYPH2
  
 2.  I14780260FY17: Error occurs with more than one duplicate test
  
     Problem:
     -------
  
     If more than one test is duplicated between specimen numbers in the 
     Lab Order Entry (#69) FILE, an error will occur during the Howdy
     accessioning process.
  
     Resolution:
     ----------
  
     Modify routine LRHYB to check for variable LRORD before invoking the
     line which causes the error. A similar check for LRORD is performed on
     a line previous to the line which causes the error. Testing has proven
     that accessioning will then set all VistA files correctly.
  
     Routine: LRHYB
  
    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   Install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*491'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//, 
       choose 'NO'. 
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
