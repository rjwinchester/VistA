 Blood Bank Review:
 ==================
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*495 does not
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*495 does not
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*495 have no effect on Blood
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of
 installation of this patch.
  
 Description:
 NDS enhancement for the ETIOLGY file (#61.2) to add INACTIVE DATE and
 change the SNOMED extract to include the new INACTIVE DATE. Add two options
 that will allow the LIM and the Microbiology Supervisor to populate the new
 INACTIVE DATE field. Modify the deployment method for SNOMED updates from
 a patch FTP methodology to utilizing the standing Laboratory MailMan Server
 functions for files: TOPOGRAPHY FIELD File (#61), ETIOLOGY FIELD File
 (#61.2), and COLLECTION SAMPLE File (#62).
  
 The addition of the INACTIVE DATE field to the ETIOLOGY FIELD File (#61.2)
 will bring the file into accordance with the TOPOGRAPHY FIELD File (#61)
 and the COLLECTION SAMPLE File (#62), which already have an INACTIVE DATE
 field.
 By adding options to update the INACTIVE DATE field by the LIM and
 Microbiology Supervisor, the ETIOLOGY FIELD File (#61.2) will be
 positioned for future efforts to screen out inactive entries.
  
 There are two new VistA options exported with the patch. Both are locked 
 with the LRSUPER security key. These options have been added to the LIM 
 NDS MENU and to the Microbiology menu:
  
 Edit Inactive DT Multiple - ETIOLOGY File [LRMI EDIT INACT DT MULTI 61.2]
 Edit Inactive DT Single - ETIOLOGY File   [LRMI EDIT INACT DT SINGLE 61.2]
  
  
 The Edit Inactive DT Multiple-ETIOLOGY File allows the LIM or Microbiology
 Supervisor to enter the INACTIVE DATE for items that are now inactive. The
 Option will allow the person to select an IDENTIFER. If others had 
 previously reviewed entries for the selected IDENTIFIER, the option will ask
 the person if they wish to continue or to start over. If it is the first
 time, or if starting over, the option will start with the oldest entry working
 towards the newest entry. The option will display entries that do not have
 an INACTIVE date and are associated to the IDENTIFIER selected.
  
 The Edit Inactive DT Single-ETIOLOGY File allows the LIM or Microbiology
 Supervisor to enter, edit, or remove the INACTIVE DATE for the item that was
 Selected for edit.
  
 The current SNOMED extract will be modified to include the ETIOLOGY FIELD
 File (#61.2) INACTIVE DATE field. This will be in line with the TOPOGRAPHY
 FIELD File (#61) and the COLLECTION SAMPLE File (#62) which already report
 their respective INACTIVE DATEs.
 The current process for send SNOMED updates for the TOPOGRAPHY FIELD (#61),
 ETIOLOGY FIELD (#61.2), and COLLECTION SAMPLE (#62) files uses a patch
 process with the facilities having to FTP the SNOMED update file for
 processing. This has proven to be cumbersome and slow in deploying updates.
 By changing the method to use the standing Laboratory MailMan server side
 functions to send the SNOMED update file to the facilities the turn around
 time for the updates will be faster and more consistent. Once the update has
 been loaded at the facility a mailman message will be sent the facility's
 local G.LMI mailman group that the file has been loaded and is ready for
 processing.
