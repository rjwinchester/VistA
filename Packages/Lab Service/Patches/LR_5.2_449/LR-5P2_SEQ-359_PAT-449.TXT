Subject: SEARCH OPTIONS ISSUES AND EGFR SEX PROBLEM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following 3 issues:
  
 1. Time ignored in searching date/time period.
 2. Units can be wrong in Search options.
 3. EGRF issue related to patient sex.
  
 Blood Bank Review:
 ================== 
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*449 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*449 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*449 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC000001046770 -  Lab - Other - Search option criteria
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Option "Search for high/low values of a test" [LRSORA] allows for a
 date/time interval to be entered for the search but the time part is
 ignored when doing the search. Also search is done based on order date in
 file #69 (LAB ORDER ENTRY) thus sometimes displaying unexpected data.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modify routines LRSORA and LRSORA3 to incorporate the time aspect of the
 input parameters for the search and force the search to go through file
 #63 (LAB DATA) to yield more consistent results.
  
 Routines: LRSORA, LRSORA3   
  
 2. INC000001042520 -  Lab - CH - General: Search options units
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In search options "Search for high/low values of a test" [LRSORA], "Search
 for critical value flagged tests" [LRSORC], and "Search for abnormal and
 critical flagged tests" [LRSORD], the units displayed are pulled from the 
 LABORATORY TEST file (#60) rather than from the LAB DATA file (#63)
 where the test results are stored. If the units have been changed in the
 LABORATORY TEST file (#60), then the wrong units will show with the
 results for these searches.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modify these searches to get the units and reference ranges from the LAB 
 DATA file (#63) where they are stored with the test results.
     
 Routines: LRSORA2, LRSORA3, LRSORC1, LRSORC1A, LRSORD1, LRSORD1A
  
 3. INC000001033783 -  EGFR issue related to patient sex
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Delta checks for the test EGFR do not pull the sex for patients in the 
 RESEARCH file (#67.1). This often leads to the test being cancelled.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modify delta check routines LREGFR and LREGFR2 to obtain the sex of the
 patient from the RESEARCH file (#67.1) when the patient is a research
 patient.
  
 Routines: LREGFR, LREGFR2 
  
   ==================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
   1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
      select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
      that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
      If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
      patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
      Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
      your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
      'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
   6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
      and select the package 'LR*5.2*449.
  
      If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
      choose 'NO'.
  
      If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
