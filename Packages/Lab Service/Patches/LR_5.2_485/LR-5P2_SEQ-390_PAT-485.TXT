 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1) I13556053FY17: Multiple orders associated with one Anatomic Pathology
                   accession
  
 Problem 1:
 ---------
 If a user edits log-in information for an Anatomic Pathology order in the
 Log-In menu instead of the Edit menu, multiple orders are created and
 linked to one Anatomic Pathology accession.  This creates a confusing view
 in CPRS, and the duplicate order must be manually cancelled. There should
 only be one order linked to an Anatomic Pathology accession.
  
 Resolution 1:
 ------------
  
 Modify routine LRAPLG1 to not allow edits to an order in the Log-in, anat
 path [LRAPLG] option if the accession has already been created.  Alert the
 user that the edit must be done in the Edit/modify data, anat path [LRAPE]
 option.

    options:
            Print Transport Global
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Backup a Transport Global
  
    If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
    patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
    Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
    your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
    'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
 6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
    and select the package 'LR*5.2*485'.
