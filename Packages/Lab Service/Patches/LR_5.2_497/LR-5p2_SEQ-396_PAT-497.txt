 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*497 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*497 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 R15083145FY17: Interim Report Option Description and User Manual Updates
  
 Problem:
 -------
   
 This ticket addresses options "Interim reports by location (manual queue)"
 and "Interim reports for 1 location (manual queue)". When one or more 
 ordering locations are specified for the report, all verified results
 ordered under all locations for the patients that have had orders placed
 under the specified locations will print. It was determined that this is
 a desired outcome.  However, the option descriptions and VistA Laboratory
 documentation should be updated to clarify the contents of the interim
 reports when invoking these two options.
    
 Resolution: 
 ----------
  
 Add clarification to the option descriptions for the options "Interim 
 reports by location (manual queue)" and "Interim reports for 1 location 
 (manual queue)". Add corresponding clarifications also to the VistA
 Laboratory User Manual Version 5.2 and to the VistA Laboratory Planning 
 Implementation Guide Version 5.2.

   TYPE: run routine                     
   PACKAGE: LAB SERVICE
  DESCRIPTION:   Detailed report format for all data for one day sorted by
  location.  This option is an alternative to having the Interim report 
  tasked to the taskmanager.  For tasking, see option LRTASK DAILY INTERIM
  1.  If no results are available for a location, the option will print out
  the location heading followed by the next location heading.  This option
  will only print verified results, is not part of the cumulative report
  and should not be charted.  The date chosen for this report is the
  collection date.  If a test is ordered on one day and verified on the
  next day, you must select the order date to see the report with this
  option.  The report prints site codes for tests.  You will be asked if
  you would like to print an address page.  The address page prints on a
  separate page(s) at the end of the report and lists the performing lab
  name, address and site code.

   PACKAGE: LAB SERVICE
  DESCRIPTION:   Detailed report format of all verified results for 
  specified collection dates and ordering locations sorted by location. The
  report prints according to the ordering location, not the patient's
  current location.  
   
  Each patient's verified results for orders placed under the specified 
  location(s) as well as for orders placed under other locations on the 
  specified collection date(s) will print so as to provide complete 
  laboratory information on the patient. (Patients who do not have orders
  placed under the specified location(s) will not be printed.) The date
  chosen for this report is the collection date.  If a test is collected on
  one day and verified on the next day, you must select the collection
  date.  
   
  The report prints site codes for tests.  You will be asked if you would 
  like to print an address page.  The address page prints on a separate
  page at the end of the report and lists the performing lab name, address
  and site code.
   
  This option is an alternative to having the Interim report tasked.  For 
  tasking, see option LRTASK DAILY INTERIM 1. If no results are available 
  for a location, the option will print out the location heading followed
  by the next location heading. This option is not part of the cumulative
  report and should not be charted.
