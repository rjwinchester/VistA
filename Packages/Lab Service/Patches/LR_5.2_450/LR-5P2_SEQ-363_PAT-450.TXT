Subject: AP DELETE ACCESSION, ORDERED TESTS BY PHYSICIAN & CANCELED VBECS ACCESSIONED

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses three (3) issues:
 1. The Anatomic Pathology option, DELETE ACCESSION #, ANAT PATH
    [LRAPKILL], gives the user ambiguous feedback about whether the delete
    of the accession was successful.
 2. The ORDERED TEST COST BY PROVIDER [LR ORDERED TESTS BY PHY] option 
    misses AP and Howdy tests when an Accessioning Division is specified.
 3. Orders generated in CPRS and rejected in VBECS can be accessioned
    in VistA Lab.

 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*450 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC000000927637 - AP Delete Accession
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Under certain conditions, when using the Anatomic Pathology option 
 DELETE ACCESSION #, ANAT PATH [LRAPKILL], after the user responds "Y"
 to an "OK to DELETE" prompt, the application displays "??" even 
 though the delete is successful.  When that occurs, the CANCELED BY 
 FIELD (#10) in the LAB ORDER ENTRY FILE (#69) is not populated (or 
 is set to zero). The defect occurs because the program is attempting
 to update the CANCELED BY FIELD (#10) with the user's DUZ (an internal 
 format) using an option of a FileMan API (^DIE) that expects an 
 external format.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The patch modifies the way the routine ^LRUDEL uses the FileMan API 
 ^DIE.  The modification uses the Stuff a Field Value (Un-validated) 
 option of ^DIE which expects the Internal Entry Number (IEN) for the
 user that performed the cancel.
  
 Routines: LRUDEL
  
 2. INC000000963117 - Ordered Tests by Physician
   
 Problem:
 --------
 The ORDERED TESTS COST BY PROVIDER [LR ORDERED TESTS BY PHY] option
 generates a report that misses tests ordered via AP or HOWDY when an
 Accessioning Division is specified (rather than selecting all
 divisions).  This occurs because those options do not populate the
 INSTITUTION FIELD (#25) in the LAB ORDER ENTRY FILE (#69).  Running the
 report for all divisions generates an accurate report because the
 INSTITUTION FIELD (#25) is not examined when no Accessioning Division is
 specified.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A modification to routine LRHYPH2, corrects the issue for HOWDY for 
 future orders. A modification to routine LR7OFAO, corrects the issue
 for AP for future orders. Further, the patch Post Install Routine 
 (LR450PIR) uses the ORDERING LOCATION FIELD (#23) when it is defined
 to look up the INSTITUTION and correctly populate the field in the 
 LAB ORDER ENTRY FILE (#69).
  
 Routines: LR7OFAO, LRHYPH2
  
 3. INC000001037305 - Canceled VBECS Accessioned
   
 Problem:
 --------
 Orders that are rejected by VBECS can be accessioned and show as 
 'Pending' in Order/test status. It has been discovered that VBECS does
 not include the DUZ of the person rejecting the order in the order 
 reject message to CPRS.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The patch modifies code in routines ^LROE and ^LROS to check the 
 STATUS FIELD (#8) along with the CANCELED BY FIELD (#10) of the TEST
 multiple (#6) of the SPECIMEN # multiple (#1) in the LAB ORDER ENTRY
 FILE (#69) during Accessioning (LROE) and displaying Order/test 
 status (LROS).

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 10 minutes. This patch 
 can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
       problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
 1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
    option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
 2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
    system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
 3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
    select the 'Installation' menu.
  
 4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
    that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
 5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
    following options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
    To preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch prior
    to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' 
    option at this time. You may also compare the routines in your 
    production account to the routines in the patch by using the 
    'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
 6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' 
    menu and select the package 'LR*5.2*450'.
  
    When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
    YES//, choose 'NO'.
  
    When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
    and Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
  
 7. The Post Install Routine will run and display progress during 
    the install.
