Subject: ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY LOG-IN: SCREEN FOR SEX-SPECIFIC TOPOGRAPHY

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issue:
  
 Anatomic Pathology Log-In does not require that the patient's sex must 
 match the SEX SPECIFIC (#2.5) field in the TOPOGRAPHY FIELD (#61) file for
 specimens (if the sex specific field is defined).

 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*514 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*514 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*514 have no adverse effect on 
 Blood Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
 1. INC2906846 - Anatomic Pathology Log-In Sex-Specific Topography
                 Validation
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The Log-in, anat path [LRAPLG] option does not require that the patient's
 sex must match any sex-specific specimen topography specimens. These
 specimens correspond to an entry from the TOPOGRAPHY FIELD (#61) file that
 is defined with "F" for "female" or "M" for "male" in the SEX SPECIFIC
 (#2.5) field. If a specimen is logged in with a sex-specific mismatch,
 that entry is not accepted during the later steps in Anatomic Pathology
 Data Entry.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modify the data dictionary input transforms and screens for the Surgical 
 Pathology, Cytopathology, and Electron Microscopy (EM) accession areas
 with the following requirement: If the SEX SPECIFIC (#2.5) field of the
 TOPOGRAPHY FIELD (#61) file is defined, the patient's sex must match the
 field entry.
  
 Any entries in the TOPOGRAPHY FIELD (#61) file that have an "M" or "F"
 entry in the SEX SPECIFIC (#2.5) field will not display to the user as a
 selection choice if the entry is not the same as the patient's sex.
  
 NOTE: This change is not necessary for the Autopsy accession area since 
 specimen topography is not entered during the Log-in, anat path [LRAPLG]
 option. The change will also not be implemented for Laboratory accession
 areas not related to Anatomic Pathology.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 =============================
 This patch may be loaded with users on the system. You may wish to 
 install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
 minute. 
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
 problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
    2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This

    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. From this menu, you may elect to use the following option. When 
       prompted for the INSTALL NAME select the package 'LR*5.2*514':
  
       a. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to print 
          only a summary of the patch, to print a summary of the patch and
          the routines in the transport global, or to print only the
          routines in the transport global.
  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
       
    5. Backup: The KIDS menu option "Backup a Transport Global" will not be
       used to back this patch up since no routines are included.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*514'.
  
    7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
    8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
       and Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Installation Verification:
 =========================

 example below illustrates the Cytopathology sub-file.  The steps may be 
 repeated for the EM and Surgical Pathology sub-files.
