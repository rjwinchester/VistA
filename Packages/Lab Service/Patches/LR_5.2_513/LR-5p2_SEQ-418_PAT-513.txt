 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  1.  Defect 848632 (SN INC2778111- Problem with option Results entry (batch)
 [LRMISTUF])
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The problem reported is that when using option Microbiology Results entry
 (batch), for a test using the TB BACTERIOLOGY execute code, a prompt for
 PRELIMINARY BACT COMMENT is displayed in addition to instead of the prompt for
 PRELIMINARY TB COMMENT.  This occurs if the user enters a partial response such
 as: "PREL" at the "Enter the field to edit" prompt.  This was found to be a 
 parsing problem and therefore this problem may exist for more than just the TB 
 BACTERIOLOGY execute code reported by the user.   It was found that the 
 EXECUTE CODE (#62.07) file defined for the test LAB files (File#60) was not 
 being parsed correctly which lead to an incorrect prompt being displayed.  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modify routine LRMISTF to correctly parse out the correct pointers from File
 #62.07.  The problem was that the parsing code was looking at codes that it
 should not have been, past where the codes were listed in a string beginning
 with 'DR=' which was followed by a semi-colon delimited string of the codes. 
 After those code there was in some instances additional data in the string. 
 That additional data was viewed for valid codes.  The changes with this patch
 modifies it to only view the valid code in the DR= part of the string.

         options.  When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch LR*5.2*513
          
              a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
                 message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
                 backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
              b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
                 (allow you to view all changes that will be made when this 
                 patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch 
                 routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
              c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
                 you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 -------------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions
