Subject: HOWDY ISSUES WITH EXCLUDED CLINICS, DELETION OF SAME DAY DUPLICATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses four (4) issues:
   
  1. The "deletion" part of the DELETE SAME DAY DUPLICATES functionality 
     in the Howdy processing is tasked, and does not fully complete in time
     to prevent duplicate tests from being accessioned and marked as
     "Active" in CPRS.
   
  2. Repeated, unnecessary N(EW)ing of variables coupled with GOTO logic 
     can lead to an unresponsive terminal session due to system 
     parameters in Cache.
   
  3. Howdy: DELETE SAME DAY DUPLICATES problem
   
  4. Orders placed from an EXCLUDED CLINIC location (EXLOC) should only 
     be accessioned if scanned (LRHY PATIENT CARD SCAN) on the collection
     date of the order. If the collection date is other than TODAY (date of
     the card scan), these orders should not be accessioned.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1. INC000000599573 - DELETE SAME DAY DUPLICATES not working
    
    Problem:
    --------
    The "deletion" part of the DELETE SAME DAY DUPLICATES functionality in
    Howdy processing is tasked and does not fully complete in time to
    prevent these duplicate tests from being accessioned and marked as
    "Active" in CPRS.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRHYA to add a H(ANG) 5 after the deletion task is
    initiated in order to allow enough time for the deletion process to
    complete before the accessioning process begins. 
     
    Routine: LRHYA
  
 2. INC000000616610 - Howdy: Card scanning/manual SSN input issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Repeated, unnecessary N(EW)ing of variables coupled with GOTO logic can
    lead to an unresponsive terminal session due to system parameters in
    Cache.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify GOTO logic to GO to a label after the N(EW)ing to prevent stack
    overload.
  
    Routines: LRHY0, LRHY01  
  
  
  
 3. INC000000879395 - Howdy: DELETE SAME DAY DUPLICATES problem
  
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO # 2627
  
    Problem:
    --------
    If the field DELETE SAME DAY DUPLICATES (#52) in the HOWDY SITE FILE
    (#69.86) is set to YES and there are orders from different providers,
    for the same date, AND with the same collection sample, the order from
    the second provider is "merged" with the order from first ordering
    provider. If one of the orders is a duplicate order, when the Howdy
    Scan Patient Card option is used, the order on the file 69 node that is
    "merged from" is being shown as cancelled, but the order on the file 69
    node that the order was "merged to" is accessioned. There is only one
    duplicate test that should be cancelled, but all tests that were merged
    (same collection sample) are being shown as cancelled on the original
    node in file 69, even though they were NOT cancelled.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRHYA such that only the duplicate test is marked as
    cancelled and other tests with the same collection sample that should
    be accessioned are accessioned when orders are merged in this
    situation.
  
    Routine: LRHYA
  
 4. INC000000843758 - Lab - Howdy: Excluded Clinics malfunction
  
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO # 2628
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Orders placed from an EXCLUDED CLINIC location (EXLOC) should only be
    accessioned if scanned (LRHY PATIENT CARD SCAN) on the collection date
    of the order. If the collection date is other than TODAY (date of the
    card scan), these orders should not be accessioned. There are several
    scenarios where this is not happening or where other tests from
    non-excluded clinics are not handled properly when accompanied by tests
    from excluded clinics. 
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routines LRHY0, LRHY01, LRHYA, LRHYB, and LRHYPH0 to handle the
    identified scenarios properly with respect to the excluded clinic
    functionality.
     
    Routine: LRHY0, LRHY01, LRHYA, LRHYB, LRHYPH0

    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
    can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
          problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*457.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
