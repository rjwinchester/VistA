Subject: CPRS LAB TEST ERROR AFTER SPECIMEN DELETION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following VistA Lab Service issue:
  
 An <UNDEFINED> error occurs in CPRS when ordering a lab test that has had
 a SITE/SPECIMEN deleted in the LABORATORY TEST file (#60).
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
 1. INC3909862 - Error when ordering lab test after specimen deletion 
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The following error occurs in CPRS when ordering a lab test that has had 
 a SITE/SPECIMEN deleted in LABORATORY TEST file (#60):
 $ZE= <UNDEFINED>COLL+10^LR7OR3 ^LAB(60,lab_test_IEN,1,site/specimen_IEN,0)
  
 Resolution: 
 ----------
 Routine LRMLED has been modified to prevent the <UNDEFINED> error from 
 occurring. Specifically, the API ES^LRMLED has been modified to bypass
 continued processing if the following zero node entry does not exist for
 a lab test: ^LAB(60,'lab test ien',1,'site/specimen ien',0))
 Also, post-install routine LR517 has been created to clean up the 
 orphaned data that was causing the <UNDEFINED> error prior to this patch 
 being installed.
  
 Note: An entry in the SITE/SPECIMEN multiple of a test in the LABORATORY
 TEST file (#60) should NEVER be deleted. If a specimen was added in error,
 or if the specimen is no longer used, the field RESULT/SPECIMEN INACTIVE
 DATE should be used, and a date entered to mark the specimen as inactive.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post-Installation Overview:
 ------------------------------
 The post-install routine is LR517. This routine will remove any orphaned
 data in the LABORATORY TEST file (#60) that was causing the error prior to
 this patch install. Prior to being removed, the data will be backed up to
 ^XTMP("LR_5.2_517_POST_INSTALL") and stored for 30 days. This routine will
 also create and send a MailMan message with the subject - LR*5.2*517 Data
 Removal - to the patch installer that details the orphaned data that was
 removed.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 -----------------------------
 This patch may be loaded with users on the system. You may wish to install
 it during non-peak hours. Installation along with the execution of the
 post-install routine will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
 problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option to load the KIDS patch
    into a Transport Global on your system.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System Menu (KIDS), select
    the Installation Menu.
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select the Backup a Transport Global
    option and when prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch
    LR*5.2*517. This option will create a backup message of any routines
    exported with this patch. It will not backup any other changes such as
    DDs or templates.
     
 5. From the Installation Menu, you may elect to use the following options.
    When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch LR*5.2*517.
  
     a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
     
     b. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to print only 
        a summary of the patch, to print a summary of the patch and the
        routines in the transport global, or to print only the routines in
        the transport global.
  
     c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed. (It compares all components of this patch's routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
 6. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    enter the patch LR*5.2*517.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//', 
    respond 'NO'.
  
 8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? NO//', respond 'NO'.
  
 Installation Verification:
 -------------------------
 The Calculate and Show Checksum Values option [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run 
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in this patch 
 description.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from this patch description.
