Associated patches: (v)LR*5.2*476  <<= must be installed BEFORE `LR*5.2*508'

Subject: REMOVAL OF OBSOLETE FIELD AND SPECIMEN IN EXECUTE CODE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch LR*5.2*508 corrects references to one obsolete field and one 
 specimen found in the EXECUTE CODE file (#62.07) for Mycology and 
 Bacteriology. The obsolete references were discovered after the release of
 LR*5.2*476.
  
 For Mycology, field #19.2 listed in the EXECUTE CODE field (#1) is 
 not defined in the LAB DATA file (#63) and is deleted. For Bacteriology,
 specimen #68 from the TOPOGRAPHY FIELD file (#61) was previously
 referenced in the EXECUTE CODE field (#1) with the expression LRSPEC=68.
 This reference is changed to LRSPEC=360 to reflect specimen #360 from the
 TOPOGRAPHY FIELD file (#61). 
  
 This patch also updates the DESCRIPTION field (#6) in the EXECUTE CODE 
 file (#62.07) with new national definitions for Bacteriology, Mycology, 
 and TB Bacteriology entries. The national definitions are updated to 
 include the sub-fields PRELIMINARY BACT COMMENT (#1), PRELIMINARY 
 MYCOLOGY COMMENT (#20.5), and PRELIMINARY TB COMMENT (#26.5). These 
 sub-fields originate from the MICROBIOLOGY multiple field (#5) defined in 
 the LAB DATA file (#63).
  
 Post-installation routine LR52P508 makes the edits to the EXECUTE CODE 
 field (#1) for Bacteriology and Mycology records. This routine also 
 updates the DESCRIPTION field (#6) with new national definitions for 
 Bacteriology, Mycology, and TB Bacteriology entries. Upon completion of 
 patch installation, the routine is deleted automatically.
  
 Routine LRMISTF is modified to reference the preliminary comment fields 
 for Bacteriology, Mycology, and TB Bacteriology, along with corresponding 
 expansion codes. This enables predefined messages from the LAB 
 DESCRIPTIONS file (#62.5) to appear when the user runs the Results Entry 
 (Batch) option.
  
 Note to sites: Office of Information and Technology (OIT) personnel can
 retrieve the installation log for this patch by using the Install
 File Print [XPD PRINT INSTALL FILE] option in the UTILITIES submenu of
 KIDS. If any local changes were saved when this patch was installed, they
 must be restored manually after installation of the patch.

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 Verify that the execute codes for Mycology and Bacteriology have been
 updated by doing a FileMan inquiry of the EXECUTE CODE file (#62.07) and
 then reviewing the MUMPS code in the EXECUTE CODE field (#1). For
 Mycology, field #19.2 should no longer be available. For Bacteriology, the
 reference to specimen #68 with the expression LRSPEC=68 should now read
 LRSPEC=360.
  
 OIT personnel can retrieve the installation log for this patch by using

 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option. The message containing the 
 backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at 
 the Message Action prompt. The PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE is 
 then used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA system.
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the LR routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the LR routines have been backed
 out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain the
 designation of patch LR*5.2*508 on line 2 in the patch list section.
