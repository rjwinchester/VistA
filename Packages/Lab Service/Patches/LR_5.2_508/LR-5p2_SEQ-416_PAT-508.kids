This patch will update the DESCRIPTION field (#6) in file #62.07 with the
"BLD",10637,1,2,0)
Preliminary Comments field for Bacteriology, TB Bacteriology, and
"BLD",10637,1,3,0)
Mycology.
"BLD",10637,1,4,0)
Also, it will clean up obsolete codes in the EXECUTE CODE field #1 of
"BLD",10637,1,5,0)
the EXECUTE CODE file (#62.07), that were discovered after the release of
"BLD",10637,1,6,0)
LR*5.2*476. The obsolete execute codes were not introduced by LR*5.2*476
"BLD",10637,1,7,0)
because it was found that many sites have the codes before LR*5.2*476
"BLD",10637,1,8,0)
was installed. In a nutshell, Mycology will be cleaned up of obsolete
"BLD",10637,1,9,0)
field #19.2; in Bacteriology, the expression LRSPEC=68 will be replaced
"BLD",10637,1,10,0)
with LRSPEC=360.
"BLD",10637,1,11,0)
When the patch is installed, it saves the existing DESCRIPTION field 
"BLD",10637,1,12,0)
contents and the Execute codes in the installation log for later review 
"BLD",10637,1,13,0)
if desired. The log can be used to manually restore local changes found
"BLD",10637,1,14,0)
and not restored by this patch.
"BLD",10637,1,15,0)
 
"BLD",10637,1,16,0)
This patch also modifies the routine LRMISTF by adding the 
"BLD",10637,1,17,0)
preliminary comment fields for Bacteriology, TB Bacteriology, and 
"BLD",10637,1,18,0)
Mycology with corresponding expansion codes so that the canned messages 
"BLD",10637,1,19,0)
from the LAB DESCRIPTIONS file (#62.5) appear during Results Entry
