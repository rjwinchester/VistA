 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. INC000000069340 - Erroneous field in file #68 [Accession]
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The ASSOCIATED DIVISION field (#.01) of the ACCESSION file (#68) should
    allow the entry of a four digit station number.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------- 
    The Data Dictionary of the ACCESSION file has been modified to allow a
    leading 4 digit ASSOCIATED DIVISION (like 5289AK) as long as first 3
    digits match parent division.
  
    Routines: none
  
 2. INC000000071254 - AP Edit Log-In option for location and patient type
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Edit log-in & clinical hx, anat path [LRAPED] option allows a 
    free Text location entry and does not correct the log book or CPT
    transfer to PCE (outpatients only) when changing patient type via
    location edit from inpatient to outpatient or vice versa
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modification has been made to ensure a defined site hospital location 
    must be entered when editing the patient location field when using
    option Edit log-in & clinical hx, anat path [LRAPED]. This will make
    sure the correct location and patient type are propagated to the
    corresponding fields in the ACCESSION file (#68) [ACCESSION NUMBER
    subfile: REPORT ROUTING LOCATION field (#6) and LOCATION TYPE field
    (#92)] and LAB ORDER ENTRY file (#69) [SPECIMEN # subfile: REPORT
    ROUTING LOCATION field (#8)]. This will ensure the log book reflects
    the correct patient location and CPT data transfer to PCE will be based
    on an accurate patient type.
  
    Note: The patch does not correct past location editing issues between 
          in and out patients or inform sites of anomalies. It will not
          address and inpatient to outpatient edits where the CPT data may
          not have been sent to PCE. This is only a reporting issue.
