Description:
============

 Pharmacy Enterprise Customization System (PECS) is a Java 2 Enterprise
 Edition (J2EE) application used to research, review, report, and manage
 customized drug information from First Data Bank's (FDB) MedKnowledge 
 Framework (formerly Drug Information Framework (DIF)), which is a
 Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, used in the enhanced order
 checking process.
  
 The PECS application, through a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI),
 allows VHA pharmacists and clinicians to research and request custom 
 changes to Drug-Drug Interaction, Drug Pairs, Dose Range, Duplicate
 Therapy, and Professional Monograph records, controlling access through a
 role based authorization. VHA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM)
 periodically (as needed in support of VA procedures and priorities)
 prepare, review and approve the customizations, which result in VA Custom
 drug data, which will supersede or enhance the industry standard FDB-drug
 data.
   
 PECS v6.0 includes New Functionality and Enhancements to the system to
 provide better data integrity. It will include fixes to security 
 vulnerabilities identified by HPE Fortify Static Code Analyzer 4.42 with 
 rulepacks 2015.4.0.0008.
 Changes for this release are:
  
 New Functionality 
    * Implement sFTP for PECS, MOCHA Server, and DATUP 
    * WebLogic version Upgrade for PECS per TRM recommendation
    * Implement design solution Comparison Report- redesigns PECS
  
 Enhancements
    * Enhance User Roles functionality
    * Enhancements for PECS Easy Search Dose Range: Add links to PECS 
      records from search results
    * Resolution of export query results limitations in Excel format 
    * Corrected cross-site-scripting vulnerabilities.
    * Corrected open redirect vulnerabilities.
  
  
 Impacts to Administrators, Pharmacists and Clinicians:
  
  1. As a PECS Administrator, I would like the Approver, Release Manager and 
     Administrator functionality to only allow access to users defined in the
     User Roles table with the role assigned so that a user with any of these
     keys in VistA would not be able to perform the role-specific functions
     without the corresponding User Roles definition in PECS.
  
  2. Multiple PECS roles can be assigned to a user.
  
  3. A user must have a corresponding VistA Security Key to have a PECS role
     of Approver, Release Manager, or Administrator
  
  4. As a PECS User, I would like a link to the corresponding PECS record from
     the Easy Search Dose Range results page so that I can access the PECS 
     record.
