Description:
============

 Pharmacy Enterprise Customization System (PECS) is a Java 2 Enterprise
 Edition (J2EE) application used to research, review, report, and manage
 customized drug information from First Data Bank's (FDB) MedKnowledge 
 Framework (formerly Drug Information Framework (DIF)), which is a
 Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, used in the enhanced order
 checking process.
  
 The PECS application, through a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI),
 allows VHA pharmacists and clinicians to research and request custom 
 changes to Drug-Drug Interaction, Drug Pairs, Dose Range, Duplicate
 Therapy, and Professional Monograph records, controlling access through a
 role based authorization. VHA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM)
 periodically (as needed in support of VA procedures and priorities)
 prepare, review and approve the customizations, which result in VA Custom
 drug data, which will supersede or enhance the industry standard FDB-drug
 data.
  
 The purpose of this software product release is to replace the current
 version, PECS v3.0, with an enhanced version, PECS v5.0, which provides
 functional enhancements to Easy Search, Reports, Drug-Drug Interaction 
 (DDI), Drug Pairs(DP), Dose Range(DR), Duplicate Therapy(DT), and 
 Professional Monograph(PM).  
  
 PECS v5.0 includes several enhancements to the system to provide for 
 better data integrity.  The biggest changes for this release are:
 1. Enhancements to export functionality to show the date an approved or
    deleted Drug-Drug Interaction, Drug Pairs, Dose Range, Duplicate Therapy
    or Professional Monograph was exported to the incremental file.
    
 2. Enhancements to non-customized Drug-Drug Interaction, Drug Pairs,
    Dose Range, Duplicate Therapy or Professional Monograph records.
  
 3. Comparison reports for the Dose Range FDB Updates.
  
 4. Enhancement to linking Dose Range records to the FDB record.
         
 5. Removed reverse interactions from the DDI Comparison Report.
  
 6. Enhancements to the contact list.
  
  
 Impacts to Pharmacists and Clinicians:
 1. As a PECS User, pharmacists, clinicians, and PBM personnel on the detail 
    page can see the date an approved or deleted Drug-Drug Interaction,
    Professional Monograph, Duplicate Therapy, or Dose Range customization 
    was successfully exported to the incremental file.
  
 2. As a PECS User, pharmacists, clinicians, and PBM personnel can add 
    comments to non-customized FDB records for Drug-Drug Interaction, 
    Professional Monograph, Duplicate Therapy and Dose Range concepts.
  
 3. As a PECS User, pharmacists, clinicians, and PBM personnel can see a 
    report with the differences between the Dose Range record on file in 
    PECS and the latest incremental FDB update.
  
 4. As a PECS User, pharmacists, clinicians, and PBM personnel can see the 
    changes to the FDB Dose Range record and any associated VA Custom records, 
    with history icons on custom Dose Range records, provides links from 
    custom Dose Range records to the corresponding FDB records and vice versa, 
    includes the FDB record on the Dose Range history report, and displays 
    the VA source of data on the Easy Search tool.
  
 5. PECS Users, pharmacists, clinicians, and PBM  personnel no longer see 
    the reverse interactions on the Drug-Drug Interactions/Drug Pair FDB 
    Comparison report.
  
 6. As a PECS User, pharmacists, clinicians, and PBM personnel will have an 
    editable contact list for the users that includes the ability to generate 
    a hyperlink into email.
