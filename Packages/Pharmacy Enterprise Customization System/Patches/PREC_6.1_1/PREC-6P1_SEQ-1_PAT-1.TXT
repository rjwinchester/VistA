Subject: PECS 6.1 2FA Implementation INFORMATIONAL PATCH

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Pharmacy Enterprise Customization System (PECS) is a Java 2 Enterprise
 Edition (J2EE) application used to research, review, report, and manage
 customized drug information from First Data Bank's (FDB) MedKnowledge 
 Framework (formerly Drug Information Framework (DIF)), which is a
 Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, used in the enhanced order
 checking process.
  
 The PECS application, through a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI),
 allows VHA pharmacists and clinicians to research and request custom 
 changes to Drug-Drug Interaction, Drug Pairs, Dose Range, Duplicate
 Therapy, and Professional Monograph records, controlling access through a
 role based authorization. VHA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM)
 periodically (as needed in support of VA procedures and priorities)
 prepare, review and approve the customizations, which result in VA Custom
 drug data, which will supersede or enhance the industry standard FDB-drug
 data.
  
 In order to comply with the VA mandate on two factor authentication 
 (2FA), the PECS application has been integrated with IAM SSOi. The PECS 
 application code and configuration have been updated to work with the IAM 
 SSOi service for user authentication. The user roles management code in 
 PECS has also been modified to remove dependency on the VistA Security 
 keys for user authorization and use the PECS database tables to store and 
 manage user roles within the PECS application.
  
 The PECS application code was also fixed to address the SFTP connection 
 error which occurs when Centrify is implemented on the SFTP server and 
 the server is joined to Active Directory.
  
 PECS v6.1 also contains a fix for one CA Service Desk Manager ticket

 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
   
 Problem:
 -----------
 The Department of Veterans Affairs Cybersecurity Task Force has been 
 tasked by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Inspector General 
 (IG) to address identified material weaknesses. This task force has 
 mandated that all internal, user facing VA applications become two factor 
 authentication (2FA) compliant by April 30, 2017. 
 In order to be compliant, applications are required to authenticate users 
 via Personal Id entry Verification (PIV) cards.  
 Note: Usernames and password will no longer be permitted for employees 
 and contractors to access VA applications.  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 As part of the transition to two factor authentication (2FA), the PECS 
 application code and configuration have been updated to work with the IAM 
 SSOi service for user authentication. The PECS application has also been 
 modified to remove dependency on the VistA Security keys for user 
 authorization and use the PECS database tables to store and manage user 
 roles within the PECS application.
