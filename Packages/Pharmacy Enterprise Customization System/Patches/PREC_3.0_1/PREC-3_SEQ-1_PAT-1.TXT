Description:
============

 Pharmacy Enterprise Customization System (PECS) is a Java 2 Enterprise
 Edition (J2EE) application used to research, review, report, and manage
 customized drug information from First Data Bank's (FDB) MedKnowledge 
 Framework (formerly Drug Information Framework (DIF)), which is a
 Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) product, used in the enhanced order
 checking process.
  
 The PECS application, through a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI),
 allows VHA pharmacists and clinicians to research and request custom 
 changes to Drug-Drug Interaction, Drug Pairs, Dose Range, Duplicate
 Therapy, and Professional Monograph records, controlling access through a
 role based authorization. VHA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM)
 periodically (as needed in support of VA procedures and priorities)
 prepare, review and approve the customizations, which result in VA Custom
 drug data, which will supersede or enhance the industry standard FDB-drug
 data.
  
 The purpose of this software product release is to replace the current
 version, PECS v2.2.1, with an enhanced version, PECS v3.0, which provides
 functional enhancements to Easy Search, Reports, Drug-Drug Interaction 
 (DDI), Drug Pairs(DP), Dose Range(DR), Duplicate Therapy(DT), and 
 Professional Monograph(PM).  Architectural Enhancements for PECS 3.0 
 includes an upgrade of its use of FDB MedKnowledge Framework support from 
 version 3.2 to version 3.3.
  
 PECS v3.0 includes several enhancements to the system to provide for 
 better data integrity.  The biggest changes for this release are:
 1. Upgrade of the FDB MedKnowledge Framework COTS software from version
 3.2 to version 3.3.
    
 2. Enhancements to query functionality to find Drug information.
  
 3. Enhancements to the customization of Drug information.
  
 4. Easy Search functionality which utilizes MOCHA Server Order Check 
 functionality.
         
 5. Comparison reports for FDB Updates.
  
 Impacts to Pharmacists and Clinicians:
 1. As a PECS User, pharmacists, clinicians, and Pharmacy Benefits 
 Management personnel on the concept detail page can hover their mouse on 
 an icon next to any required field with changes and see the corresponding 
 changes.
  
 2. As a PECS User, pharmacists, clinicians, and Pharmacy Benefits 
 Management personnel can download an Excel report on the full 
 customization history.
  
 3. As a PECS User, pharmacists, clinicians, and Pharmacy Benefits 
 Management personnel within Drug Pair customization can search routed
 generic drugs and add multiple routed generic drugs pairs to the
 associated DDI.
  
 4. As a PECS User, pharmacists, clinicians, and Pharmacy Benefits 
 Management personnel within Easy Search can:
    a) create a query that produces a report that lists the drug pairs 
       and their associated interactions for a Dispensable Generic Drug or
       a Dispensable Drug.
    b) search for Dispensable Drugs along with Dispensable Generics.
    c) view values for  DOSE HIGH, DOSE HIGH UNITS, DOSE RATE HIGH and DOSE
       RATE HIGH UNITS for dose range queries.
