Subject: RTLS INTERFACE WITH VISTA ENGINEERING

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is implementing an integrated, 
 enterprise-wide solution for a Real Time Location System (RTLS) for VA. 
 The RTLS will be used for the purpose of tracking equipment, supplies, 
 and instruments. This patch creates the RTLS interface between 
 Intelligent Insites and the VistA Engineering files EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914)
 and ENG SPACE (#6928).
  
 This patch supports the implementation of the project across the VHA
 network of medical centers in the country. 
  
 PLEASE NOTE:  Upon National Release, all facilities must install 
 both RTLS Asset Tracking (AT) patches (VIAA*1.0*3 and EN*7.0*100)
 in their local production environments, regardless of whether RTLS AT
 will be implemented locally. This process is separate from and not to be 
 confused with activation of these patches.
  Those facilities that will not be using RTLS AT will leave the patches 
 installed in their production environments but will not activate them.
  Those facilities that will be using RTLS AT will be contacted after 
 installation and later on in 2018 by their RTLS vendor. At that time,
 additional instructions regarding software activation and use will be
 provided.
  
  
 New Functionality Exported by This Patch 
 -----------------------------------------
  
 New Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) to support the interface between VistA
 Engineering and RTLS:
  
 a)  VIAA ENG ASSET MOVE: This RPC updates two fields in the EQUIPMENT INV.
 file (#6914) when equipment moves to a new location.
  
 b)  VIAA ENG GET DATA: This RPC returns to RTLS equipment data for a given
 entry number in EQUIPMENT INV. file (#6914).
  
 c)  VIAA ENG GET CATEGORY: This RPC makes three methods for finding
 categories in the EQUIPMENT CATEGORY file (#6911) available to the Java
 client.
  
 d)  VIAA ENG GET EQUIPMENT: This RPC returns all the new entries (by 
 internal entry numbers) from the ENGINEERING INV. file (#6914) for a given
 entry number sent from Intelligent InSites.
  
 e)  VIAA ENG GET LOCATION: This RPC returns 8 fields from the ENG SPACE 
 file (#6928) for all defined rooms (locations).
  
 f)  VIAA ENG GET PRIMARY STATION: This RPC is used to verify that VistA is
 up and the KIDS build for the VIAA package has been installed by the 
 site. No input parameter is required by this RPC.
  
  
 New Option to Send Engineering Record Changes to RTLS Database
 --------------------------------------------------------------
  
 This patch is exporting a new option, 'Make Web Call to Mule' [VIAA
 MAKE WEB CALL TO MULE], that will be used to send Engineering record
 changes (triggered by MUMPS cross-references) to the RTLS database via a
 Mule server. Basically the option is a queue process that can check every
 number of minutes, configured by the site, to see if there are any record 
 changes from files #6914 and #6928 that need to be transmitted to RTLS.  
 For example, the site can schedule the job to run every 3 to 5 minutes 
 for effective record transmission.
  
  
 New File to Hold and Send Engineering Record Changes to RTLS
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  
 A new file, PENDING RTLS EVENTS (#6930), is exported with this patch
 and its only job is to hold any record changes just before transmission 
 to RTLS and when the Mule server is off-line. Once the Mule server comes 
 back online, the next run of the queue will transmit every record it finds
 and the file is cleaned up immediately. While the file may be populated 
 with record changes at any time, its use is limited to very shorts periods
 of time and will not take any disk space at the local site. The PENDING
 RTLS EVENTS file (#6930) introduces a redundancy to save record changes
 that cannot be sent to RTLS when the Mule server goes offline for any
 reason.
  
  
 New Web Service and Web Server
 ------------------------------
  
 The new web service 'VIAA VISTA TRIGGER SERVICE' and the new web 
 server 'VIAA VISTA TRIGGER SERVER' will provide communication with RTLS.
 These new additions will be added by the patch to files WEB SERVICE 
 (#18.02) and WEB SERVER (#18.12) during the post-initialization phase.

 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 -------------------------------------------------- 
 Software being released as a host file and/or documentation describing 
 the new functionality introduced by this patch are available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at the following OI Field Offices:
  
 Hines:                  domain.ext
 Salt Lake City:         domain.ext
  
 The documentation will be in the form of Adobe Acrobat files.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 During the post-initialization of the patch, the menu option
 'RTLS Interface Menu' [VIAA01 RTLS RPC MENU] is updated with the RCP list
 exported with this patch. No user action is required.
  
 After installation of the patch, the site is required to set up a TaskMan 
 job for the new option 'Make Web Call to Mule' [VIAA MAKE WEB CALL TO
 MULE]. Please see the example provided in the Post Installation section of
 this patch. The suggested execution interval for the new job is to run it
 every 3 to 5 minutes (180 - 600 seconds).
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to Engineering users. This patch should take less
 than 5 minutes to install.
  
 Engineering users should not be making record changes in either the 
 EQUIPMENT INV. file (#6914) or the ENG SPACE file (#6928) during 
 installation of this patch. For a list of fields monitored for changes in
 the Engineering files, please see the patch description of EN*7.0*100.
