Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to provide an integration between the
 WaveMark Real Time Location System (RTLS) and VA legacy VistA packages to
 support important Cardiac Catheterization Lab processes involving 
 automated supply inventory, patients, and staff identification.
  
 This patch implements interfaces for queries to the following VistA
 packages and files:
  
 o  Generic Inventory Package (GIP), a module of IFCAP used in VistA
 o  New Person file (#200)
 o  Patient file (#2)
  
 This patch also populates the new option RTLS Interface Menu [VIAA01 RTLS
 RPC MENU] with multiple Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). The new menu will
 be used by the application proxy that was created by Patch VIAA*1.0*1.
  
  
 New Functionality Exported by This Patch: 
 -----------------------------------------
 During installation of the patch, the following RPC menu will be populated
 in VistA:
  
 RTLS Interface Menu    [VIAA01 RTLS RPC MENU]
 This is the RTLS interface menu which includes Remote Procedure Calls for 
 multiple packages and files in VistA.

 After installation of this patch, every site will need to add the 
 application proxy user to the GIP inventory point that handles the Cath
 Lab supplies. This is a one-time set up and is not required if the patch
 is re-installed.
