Subject: AbovePAR - SYNTACTICALLY INCORRECT ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses one issue about a syntactically incorrect error 
 occurring in the interface with the EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) file via the

 1. I18190635FY18 - Error CRITICAL (0) The IENS '-1' is syntactically 
 incorrect
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The AbovePAR Graphical User Interface (GUI) program is designed to 
 provide functionality in parallel with Automated Engineering Management
 System /Medical Equipment Reporting System (AEMS/MERS) to update the
 medical equipment database EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) file.  Triggers on the
 fields in the EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) file run a routine WC^VIAATRI to 
 update the PENDING RTLS EVENTS (#6930) file. This process was failing and 
 causing a hard error that was preventing APAR from updating both the
 EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) and PENDING RTLS EVENTS (#6930) files.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A conditional quit is added between the calls to FILE^DICN and UPDATE^DIE
 in trigger routine WC^VIAATRI. This prevents a syntax error from occurring
 when the returned value from the failed FILE^DICN update is a -1.
  
 Technical:
 ----------
 When triggers on the ENTRY NUMBER (#.01) field fire, they call routine 
 WC^VIAATRI from the EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) file. When this routine is
 called it checks the PENDING RTLS EVENTS (#6930) file to see if the entry
 is already there, and if it is not then routine makes a call to FILE^DICN
 to add the entry as a stub. After this it calls UPDATE^DIE to complete the
 entry. If FILE^DICN fails it submits a negative 1 value to UPDATE^DIE as a
 record internal entry number (IEN). The failure results in a syntax error
 that causes a number of changes to FileMan variables that force
 termination of the update. The syntax error is returned to the remote
 procedure call (RPC) called by APAR. Trigger firing precedence seems to be
 the root cause of persistent failure, so this prevents AbovePAR from
 submitting records.

 3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter "VIAA*1.0*6"):
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
          not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.

          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
          this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
          patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
          in the transport global.
  
 4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package.
