Subject: REAL TIME LOCATION SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is implementing an integrated, 
 enterprise-wide solution for a Real Time Location System (RTLS) for VA. 
 The RTLS will be used for the purpose of tracking equipment, supplies, 
 and instruments.
  
 This patch supports the implementation of the project across the VHA
 network of medical centers in the country.
  
  
 New Functionality Exported by This Patch: 
 -----------------------------------------
 During installation of the patch, the following menu option will
 be created in VistA:
  
 RTLS Interface Menu    [VIAA01 RTLS RPC MENU]
 This is the RTLS interface menu which will include Remote Procedure
 Calls (RPC) in future patches.

 PROXY' with the secondary menu option RTLS Interface Menu [VIAA01 RTLS RPC
 MENU].

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ------------------------------------- 
 Software being released as a host file and/or documentation describing 
 the new functionality introduced by this patch are available.
   
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
   
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directory at the following OI Field Offices:
   
 Albany:          domain.ext
 Hines:           domain.ext 
 Salt Lake City:  domain.ext
   
 The documentation will be in the form of Adobe Acrobat files.
   
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library.
  
  
 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 Pre-installation Step:
  
 FOR RTLS Cath Lab Installations only:
 A procedure for the creation of a connector proxy user will be provided
 to each medical center and is to be completed before the first time
 installation of this patch. This is a one-time task and no other proxy
 user is to be created by the site for use by RTLS.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 FOR RTLS Cath Lab Installations only:
 The sites need to create the user 'VIAASERVICE,RTLS CONNECTOR PROXY'.
 Instructions are provided in the RTLS Cardiac Catheterization Lab
 Interfaces VistA Patch Installation Guide.
  
 The connector proxy user set up is checked for correctness. For RTLS 
 Asset Tracking only deployments, the resulting messages can be ignored.
  
 During the post-installation of the patch, the application proxy user 
 'VIAASERVICE,RTLS APPLICATION PROXY' will be created automatically. Also
 the application proxy user will be assigned a secondary menu option
 exported with this patch. No other menu, either primary or secondary, may
 be assigned to this user.
  
 Future installations of this patch will check for the presence of the 
 proxy users but will not make any changes. A site re-installing this
 patch does not need to complete any additional set ups for pre-init or
 post-init operations.
