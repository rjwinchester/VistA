Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_Production_Overview_Guide_Groups_3_4.pdf) posted on the Anonymous 
 directory for installation order. This is critical for proper 
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the implementation date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
 systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
 which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research. 
  
 The following functionalities within the Clinical Procedures (CP)
 application were updated to address the ICD-10 code set.
  
 If the Patient visit date is prior to the ICD-10 implementation date, 
 the VistA Clinical Procedures Hemodialysis application will retain 
 all current functionality.
  
 If the Patient visit date is after the ICD-10 implementation date, 
 the VistA Clinical Procedures Hemodialysis application will provide the 
 following updates to the CP User window, Hemodialysis Patient Data Screen
 Summary, Diagnosis tab:
  
  1. Search on ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes 
  
  2. Add/edit/store ICD-10 diagnosis codes (up to 8 alphanumeric characters
     including the decimal point that follows the 3rd character).
  
  3. Display ICD-10 diagnosis codes and descriptions.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
  
 This patch includes an M patch and a revised Graphical User Interface(GUI)
 executable.
  
 Installation of the patch will not take more than 5 minutes. This patch
 can be installed with VistA users online, but users should be logged out 
 of Clinical Procedures as the new Hemodialysis GUI, version 1.0.29.22, is
 installed.
  
 Prior Hemodialysis GUI versions will not be compatible with the VistA
 server software for this patch. Therefore, it is crucial that the Clinical
 Procedures client GUI distributed with this patch be installed immediately
 following the VistA server software install to minimize service disruption
 to the Clinical Procedures Hemodialysis users.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the 
 following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their 
 descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the 
 KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
 HEMODIALYSIS USER         [MD HEMODIALYSIS USER]
