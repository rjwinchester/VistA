Subject: CP HEMO HELP FILE UPDATE AND DELPHI UPGRADE

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues in the Clinical Procedures 
 (CP) Hemodialysis application.
  
 1. RTC 770203 - CP Hemodialysis - XE10 Conversion
 The Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Information and Technology
 requires that applications remain compliant with the Technical Reference
 Model (TRM) regarding the version of tools used for development. This
 patch accomplished this by updating the version of Delphi to XE10.2.
  
 2. RTC 770202 - CP Hemodialysis - Windows 10 help file format conversion
 While evaluating Windows 10, it was discovered that the Help files
 would not display correctly. This patch will correct this problem by
 converting the help files to a new format.
  
 3. RTC 770205 - CP Hemodialysis - Network share help file
 Many of the VistA instances are now pushing their Graphical User
 Interface (GUI) installations to network share drives, rather than
 installing on individual machines. It was discovered that the online help
 would not work when the application was installed on the network share
 drive. This patch corrects this problem.
  
 4. RTC 782211 - CP Hemodialysis - Memory leak detections and cleanup
