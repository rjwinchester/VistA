Subject: CP FLOWSHEETS WINDOWS 10 HELP FILE

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues in the Clinical Procedures 
 (CP) Flowsheets application.
  
 1. CP Flowsheets - XE10 Conversion
 The Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Information and Technology
 requires that applications remain compliant with the Technical Reference
 Model (TRM) regarding the version of tools used for development. This
 patch accomplished this by updating the version of Delphi to XE10.2.
  
 2. CP Flowsheets - Windows 10 help file format conversion
 While evaluating Windows 10, it was discovered that the Help files would
 not display correctly. This patch will correct this problem by 
 converting the help files to a new format.
