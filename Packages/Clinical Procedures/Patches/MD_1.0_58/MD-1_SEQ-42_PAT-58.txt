Subject: CP FLOWSHEETS BOOL DATA EDITING, SCROLLING, AUTO-REFRESH

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes three bugs in Clinical Procedures(CP) Flowsheets.
  
 1. The user is unable to edit Boolean values in observations.
  
 2. If the user spins the mouse wheel, it will cause the program to cycle
    through either the list of available flowsheets or the list of
    available locations (depending on where the user is in the software).
  
 3. If the auto-refresh happens at the same time as the user clicking on
    the "Refresh" button for a flowsheet with totals, the totals can show
    incorrect results (usually doubled).
  
 NOTE: Patch MD*1*58 includes a new GUI executable for CP Flowsheets.
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. I9397560FY16 - IN CP Flowsheets, terms using Boolean operators cannot 
 be edited.
  
 Problem:
 --------
  
 In CP Flowsheets, observations with Boolean (Yes/No) values could not be 
 edited. Attempting to do so would result in an error: "Error validating 
 Filer Document."
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  
 The logic of the function to extract and validate the edited value was 
 fixed in the Delphi code to support Booleans. Previously, it would return
 an empty string for any edited Boolean value.
  
  
 2. I9596539FY16 - Mouse scrolling creates errors
  
 Problem:
 --------
  
 In CP Flowsheets, scrolling with mousewheel after selecting a flowsheet 
 name will result in multiple error dialog windows and delays in getting 
 to the flowsheet on which user needs to document. When adding data to a 
 view, scrolling after selecting a Location will result in a different 
 location than user intended.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  
 The Delphi code was updated so that mousewheel scrolling no longer affects
 the flowsheet or location dropdown lists (unless the list is actually
 dropped down). Also, mousewheel scrolling now affects the scrollable
 content under the mouse throughout the software.
  
  
 3. I16749714FY18 - auto refresh issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
  
 In CP Flowsheets, when auto-refresh is active, if the user clicks on the 
 "Refresh" button at the same time the auto-refresh happens (or if the 
 user rapidly clicks multiple times on the "Refresh" button), the 
 flowsheet totals could be erroneously calculated.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  
 The refresh function that calculates the flowsheet totals has been changed
 in the Delphi code to prevent unintended re-entry (which would cause it to
 calculate totals multiple times, adding them together).

 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 -------------------------------------------------- 
  
 This Software is being released with both a VistA component, and an 
 updated Graphical User Interface (GUI). Files and documentation
 pertaining to this patch are available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directory at the following OI Field Offices:

 Installation Guide
  
 Patch Installation:
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 Clinical Procedures users should be off the system when this patch is 
 installed. Installation will take less than 5 minutes. This patch should 
 be installed during non-peak requirement hours.
  
      1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
      2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
         the Installation menu.
   
      3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options (when
         prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter MD*1*58).      
  
         a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
            backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch 
            is installed
         c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
            the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
         d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
            the components of the KIDS build.
      
      4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
         MD*1.0*58.                               
   
      5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during install? 
         NO//", respond NO.
   
      6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
         and Protocols? NO//", respond NO.
  
 Post Installation Overview:
 ---------------------------
  
 A post-installation routine , MDPOST58, is provided which updates Clinical
 Procedures with the expected version number for CP Flowsheets.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;1.0;CLINICAL PROCEDURES;**[Patch List]**;Apr 01, 2004;Build 2

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.
