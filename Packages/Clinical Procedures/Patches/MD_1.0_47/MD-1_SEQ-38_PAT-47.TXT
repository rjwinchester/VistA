Subject: MODIFICATIONS TO UTILIZE IMMUN FILE GROUP DATA

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issue:
 The Clinical Procedures package subscribes to ICR #1239 to access the
 IMMUN^PXRHS03 API.  
      
 The IMMUN^PXRHS03 API returns a list of immunizations administered to a
 patient, sorted by the Immunization Short Name. However, the VistA
 Immunizations Enhancements project (VIMM) has standardized the
 IMMUNIZATION file (#9999999.14) and locked it down. It is now updated by
 the Standards and Technology Services (STS) via the Master File Server
 (MFS), and the Short Name will no longer be used; i.e., it is not
 standardized nationally, and will be null for newer immunizations added in
 patch PX*1*201 and later.
      
 This affects the Clinical Procedures Hemodialysis Application, as it is 
 searching for specific immunization short names; e.g., "HEPA", "HEPB",
 "INFLUENZA", "PNEUMO-VAC", and these won't be populated for newer
 immunizations.

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1) I9088043FY16 Immunization Search
  
 Problem 1:
 ---------
 With the SHORT NAME field (#.02) no longer being populated by the VistA 
 Immunizations Enhancements project, modifications are needed to modify how
 the Clinical Procedures Hemodialysis application searches for patient
 Immunization Data.
       
 Resolution 1:
 ------------  
 Modify routine MDKRPC1 to search and include patient immunization records
 using the IMMUNIZATION file (#9999999.14) VACCINE GROUP NAME field (#7) as
 well as the SHORT NAME field (#.02). The routine changes are needed to
 accommodate data changes made by the VistA Immunizations Enhancement
 Project.  
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the
 Clinical Procedures users be off the system. Other VistA users will not be
 affected.
