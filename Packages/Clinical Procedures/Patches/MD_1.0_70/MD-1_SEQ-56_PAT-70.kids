package:

"BLD",11111,1,5,0)
The default value for Diagnosis date and Initial Therapy date is set to 
"BLD",11111,1,6,0)
the arbitrarily value of 12-30-1899. Initial analysis showed that the 
"BLD",11111,1,7,0)
code was looking for that specific date to replace it with a null entry, 
"BLD",11111,1,8,0)
but this code was being bypassed incorrectly
