 1. INC3064685 - Need assistance from National CLIN III Support Team for
 changes that need to be made to Clinical Procedures V 1.0 Hemodialysis
 module 
  
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 The default value for Diagnosis date and Initial Therapy date is set to 
 the arbitrarily value of 12-30-1899. Initial analysis showed that the 
 code was looking for that specific date to replace it with a null entry, 
 but this code was being bypassed incorrectly
  
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
 The CP Hemodialysis GUI was modified to prevent the "Correction" 
 code from being bypassed.
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center, OH
 Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital, IL
