Subject: CP USER NETWORK HELP FILE

  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues in the CP User application
  
 1. CP User - XE10 Conversion
 The Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Information and Technology
 requires that applications remain compliant with the Technical Reference
 Model (TRM) regarding the version of tools used for development. This
 patch accomplished this by updating the version of Delphi to XE10.2.
  
 2. CP User - Windows 10 help file format conversion
 While evaluating Windows 10, it was discovered that the Help files would
 not display correctly. This patch will correct this problem by converting
 the help files to a new format.
  
 3. CP User - Network share help file
 Many of the VistA instances are now pushing their Graphical User
 Interface (GUI) installations to network share drives, rather than
 installing on individual machines. It was discovered that the online 
 help would not work when the application was installed on the network
 share drive. This patch corrects this problem.
