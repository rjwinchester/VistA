Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issue:
                  
 In preparation for the VA's transition from Internet Protocol version 
 4 (IPv4) to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), the Clinical Procedures
 package will require modifications to make it IPv6 ready.
      
 Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the latest version of the Internet 
 Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification
 and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across 
 the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force 
 (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address 
 exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4.
       
 Vista is only compatible with IPv4 currently and this effort is to prepare
 for IPv6 compatibility.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================     
 1) INC000001095728 Clinical Procedures - IPv6 Conversion
            
   Problem:
   --------
  In a Clinical Procedures testing environment, an Internet Protocol (IP) 
  address is designated to serve as a medical device since we can't test in
  a testing environment with an actual medical device.  The current
  structure of the IP address is coded for Internet Protocol Version 4 
  (IPv4) and needs to be changed to handle the upcoming Internet Protocol
  Version 6 (IPv6) structure.  A Data Dictionary change is also needed in 
  CP INSTRUMENT file (#702.09), IP ADDRESS Field (#.14).
      
   Resolution:
   ------------  
  As part of the transition for Clinical Procedures, modifications were 
  required to include evaluation of the current system to determine what 
  version of IP is enabled and format each referenced loopback address 
  accordingly.  Routines MDHL7B and MDRPCOT1 will be modified to handle
  both IPv4 and IPv6 data structures by adding a supplied API call to
  CONVERT^XLFIPV.
