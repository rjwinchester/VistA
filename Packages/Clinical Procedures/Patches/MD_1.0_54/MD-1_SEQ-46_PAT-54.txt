Subject: INSTRUMENT CANCELLATION, AUTO CHECK-IN AND CP CONSOLE (GUI) FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch addresses these four issues:
  
 1.  A cancellation message is not being sent to the instrument 
     when an order is cancelled or discontinued through CPRS.
  
 2.  TIU Note Title of Procedures edited in CP Console (GUI) are being
     lost.
  
 3.  Attempting to import in CP Console (GUI) results in an error.
  
 4.  A follow up CP order placed the same day as a scheduled CP order
     will check in without it being scheduled.

 Overview:
 =========
  
 1. I9850587FY16 - Instrument Cancellation Message Issue
   
    Problem: 
    ========
    A cancellation message is not sent to the instrument if two entries
    exist in CP USER for a consult with one having a "NEW" status and the
    other one having a "PENDING INSTRUMENT DATA" status.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    For procedures which are cancelled in CPRS, routines MDWOR and MDWORC
    have been modified to loop through all entries in the CP TRANSACTION
    (#702) file and set the status as "cancelled".  If an entry had a
    status of "Pending Instrument Data", a cancellation HL7 message is sent
    to the instrument.
   
    Routines: MDWOR and MDWORC
  
 2. I9914178FY16 - TIU Note Title Issue (CP Console)
  
    Problem: 
    ========
    TIU Notes assigned to Procedures in CP Console aren't being saved.
    (Technically, the TIU Notes weren't being *loaded*, but the net result 
    was the same.)
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    The loading code was fixed to properly load in the TIU Note ID assigned
    to the Procedure.
  
 3. I17133608FY18 - Error when importing (CP Console)
  
    Problem:
    ========
    In CP Console, when attempting an import (Tools menu, Import from
    XML...) an access violation occurs.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    The initialization code for the Import from XML form was corrected to
    fix an improper loop.
  
 4. R6900025FY16 - An issue with procedure requests
  
    Problem:
    ========
    A CP is ordered and scheduled for today. When it preformed the
    clinician decides to order a follow up to the CP. When the 
    follow up CP is signed in CPRS GUI, it will auto check in 
    without an appointment for it having been made.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Modification of routines MDWOR, MDWORSR, and new routine
    MDWORSR2 to determine if a CP is already scheduled for 
    that day and prevent the follow up CP from auto checked in. 
  
    Routine: MDWOR,MDWORSR,MDWORSR2

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ==========================
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
