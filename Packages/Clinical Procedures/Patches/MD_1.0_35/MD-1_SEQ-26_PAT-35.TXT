Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following 3 issues:
  
 1) The Clinical Procedures (CP) Terminology TERM file (#704.101) contains
    terms used during data entry/display in CP Flowsheet.  The Office of
    Informatics and Analytics - Applied Informatics (AI) Terminology Review
    Group submitted a spreadsheet requesting additions or updates of 77
    Terms.
      
 2) Numeric Terms in Clinical Flowsheets have the ability to be Totaled 
    and/or Sub-Totaled. Some should NOT be totaled because they may cause
    confusion and lead to incorrect clinical decisions.  
  
 3) A record in CP Terminology TERM_QUALIFIER_PAIR File (#704.103) was
    identified by a Salt Lake City Development group as a circular
    reference (or a record with an invalid pairing of Parent/Child
    records).  They requested the record be removed from the file. The
    record does not cause any errors.

 Post-Init routine MDTERMX will make the above Additions/Modifications to
 the CP Terminology TERM File (#704.101) and TERM_TYPE file (#704.102) as
 described in the Problem Section above. The details of each of these terms
 is in the Clinical Observation (CliO) Terminology Dictionary And Clinical
 Data Model Documentation that is listed below.

 PSPO:

 PSPO #2448
  
 Problem: 2
 ----------
 Any numeric term in CP Flowsheets has the potential to be totaled or 
 subtotaled at the discretion of the CP Flowsheet Coordinator.  This is done 
 by placing a check mark in the Display Totals Row or Display Subtotals by 
 Time Interval boxes within the Term Display Properties when building a 
 Flowsheet View.  This was a part of the original design of the software.  
 HOWEVER, some terms should NOT be totaled because they may cause confusion
 and lead to incorrect clinical decisions.
      
 Resolution: 2
 -------------
 Post-Init routine MDTERMX will make the changes to the CP Terminology
 TERM File (#704.101) for the following terms that, if totaled, are
 considered "high risk" by Informatics Patient Safety and the Applied
 Informatics Service (AIS) CP Flowsheets Terminology Team. Each term will 
 be changed to include the phrase "Do not check Total or Subtotals" in the
 actual term name.

 Problem: 3
 ----------
 While testing Terminology Patch MD*1*32, a development group in Salt Lake
 City found a circular record reference in the CP Terminology
 TERM_QUALIFIER_PAIR File (#704.103) at record IEN 2381.  While this record
 is not causing any problems, they felt that it should be removed from the
 file.
      
 Resolution: 3
 -------------
 Post-Init routine MDTERMX will remove the circular file reference from 
 the CP Terminology TERM_QUALIFIER_PAIR File (#704.103).
