Subject: CP FLOWSHEET DATE RANGE SELECTOR, MOUSE WHEEL, AND NETWORK HELP FILE

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes the following bugs in Clinical Procedures (CP)
 Flowsheets:
  
 1. When opening the Date Range Selector in CP Flowsheets, the calendar 
 that displays the month does not display the full month. The column for 
 Saturday is either fully or partially obscured.
  
 2. In CP Flowsheets, if the user spins the mouse wheel over the Windows 
 desktop or another running application while Flowsheets has keyboard 
 focus, it may cause the program to cycle through either the list of 
 available flowsheets or the list of available locations (depending on 
 where the user is in the software).
  
 3. When running CP Flowsheets from a network drive or shared network 
 folder, the user can't access the help file.
  
 NOTE: Patch MD*1*61 includes a new Graphical User Interface (GUI)
 executable for CP Flowsheets.
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. CA-SDM R17135139FY18 - Clinical Procedure Flowsheets Date Range
    Selector.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When opening the Date Range Selector in CP Flowsheets, the calendar that 
 displays the month does NOT display the column for Saturday. Only Sunday 
 through Friday are visible to the user. It is possible for a user to click
 on arrows beside the Today button to move the date into the Saturday
 column. However, this is neither intuitive nor efficient.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Date Range Selector form was widened sufficiently for both calendars
 to be fully visible.
  
 2. INC0275439 - Mouse scrolling creates errors
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In CP Flowsheets, if the user spins the mouse wheel over the Windows 
 desktop or another running application while Flowsheets has keyboard 
 focus, it may cause the program to cycle through either the list of 
 available flowsheets or the list of available locations (depending on
 where the user is in the software).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Delphi code was updated so that scrolling the mouse wheel while the 
 mouse is pointing off the application does not affect combo boxes.
  
 3. INC0452105 - Network help file for CP Flowsheets
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When CP Flowsheets is run from a network drive or network shared folder, 
 the help file cannot be accessed. This is due to changes in Windows 
 security that don't allow a program that is run off a network to open help
 files that aren't on the local computer.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The first time the user attempts to access the help file, the file is 
 downloaded to the user's local hard drive. Then it can be used normally.
