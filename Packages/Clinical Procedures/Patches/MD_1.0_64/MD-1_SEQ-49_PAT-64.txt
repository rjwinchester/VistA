Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues in the Clinical Procedures 
 (CP) Console application.
  
 1.      While evaluating Windows 10, it was discovered that the Help 
 files would not display correctly. This patch will correct this problem 
 by converting the help files to a new format.
 2.      The Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Information and 
 Technology requires that applications remain compliant with the Technical 
 Reference Model (TRM) regarding the version of tools used for 
 development. This patch accomplished this by updating the version of 
 Delphi to XE10.2.
 3.      Many of the VistA instances are now pushing their Graphical User 
 Interface (GUI) installations to network share drives, rather than 
 installing on individual machines. It was discovered that the online help 
 would not work when the application was installed on the network share 
 drive. This patch corrects this problem.
