Subject: HIGH VOLUME PROCEDURE SETUP MODIFICATION AND CP CONVERSION UTILITIES

Category:

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
  
    High Volume Procedure Setup modifications
    Consult / Procedure to Clinical Procedure conversion utilities

 Problem A:
 =========
 When a Clinical Procedure (CP) is configured for High Volume (auto 
 complete), the associated note title in the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file 
 (#8925.1) must have the COMMIT ACTION (#4.1) and POST-SIGNATURE CODE
 (#4.9)fields set to 'Q'. Local clinical application coordinators (CACs) do
 not have access to edit these fields through their TIU menu options as the
 fields require programmer access to edit.  The application end user (AEU)
 must log a ticket for a support person with programmer access to set those
 fields for them, which take days or even weeks at times, creating delays
 with patient care.
  
 Resolution A:
 ============
 The menu option 'High Volume Procedure Setup' [MD HIGH VOLUME] is modified
 to automatically set the COMMIT ACTION field (#4.1) and POST-SIGNATURE
 field (#4.9) to 'Q' for the associated note title in the TIU DOCUMENT
 DEFINITION file (#8925.1).  The title is pulled from the clinical
 procedure being edited in the 'High Volume Procedure Setup' menu and
 pertinent information is displayed to the AEU for that title.  The AEU
 must inactivate the title using their preferred TIU document definition
 editor menu prior to using the High Volume Procedure Setup menu to edit
 the title. If the title is not inactive, the fields will not be set. 
  
 In the case of removing a clinical procedure from the high volume setup,
 the option can be used to remove the 'Q's from the two technical 
 fields. The title must be inactive for this as well.
  
 The High Volume Procedure Setup menu can still be used to edit procedures 
 without editing the title's technical fields. This is appropriate when 
 editing one that is already configured for high volume, but is being
 edited for additional features.  In this case, the associated note title
 can remain in an active status.
  
 Problem B:
 =========
 When a new Clinical Procedures (CP) interface is stood up, existing
 consults and/or procedures in pending/scheduled/active statuses need to
 be converted to clinical procedures.  The manual process is to
 discontinue the old consult or procedure and enter a new one under CP.
 This is a time-consuming process to track down providers and have them
 re-enter orders for their patients.  Alternatively, a class III utility
 was available to automate this process, however it is often impossible
 for sites to get permission to install and run a class III routine for
 any reason.
  
 Resolution B:
 ============
 The class III utilities will be made class I and released with patch
 MD*1.0*65.  There will be two new menu options called 'Consult
 to Clinical Procedure conversion utility' [MD CONCONVERT] and 'Procedure 
 to Clinical Procedure conversion utility' [MD PROCONVERT] to run these
 conversion utilities.  The new menu options will reside on the 'Conversion
 Utilites' [MD UTILITIES] and will be locked with security key MD
 ADMINISTRATOR. The conversion utilities will not allow a consult or 
 procedure that is setup for DICOM in the CLINICAL SPECIALTY DICOM & HL7 
 file (#2006.5831) to be selected for conversion.
  
  
 Documentation Distribution:
 ===========================
 Documentation is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of
 the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices.
  
 The preferred method is to SFTP the files from: Download.vista.domain.ext
  
 This transmits files from the first available SFTP server. Sites may
 also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
       Albany                  ftp.domain.ext
       Hines                   ftp.domain.ext
       Salt Lake City          ftp.domain.ext
  
 File Name:             Description:                     Protocol:
 ==========             ============                     =========
 clinproc1_impg.docx    CP Implementation Guide          BINARY
 clinproc1_tm.docx      CP Technical Manual              BINARY
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the
 Clinical Procedures users be off the system.  Other VISTA users will not
 be affected.
  
 Install Time - less than 2 minutes (unless otherwise indicated)
  
 1.  Load Transport Global
     ---------------------
     Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the
     INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
 2.  Start Up KIDS
     -------------
     Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
     [XPD MAIN]:
          Edits and Distribution ...
          Utilities ...
          Installation ...
  
     Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: INStallation

          Install Package(s)
          Restart Install of Package(s)
          Unload a Distribution
          Backup a Transport Global
  
 3.  Select Installation Option:
     ---------------------------
     NOTE:  The following are OPTIONAL, however backing up the Transport
     Global is required for the back-out strategy.
  
     When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter MD*1.0*65:
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch (routines,
         DD's, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
  
 4.  Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
     ----------------------------------------------
     **This is the step to start the installation of this KIDS patch:
     a.  Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch install.
  
     b.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         NO//', answer NO.
  
     c. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
        Options, and Protocols? YES//', answer YES.
  
        When prompted, 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of order':',
        enter the following options:
  
        Disable the following VistA options:
        ----------------------------------------
        High Volume Procedure Setup      [MD HIGH VOLUME PROCEDURE SETUP]
  
        When prompted, 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of
        order':',press <ENTER>.
  
  
 Back-out/Roll-back Strategy:
 ===========================
  Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
  development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision
  to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between
  development team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA
  personnel. A national help desk ticket should be logged before attempting
  any back-out procedures.
  
  Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
  saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
  Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
  install). The message containing the backed-up routines can be loaded
  with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The
  Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the
  backed-up routines onto the VistA System.
