Subject: CP USER LOCKING BUG CREATING DUPLICATE TIU NOTES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to provide a software bug fix for Clinical 
 Procedures functionality. This patch addresses the following issue:
  
 1. Duplicate reports with the same time stamp

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. I9896708FY16 - duplicate reports with the same time stamp
  
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 Due to a locking issue, it is possible for multiple users to create
 duplicate TIU [Text Integrated Utility] documents with the same time 
 stamp for a single CP request for a patient. When the MD scheduled tasks
 are running at close frequencies and overlaps, the studies end up with two
 notes at the same date and time. A duplicate note can cause the image to
 be linked to the wrong note, and also the provider can put their
 interpretation on the wrong note. The attachment and interpretation should
 be together. 
  
 Solution 1:
 -----------
 Added locks to routine MDRPCOT so that duplicate documents can no longer 
 be created.
  
 Test Sites
 ----------
 James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center (Altoona, PA)

             1      Load a Distribution
             2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
             3      Print Transport Global
             4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
             5      Backup a Transport Global
             6      Install Package(s)
                    Restart Install of Package(s)
                    Unload a Distribution
    
    3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
        (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter MD*1.0*43):
    
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
            not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
            will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
            this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
            patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
            allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
            in the transport global.
    
    4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package

            Options and Protocols? NO//", answer NO.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 None
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
