Description:
============

 Clinical Procedures and DICOM Consult Request Tracking.
  
 This patch and MAG*3.0*208 work together to greatly improve
 interoperability between Clinical Procedures and VistA Imaging CPRS
 Consult Request Tracking DICOM.
  
 The CP studies have the same Instrument Order Number as the regular
 consult and procedure Accession Number (sss-GMR-nnnnnnnn).
  
 This allows DICOM objects created during a CP examination to be sent to
 VistA Imaging and be processed automatically.  It also allows them to be
 used with all of the other DICOM services, like query/retrieve and export.
  
 Reports in DICOM Encapsulated PDF are highly recommended.

 Problem A:
 ----------
 Many devices setup for Clinical Procedures also have DICOM capabilities 
 however due to the VistA Imaging (VI) and Clinical Procedures (CP) 
 packages using different accession number formats, clinicians are not able
 to utilize both in a seamless manner.
  
 Resolution A:
 -------------
 A new parameter was added to the CP INSTRUMENT FILE (#702.09) called CP -
 DICOM INTEROPERABLILTY. A new VistA option called 'CP - DICOM 
 Interoperability' [MD DICOM] has been created to access this parameter.
  
 This parameter has three options:
  
        0        No special action
        1        Use VistA Imaging accession number sss-GMR-nnnnnnnn
        2        Use VistA Imaging HL7 instead of CP's HL7
  
 Option '0' is used for devices that do not utilize DICOM.
 Option '1' will use the VI style accession number instead of the CP 
 Instrument Order Number. 
 Option '2' will provide an enhanced HL7 message body in addition to the
 VI style accession number.
  
 Additionally, the VI worklist will receive the order message at the time 
 of CP Check-in instead of when the order is signed/released in CPRS.
  
  
 Problem B:
 ----------
 A 'Consult Keep Open' parameter was added to the CP INSTRUMENT file 
 (#702.09) with patch MD*1.0*42 but no option was provided to set it.
  
 Resolution B:
 -------------
 A new menu option was created for this parameter called 'Keep Consult Open
 for CART-CL' [MD CARTCL].
  
 CONSULT KEEP OPEN: ?
      Enter Yes to keep consult note open or No to close consult note.
      Choose from:
        0        No
        1        Yes
  
 A parent menu called CP Coordinator [MD COORDINATOR] has also been created
 that will contain the two new menu options with this patch as well as two
 existing menu options.
  
     CP Coordinator Menu
  
           Auto Study Check-In Setup
           CP - DICOM Interoperability
           High Volume Procedure Setup
           Keep Consult Open for CART-CL
  
  
 Documentation Distribution:
 ===========================
 Documentation is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of
 the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices.
  
 The preferred method is to SFTP the files from: Download.vista.domain.ext
  
 This transmits files from the first available SFTP server. Sites may
 also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
       Albany                  ftp.domain.ext
       Hines                   ftp.domain.ext
       Salt Lake City          ftp.domain.ext

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the
 Clinical Procedures users be off the system.  Other VISTA users will not
 be affected.
  
 Install Time - less than 2 minutes (unless otherwise indicated)
  
 1.  Load Transport Global
     ---------------------
     Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the
     INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
 2.  Start Up KIDS
     -------------
     Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
     [XPD MAIN]:
          Edits and Distribution ...
          Utilities ...
          Installation ...
  
     Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: INStallation
                                                              ---
          Load a Distribution
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Install Package(s)
          Restart Install of Package(s)
          Unload a Distribution
          Backup a Transport Global
  
 3.  Select Installation Option:
     ---------------------------
     NOTE:  The following are OPTIONAL, however backing up the Transport
     Global is required for the back-out strategy. 
  
     When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter MD*1.0*60:
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch (routines,
         DD's, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
  
 4.  Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
     ----------------------------------------------
     **This is the step to start the installation of this KIDS patch:
     a.  Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch install.
  
     b.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         NO//', answer NO.
  
     c. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu
        Options, and Protocols? NO//', answer NO.
  
 Back-out/Roll-back Strategy:
 ===========================
  
  Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
  development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision
  to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between
  development team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA
  personnel. A national help desk ticket should be logged before attempting
  any backout procedures.
  
  Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
  saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
  Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
  install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded
  with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The
  Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the
  backed up routines onto the VistA System.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
