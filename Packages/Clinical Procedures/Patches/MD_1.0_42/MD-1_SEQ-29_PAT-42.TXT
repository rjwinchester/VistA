Subject: CP Uni-Directional Configuration Option

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The NSR20131203 Clinical Procedures Uni-directional Configuration Option 
 enhancement entails changing the current VistA functionality to add a 
 flag to the Clinical Procedures (CP) Instrument File so that CP will send 
 only an "outbound" Health Level 7 (HL7) message containing Computerized 
 Patient Record System (CPRS) patient information to the medical 
 instrument. The CP procedure is automatically placed in Completed status 
 after the HL7 message is sent, thus preventing an "inbound" HL7 message 
 containing the test results from being sent back to the CPRS Consult 
 Note.   
  
 The physician can then edit the Consult Note by manually pasting in data 
 from a test result reporting system to complete the Consult.  
 This modification is beneficial for users of reporting systems-such as 
 the Clinical Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking System for Cardiac 
 Catheterization Laboratories (CART-CL) application-who do not want the 
 test results from the medical instrument to populate the CPRS Consult 
 Note, but prefer to manually paste the test results from the reporting 
 system into the Consult Note.  
  
 The CONSULT KEEP OPEN field in the CP INSTRUMENT File (#702.09) must be 
 set to Yes for this functionality to work.  This triggers the routines 
 that put the CP procedure in Completed status to interrupt the 
 bi-directional flow.
