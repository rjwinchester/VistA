Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issue:
  
 1) The Clinical Procedures (CP) Terminology TERM file (#704.101) and the 
    TERM_TYPE file (#704.102) contain terms used during data entry/display
    in CP Flowsheet.  The Office of Informatics and Analytics - Applied
    Informatics Services (AIS) Terminology Review Group submitted a
    spreadsheet requesting additions or updates of 46 Terms.
  
    NOTE: These 46 terms were split out over 5 separate tickets for 
          ease of entering, they are not 5 separate issues, but 1 umbrella
          issue with 1 resolution.
