Subject: PROCEDURE AUTO CHECK-IN ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following 4 issues:
  
 1) Procedure Auto Check-in functionality with Clinical Procedures (CP) 
    does not work if you have a patient with two or more appointments 
    scheduled for the same day, with two different procedures, in two 
    different clinics. It will only check-in one, causing the user to have
    to perform manual check-ins for the  other procedures.
  
 2) When Patch MD*1.0*23 was released, the Implementation Guide was not 
    updated completely. There are references to a 'Permissions Button' and
    instructions on how to use the Permissions Button' in the CP Console
    GUI that no longer exist.
  
 3) During data entry in menu Auto Study Check-In Setup [MD AUTO CHECK-IN 
    SETUP] option, if the user attempts to use an "^" (up-caret) to exit
    the option during a procedure/Clinic lookup, an UNDEF (Undefined) error
    will occur.
  
 4) During the release of patch MD*1.0*23, an interface routine was not 
    included with the patch distribution by mistake.  This routine,
    MDHL7M3, needs to be available for sites if they plan to use a GE Image
    Vault Electrocardiogram Storage Device.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================           
 1) INC000000451758 Auto Study Check-In Not Working
  
 Problem: #1
 -----------
 When using the Procedure Auto Check-in functionality with Clinical 
 Procedures, if you have a patient with two or more appointments scheduled
 for the same day, with two different procedures, in two different clinics,
 the system will not Auto Check in multiple procedures.  It will only
 check-in one causing the user to have to perform manual check-ins for
 the other procedures.  
   
 Resolution: #1
 --------------
 Routine MDWOR will be modified to allow multiple procedures with 
 different clinics to Auto Check-in.
      
      
 2) INC000000626367  Patch 23 documentation error
      
 Problem: #2
 -----------
 When Patch MD*1*23 was released, the Implementation Guide was not updated
 completely.  There are references to a 'Permissions Button' and 
 instructions on how to use the  'Permissions Button' in the CP Console GUI
 that no longer exists. 
      
 Resolution: #2
 --------------
 A new copy of the Implementation Guide is being released with this patch 
 with the references to the 'Permissions Button' removed.
      
   
 3) INC000001007464  Clinical Procedures - Auto Check-in
  
 Problem: #3
 -----------
 During data entry in menu Auto Study Check-In Setup [MD AUTO CHECK-IN 
 SETUP] option, if the user attempts to use an "^" (up-caret)  to exit the
 option during a Procedure/Clinic lookup, an UNDEF (Undefined) error will
 occur at E1+1^MDWSETUP.
      
 Resolution: # 3
 ---------------
 A modification will be made in routine MDWSETUP to read the "^" (up-caret) 
 and then exit without an error.
      
  
 4) INC000000590845  interface image vault - Tucson
  
 Problem: #4
 -----------
 During the Release of patch MD*1.0*23, an interface routine was not 
 included with the patch distribution by mistake.  This routine, MDHL7M3, 
 needs to be available for sites if they plan to use a GE Image Vault
 Electrocardiogram Storage Device.
      
 Resolution: #4 
 --------------
 Routine MDHL7M3 will be included for distribution with this patch.
