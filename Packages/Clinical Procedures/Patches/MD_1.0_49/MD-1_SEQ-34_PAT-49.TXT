Subject: CP USER GUI 2FA IMPLEMENTATION

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will update the log in procedure to the Clinical Procedures
 (CP) User Graphical User Interface (GUI) to use Two Factor Authentication
 (2FA) which will require the use of a Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
 card.
  
 In order to make the transition to 2FA, it was also necessary to upgrade
 the CP User GUI to Delphi version XE8 in order to implement the new
 Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker allowing compliance.
  
 NOTE: Patch MD*1.0*49 includes a new GUI executable.
  
 NOTE: Sites using a VistA Linux System will only require users to enter 
       access and verify codes on initial log in and PIV PIN after that
       (within 15 minutes). Sites using a VistA VMS System may require
       users to enter both the PIV PIN and Access and Verify codes to
       access the applications.

 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 The Department of Veterans Affairs Cybersecurity Task Force has been tasked 
 by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Inspector General (IG) to 
 address identified material weaknesses. This task force has mandated that 
 all internal, user facing VA applications become two factor authentication
 (2FA) compliant by April 30, 2017. 
  
 In order to be compliant, applications are required to authenticate users 
 via Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards.  
  
 Note: Usernames and password will no longer be permitted for employees and
 contractors to access VA applications.  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 As part of the transition to 2FA, Clinical Procedures (CP User) was upgraded
 to Delphi XE8 to allow access to the latest version of the RPC Broker 
 implementing 2FA.
  
    ========== Software Retrieval and Installation ==========
 Please refer to the "Clinical Procedures Installation Guide" for 
 installation and set-up information. This document is available on the VA 
 Software Document Library (VDL).
  
    ========== Manual Software Retrieval and Installation =========
 The following software file is exported as part of this patch:
  
     File Name                 Contents                 Retrieval Format
     ----------------------    ---------------          ----------------
     MD_1_49_CPUSER.ZIP        CP User Compressed       BINARY
                               ZIP file
  
 NOTE: The file must be transferred using the binary (BIN) file transfer 
       mode. The size of the file, once downloaded, will be 1,196 KB.
     
 When the MD_1_49_CPUSER.ZIP file is extracted, the following files
 will need to be copied to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Vista\Clinical
 Procedures. (This needs elevated privileges),
  
     File Name           Contents                 
     ----------------    -------------------------------------

     CPUSER.GID          CP User Help general index (11 kb)
     CPUSER.hlp          CP User Help file (44 kb)
  
 The file listed above may be obtained via SFTP. The preferred method
 is to SFTP the files from:
  
     download.vista.domain.ext
  
 This transmits the files from the first available SFTP server.  Sites may
 retrieve the software and directly using Secure File Transfer Protocol
 (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following OI Field
 Offices:
