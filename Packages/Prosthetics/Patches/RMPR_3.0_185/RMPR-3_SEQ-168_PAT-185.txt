Description:
============

 This patch enhances VistA Prosthetics (RMPR) without having any
 impact on existing Prosthetics Graphical User Interface (GUI) software.
 This patch restores functionality that was removed from the roll and 
 scroll (aka command-line interface) by patch RMPR*3.0*130. This 
 revised option will allow Prosthetics end-users to select an
 Integrated Funds Control, Accounting, and Procurement (IFCAP) 
 Purchase Request (form 2237) by its Obligation Number, and post the 
 individual line items of that request to individual patients' 
 prosthetics 2319 (record of prosthetics appliance repair) and
 link them to existing prosthetics suspense record for those patients.
 Because the Prosthetics GUI interface is not being modified, existing
 methods for making these purchases will remain and can be used as
 needed.
  
 This patch includes the following to support sites in implementing the 
 ability to record IFCAP 2237 line items into patient 2319 records.
  
   1. added new option, Record eCMS/IFCAP 2237 Purchase to 2319 
      [RMPR ECMS 2237]
   2. restoration and modification of routine, RMPR37, previously 
      removed by patch RMPR*3.0*130.
   3. modification to existing routine, RMPR37A
   4. added two new data fields added to RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR 
      file [#660],
         a) (#41) ECMS ACTIONUID [5;2] and
         b) (#42) UNIQUE ITEM ID [5;3].
   5. existing ICRs (DBIAs) with IFCAP were maintained. 
    
 The new option, RMPR ECMS 2237, is exported as an Option on the 
 Purchasing menu [RMPR PURCHASING MENU] which is descendent from both the 
 RMPR CLERK menu and the RMPR OFFICIAL menu.
