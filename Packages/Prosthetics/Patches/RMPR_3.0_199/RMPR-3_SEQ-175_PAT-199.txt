 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
  
 1.  INC2096056 - No open sequence # message does not display 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Associated end user does not get the warning message, "<<NO>> open
 sequence number available for ### for transaction entry", when creating an
 eyeglass order using the 2914 Eyeglass Record [RMPR 2914 - EYEGLASS] menu
 option and selecting an Obligation that has used all 9999 sequence
 numbers. Also, the warning message letting the user know they are
 running out of sequence numbers quickly scrolls on the screen, and
 is not visible to the user unless they screen up on the VistA screen.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine RMPR21 was modified to write the "<<NO>> open sequence number
 available for ### for transaction entry" when the Obligation 
 number is out of sequence numbers. Also, the software will now pause
 after writing the warning messages to the screen, and require the user
 to hit <Enter> to continue.

 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------------
 Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option.  The message containing the 
 backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at 
 the Message Action prompt.  The PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE is 
 then used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA system.
