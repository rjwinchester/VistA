Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_Prod_Overview_Guide_Groups_5_6_7.pdf) posted on the 
 Anonymous directory for installation order. This is critical for proper
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the ICD-10 activation date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
 systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
 which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research. 
  
 The following functionality within the Prosthetics application were 
 updated to address the ICD-10 code set. These updates apply to both the
 VistA Prosthetics Roll & Scroll application and the Prosthetics 
 Graphical User Interface (GUI) application; there will be a separate
 section listing the updates for each of these interfaces.
  
  
 ===============================  WARNING  ================================
  
 The ICD-10 Class I Remediation project will update VistA to include the
 ICD-10 Diagnosis and Procedure codes. The first patches to be delivered
 by this project will be the STS patches ICD*18.0*57 and LEX*2.0*80 which 
 will include both the ICD-10 Diagnosis and Procedure codes along with new
 or updated APIs that will be used by the other VistA applications to
 select, retrieve and display these new codes.
  
 There are several VistA applications that do not currently utilize code
 set versioning. Those applications are Prosthetics, Home Based Primary
 Care, and Lab Anatomic Pathology. As a result, these applications
 currently allow inactive ICD-9 codes to be displayed and selected for
 ICD-9 dates of service.
  
 During the interim, after the installation of the STS ICD-10 Class I
 Remediation patches and prior to the ICD-10 Implementation date
 (10/01/2015), these applications will also allow the display and
 selection of inactive ICD-10 codes including statuses of (Inactive) or
 (Pending). The users of these applications should use CAUTION to select
 ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes that are appropriate and active.
  
 The following examples show how the software would appear in these
 applications:
  
 EXAMPLE #1: Inactive ICD-9 codes.
 The warning (Inactive) appears at the end of the short description.
  
 ICD-9 DIAGNOSIS CODE: 100.81// 488.

  Select 1-3:
  
  
 When creating or editing records dated after the ICD-10 Activation Date
 (10/01/2015), the software will correctly screen out both the inactive
 ICD-9 and inactive ICD-10 codes.

 PROSTHETICS ROLL & SCROLL
 =========================
  
 1. Add/Edit Home Oxygen Patient
  Full Menu Path: Home Oxygen Main Menu -> Add/Edit Home Oxygen Patient
  
  The software has been updated to determine the active coding system
  based on Date Of Interest, which is the Home Oxygen Prescription Date.
  Once the active coding system is determined, the software will respond in
  one of two ways:
   
   1. If the ICD-9 coding system is active, the software will continue to 
      function as it always has for the ICD-9 code set. This includes 
      Look-ups, searches, and displayed information.
  
   2. If the ICD-10 coding system is active, the software will utilize new 
      Application Program Interfaces (APIs) to perform the Look-ups and 
      searches. Because of the increased granularity of the ICD-10 code
      set, searches may return more matches than can be displayed on a
      single screen.
  
 For the ICD-10 active coding system, the user can enter any of the 
 following:
   1. A valid ICD-10 code.
   2. A partial ICD-10 code.
   3. A partial description of a valid ICD-10 code.
  
  If the user selects a valid ICD-10 code, the software will continue to 
  the next function.
  
  If the user selects one partial ICD-10 code (i.e., a branch node denoted 
  by a trailing "-" ), all of the immediate descendants of that branch 
  node will be displayed to the user. This step will repeat until the user
  selects a valid ICD-10 code.
  
  The user can enter any of the following:
    1. A valid ICD-10 code.
    2. A partial ICD-10 code.
    3. A partial description of a valid ICD-10 code.
  
  The example below shows the new ICD-10 search API drilling down two
  levels to select a valid ICD-10 code.
   
   Step #1: The user enters first three characters (F14) of a valid ICD-10
            code.
    Result: The software then displays the total number of entries that
            match the three character input (20), a numbered list of
            matching codes, their descriptions, and designates leaf nodes
            matches.
  
   Step #2: The user reviews the list and selects entry #4 (F14.15-), which
            is a branch node.
    Result: The software then displays the total number of entries that
            match the partial ICD-10 code F14.15, a numbered list of
            matching code(s), their descriptions, and whether the entry is
            a branch (-) or a leaf node. In this example, there are three
            matches and all three of them are valid ICD-10 codes (no "-" at
            the end of the code).
  
   Step #3: The user reviews the list and selects entry #2 (F14.151),
            which is a valid ICD-10 code.
    Result: The software stores the selected ICD-10 code and advances to 
            the next field in the edit list.
    
    Example noting just the fields immediately before and after the ICD 
    field:

     REMARKS: 
     ITEM TYPE:
     Select FUND CONTROL POINT:
  
  
  The Add/Edit Home Oxygen Patient option has also been updated so that 
  if the user selects an existing Item and that Item contains an ICD code
  which was inactive based on the Start Date of the currently selected
  prescription, the software will issue a warning and then prompt the user
  with options on how to proceed.
  
  The user has three options:
   1) Select a different item with no ICD code or with an active ICD code.
   2) Enter a new item.
   3) Proceed with this item. If the user proceeds with this item, the 
      existing ICD Diagnosis code will be DELETED. The user may then enter
      an active ICD Diagnosis code or they may leave the ICD Diagnosis
      field blank.
  
  
 2. Appliance Transactions 
  
  Accessed through the following menu paths:
  
  PROSTHETIC OFFICIAL'S MENU -> Suspense -> Suspense Processing -> Display 
  2319 -> Appliance Transactions 
  
  Prosthetic Official's Menu -> Process Form 2529-3 -> 2529-3 Request Menu 
  -> Create 2529-3 Request and screen#4 -> Appliance Transactions (show 
  full entry)
  
  Prosthetic Official's Menu Option -> Purchasing -> Enter New Request ->

  and screen#4 -> Appliance Transactions (show full entry)
  
  Prosthetic Official's Menu Option -> Purchasing -> Stock Issues -> Issue 
  from Stock -> and screen#4 -> Appliance Transactions (show full entry)
  
  Prosthetic Official's Menu Option -> Home Oxygen Main Menu -> Billing 
  Transactions-> Display 2319 action and screen#4 - > Appliance
  Transactions (show full entry).
  
  These options have been updated to determine the active coding system 
  based on the Date of Interest, which is the Home Oxygen Prescription 
  Date, and will then retrieve the necessary information and display it to
  the user.
  
  If the ICD-9 coding system is active, the software will continue to 
  function as it always has for the ICD-9 code set.
  
  If the ICD-10 coding system is active, the software will utilize new APIs
  to retrieve and display the needed information.
  
  Due to the granularity of the ICD-10 code set, most of the Diagnosis 
  descriptions are longer than the ICD-9 code set Diagnosis descriptions.
  When an ICD Description is too long to fit on a single line, the
  remainder of the description will be displayed on a second line, which
  will be indented two spaces to denote that this information is related to
  the preceding line.
  
  There is a possibility that the ICD code being displayed may have been 
  inactive on the Date of Interest. In these instances, the software 
  displays an alert message after the Diagnosis description and this alert 
  may wrap onto the next line if the Diagnosis description is too long.
  To avoid this wrapping and to make the display more readable, the
  software has been updated to check the length of the information being
  displayed; if all of the alert information will not fit onto a single
  line, the entire warning will be displayed on the following line and will
  be indented two spaces to denote that the information is related to the
  previous line.
  
  The following is an example of this warning and indentation:

 PROSTHETICS GUI
 ===============
  
 1. RPC Broker Calls
  
  The following RPC broker calls were updated to support the Delphi front-
  end of Prosthetics:
  
  1. Appliance Transaction Detail
     RPC: RMPR TRANS LIST EXPANDED
     Routine: EN^RMPR9S4E
     Notes: The client was updated to look for the code set value (9, 10,
     etc.) as the second caret-delimited "^" piece of array element
     RESULTS(49).
  
  
  2. NPPD Detail Display
     RPC: RMPR NPPD LIST X
     Routine: EN^RMPR9LN1
     Notes: This RPC populates the three dropdown lists from which the user
     picks for the optional custom data fields. The list contains the field
     description and the field number that is sent to the RMPR NPPD LIST
     remote procedure below.
  
     The description was changed from "Suspense ICD-9" to "Suspense ICD" 
     to fit with either code set.
  
     RPC: RMPR NPPD LIST
     Routine: EN^RMPR9LNP
     Notes: The remote procedure returns the ICD code in either piece 19,
     20, or 21 of the results string. The client has been updated to look
     for a tilde "~" as a secondary delimiter to separate the ICD and the
     code set value (9, 10, etc.) for pieces 19, 20 and 21.
  
     Research was done regarding the use of the tilde and it was confirmed
     that the tilde was safe to use as a delimiter.
  
  3. View Prosthetic Billing Information
     RPC: RMPR PFFS LIST
     Routine: EN^RMPRPFFS
     Notes: The client was updated to look for the code set value (9, 10,
     etc.) as the second caret-delimited  "^" piece of array element
     RESULTS(49).
  
  
 2. User Interface changes
  
  1. The appliance detail form of the Prosthetics GUI will reflect whether
     the ICD description is ICD-9 or ICD-10 on the field description 
     label.

 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as 
 follows:
  
 OIFO               FTP ADDRESS                  DIRECTORY
 ------------       ------------------------     ------------------
