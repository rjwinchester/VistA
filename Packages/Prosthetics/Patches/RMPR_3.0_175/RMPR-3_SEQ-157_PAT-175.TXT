 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1)INC000000387983   SITE NUMBER incorrect in OWL Screen
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Currently, the code to populate the NPPD Station Site Number 
 pulls the STATION field (#1) from the RMPR SITE PARAMETER 
 file (#669.9) which is a pointer to the INSTITUTION file (#4) 
 and not the actual station number.
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 After retrieving the pointer to the INSTITUION file (#4), code will
 resolve the internal value to the actual Station Number.
  
  
 2)INC000001010845   Prosthetics - GUI Suite:Serial number field
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 The SERIAL NBR (#9) field in the RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR (#660) 
 file, which allow up to 20 characters, populates the Serial Number box, 
 which is restricted to 15 characters, so that records populated through 
 the Prosthetics GUI with Serial Numbers exceeding 15 characters are being 
 truncated.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Expand the Serial Number box and the field definition in the Prosthetics 
 GUI to allow up to 20 characters for the Serial Number.
  
  
 3)INC000000436417   Prosthetics GUI - Number of Bids field
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 While creating a purchase order, when a value is entered into the 
 "Number of Bids" field, it fails to save.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The current save logic is incorrect, in that it attempts to save when it
 is less than or equal to zero.  The save logic will be modified so that 
 it saves when the value is greater than zero.
  
  
 4)INC000001081023   Prosthetics - GUI Suite:
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 The main menu form for Prosthetics does not set to allow resizing or
 minimization.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Change the Border Style property of the Prosthetics Menu to allow for
 resizing and minimization.
  
   
 5)INC000000302837 - Two purchasing agents are able to order the same
  prosthetics simultaneously for the same consult.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 While on the Purchase Order form, multiple purchasing agents are able
 to access and order against the same consult.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 As soon as the consult has been accessed, it will be locked to prevent
 multiple orders from being linked to the same consult.
  
 ROUTINE: RMPRGULK
  
 6)I6772473FY16  Prosthetic Suite Help File not working 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Users are unable to access the help menu from the main form because the
 filename distributed with the application does not match the help
 file referenced in the code.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Redistribute the relevant helpfile with the name corrected.
   
 OTHER COMPONENTS:
 ================= 
 The following two REMOTE PROCEDURES were created and will 
 be exported with the patch to assist with the locking and unlocking
 of the PROSTHETIC SUSPENSE file (#668) records.

 **Additionally, the above Remote Procedure Calls have been added to
 the PROSTHETICS PURCHASE ORDER GUI [RMPR PURCHASE ORDER GUI]  
 option which will be exported with this patch in order to allow
 users to access the Purchase Order GUI front-end Remote Procedure
 Calls.
  
  
 SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION DISTRIBUTION:
 ======================================== 
 Sites may retrieve the new GUI and documentation directly via Secure File 
 Transfer Protocol (SFTP). The preferred method is to SFTP the files from:
  
        download.vista.domain.ext
  
 This transmits the files from the first available SFTP server.  
  
 Sites may also elect to retrieve the file directly from the
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory from a specific server as follows:
  
   OI FIELD OFFICE          FTP ADDRESS                  DIRECTORY

 GUI Installation Instructions
 =============================
  
 1) Once the executable has been retrieved right click on the zip file 
    and select "Extract All.".
  
 2) Select the location to unzip the file to and click "Extract".
  
 3) Once the file has been unzipped, navigate to the directory where the
    file was placed and run the "Prosthetics_Suite_3_175.exe" executable.
  
 4) If a prior version of the GUI exists on your system, the first time
    through it will remove the old GUI and all related files.  Once the
    old files are removed you will have to run the 
    "Prosthetics_Suite_3_175.exe" executable again to install the new files.
  
 *If no prior versions of the GUI exist it will only be necessary to run
 the "Prosthetics_Suite_3_175.exe" once.
