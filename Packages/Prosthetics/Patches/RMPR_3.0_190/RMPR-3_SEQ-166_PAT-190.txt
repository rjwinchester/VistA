 CA SDM Overview:
 ================ 
 1) I16190621FY17 - Home Oxygen posted charges not displaying when 
                    displaying HO charges for patient
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site reports that when using option Display/Print Patient 2319 [RMPR
 PRINT 2319] they do not see recently posted Home Oxygen billing items
 posted during the monthly option Billing Transactions [RMPO BILLING 
 TRANSACTIONS].
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modification made to the Billing Transactions [RMPO BILLING TRANSACTIONS]
 option processing to ensure a date is connected to the selected vendor in
 HOME OXYGEN TRANSACTIONS (#665.72) file. The vendor date setting has
 been affected by the recent FileMan update concerning %DT(0) handling. 
 Corrections will be made to billing from May 2017 to present.
