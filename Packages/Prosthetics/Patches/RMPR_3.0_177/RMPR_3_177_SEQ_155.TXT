Description:
============

 In preparation for the VA's transition from Internet Protocol version 4 
 (IPv4) to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), the Prosthetics package will

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1) INC000001112135 PROSTHETICS IPV6 CONVERSION 
  
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the latest version of the Internet 
 Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification
 and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across 
 the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force 
 (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address 
 exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4.
  
 The VistA  Prosthetics package is only compatible with IPv4 currently and 
 this effort is to prepare for IPv6 compatibility.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 As part of the transition for Prosthetics, the PROSTHETICS SITE 
 PARAMETERS FILE (#669.9), DVN IP ADDRESS field (#12) will be modified 
 like so:
