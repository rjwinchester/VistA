Subject: PROSTHETICS AND PROSTHETICS BILLING GUI 2FA IMPLEMENTATION

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch will update the log in procedure to the Prosthetics GUI to use 
 Two Factor Authentication (2FA) which will require the use of a Personal 
 Identity Verification (PIV) card.
  
 In order to make the transition to 2FA, it was also necessary to upgrade 
 the Prosthetics GUI to Delphi version XE8 to implement the new Remote 
 Procedure Call (RPC) Broker allowing compliance.
  
 RMPR*3*183 does not update any VistA routines but does update the 
 Prosthetics GUI.

 CA SDM OVERVIEW:
 ================
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 The Department of Veterans Affairs Cybersecurity Task Force has been tasked 
 by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Inspector General (IG) to 
 address identified material weaknesses. This task force has mandated that 
 all internal, user facing VA applications become two factor authentication
 (2FA) compliant by April 30, 2017. 
  
 In order to be compliant, applications are required to authenticate users 
 via Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards.  
  
 Note: Usernames and password will no longer be permitted 
 for employees and contractors to access VA applications.  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Prosthetics GUI has been upgraded to Delphi XE8 to allow access to 
 the latest version of the RPC Broker, implementing 2FA.
  
 SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION DISTRIBUTION:
 ======================================== 
 Sites may retrieve the new GUI and documentation directly via Secure File 
 Transfer Protocol (SFTP). The preferred method is to SFTP the files from:
  
        download.vista.domain.ext
  
 This transmits the files from the first available SFTP server.  
  
 Sites may also elect to retrieve the file directly from the
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory from a specific server as follows:
  
   OI FIELD OFFICE          FTP ADDRESS                  DIRECTORY

 GUI Installation Instructions
 =============================
 The Prosthetics GUI client software is being distributed as a self-
 extracting Install Shield executable. The file installs applications
 included in the VistA Prosthetics Suite v. 3.0.183 (with a size of 6893KB)
 and ProsBillingMenu.exe version 3.0.184 with a size of 3139KB)
  
 1) Once the executable has been retrieved right click on the zip file 
    and select "Extract All.".
  
 2) Select the location to unzip the file to and click "Extract".
  
 3) Once the file has been unzipped, navigate to the directory where the
    file was placed and run the "Prosthetics_Suite_3_183.exe" executable.
  
 4) If a prior version of the GUI exists on your system, the first time
    through it will remove the old GUI and all related files.  Once the
    old files are removed you will have to run the 
    "Prosthetics_Suite_3_183.exe" executable again to install the new files.
  
 *If no prior versions of the GUI exist it will only be necessary to run
 the "Prosthetics_Suite_3_183.exe" once.
  
 5) During installation, if you wish to install the Prosthetics Billing
    Suite, on the "Prosthetics Main Menu Setup" screen you must select
    "Custom" and select "Billing Application" as a component of the
    installation.
