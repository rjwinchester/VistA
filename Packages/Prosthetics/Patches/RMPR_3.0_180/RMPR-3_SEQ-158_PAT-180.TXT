 Ticket Overview:
 ================ 
 1)  I7202994FY16 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Analysis found that when associating a new item with a prescription on
 a Home Oxygen patient, users are able to link an inactive Healthcare 
 Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code to the item.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications were made to the HCPCS query (in template) to never allow 
 an inactive HCPCS linked to an item.  Users will always be asked to 
 enter an active HCPCS. 
  
  
  Routines: RMPOPED
  
  
  
 2) R7259735FY16 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Patient Notification Processing was installed nationally, but never
 approved for processing.  Previously some of the components were removed
 but not all of them.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The remaining components (4 routines and 1 option) associated with the
 defunct Patient Notification Letter processing will be removed.
  
  
  Routines: RMPRDVN, RMPRDVN1, RMPRDVN2, RMPRDVN3 [ALL DELETED]
            RMPRTDEL (Removes tasked option: RMPR DVN NIGHTLY JOB)
  
  Option:  RMPR DVN NIGHTLY JOB  [DELETED]
  
  
 3) I8368381FY16  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When users try to run the Home Oxygen (HO) 'New Patient' report they are 
 receiving an undefined error.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications were made to the HO New Patient report to set the deceased
 patient counter to zero.
  
  
 Routine: RMPORNQ
  
  
 4) I8215214FY16 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Prosthetics users have the ability to enter Product Model or Contract
 # for an order when using the GUI suite for Prosthetics ordering. 
 However, they cannot edit the resultant 2319 in the Vista Prosthetics
 Edit 2319 option [RMPR EDIT 2319]. These fields can be found in the RECORD
 OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR File [#660], PRODUCT MODEL field [#9.2] and
 CONTRACT field  [#38.7].
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the Edit 2319 option [RMPR EDIT 2319] to include the Product Model
 and Contract Number fields to be edited. This will greatly assist staff in
 the recall process in determining correctly identified model numbers and
 ensure the correct contract has been posted for item.
