 1. INC1531325 - <UNDEFINED>F+2^DIED *RMPRSITIEN
                   
    Problem:
    --------
    When an Inter-Facility Consult (IFC) Subscriber Protocol (GRMC IFC
    SUBSC) is triggered, an undefined error is received when a Prosthetics
    Inter-Facility Consult (IFC) is discontinued. This error occurs
    because the Internal Entry Number (IEN) is not defined.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine RMPRFC3 has been modified so value for the institutions IEN is 
    being set to the correct value prior to the use. The institutions IEN 
    will be used for both New and Discontinued Inter-Facility Consults.
  
  
 2. INC1880108 - UNDEFINED>RECON+4^PRCH7C ^PRC(442
                   
    Problem:
    --------
    An undefined error is being received when a Prosthetics Reconcile/Close
    Out Purchase Card Transaction [RMPR4 CLOSE OUT] menu option,
    is attempted, but the Purchase Order in the PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING
    TRANSACTIONS (#442) file has been purged.
    
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The routine RMRR4E21 has been modified so the PROCUREMENT & 
    ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS (#442) file is checked prior to a Reconcile 
    on an order. A message will appear to inform the user the Purchase
    Order does not exist in file so it cannot be Reconciled.

 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------
 Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option. The message containing the 
 backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at 
 the Message Action prompt.  The PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE is 
 then used to install the backed-up routines onto the VistA system.
