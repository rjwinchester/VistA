Subject: UNDEFINED STATION CAUSING ERROR IN SUSPENSE PROCESSING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When jumping to Suspense Processing [RMPR SUSP MENU] from the current 
 option/menu, a site station may be undefined. The option entry point was 
 modified to check for station parameters and ensure that all required 
 fields are defined, and, if not, call the station setup functionality.

 CA-SDM Overview:
 ===============
 1. R16621509FY17 - <UNDEFINED>RMPRPAT2+15^RMPRPAT2 *RMPR("STA")
  
 Problem:
 =======
 During proactive error trap review after RMPR patch installs, sites are 
 receiving errors related to undefined or missing station. Analysis found 
 an additional site parameter was also undefined (besides the initial 
 parameter fixed in patch RMPR*3.0*189) when jumping from a particular 
 option/menu directly to Suspense Processing [RMPR SUSP MENU].
  
 Resolution:
 ==========
 Modified code in RMPREO to check if RMPR("STA") is defined; if not, call 
 DIV4^RMPRSIT to define it.
