 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1) INC000001236630 - Problem with Home Oxygen Generate Letters 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Analysis found two issues with the Home Oxygen Generate Letters process. 
 For integrated sites the compiling uses an incorrect station check and 
 will pull all patients from all stations.  Also, the New list generation
 differs from the Original list generation allowing the displayed/checked
 prescription to use the first or last script on file.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications made to the Generate Letters processing to ensure the 
 station check is functional for integrated sites.  Also, ensure both the
 New list generation and the Original list use the last Home Oxygen
 prescription on patient's record.

 2) INC000001246405 - Home Oxygen deceased patient issue 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Home Oxygen Billing report compilation will ignore patient billing if
 the inactivation date is set (if patient deceased), but a deceased 
 patient (prior to billing month) would still be billed for last script if
 inactivation was not set for patient.
  
 Also, it was determined it would be very helpful to keep the billing 
 compilation more accurate by including patient deceased flag in the 
 various Home Oxygen reports.
  
    Alphabetical List Home Oxygen Patients (by site)
    Active Home Oxygen Patients (Alpha by Zip Code)
    Prescription Expiration Dates
    Inactive Home Oxygen Patients (by Inactive date)
    Monthly Home Oxygen Billing
    Prescription Report
    Pre-Billing Discrepancy Report 
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications made to the Home Oxygen billing compilation to skip 
 deceased patients as flagged in the Patient master file.  Also, modify 
 the various Home Oxygen supporting reports to assist staff in insuring
 the Home Oxygen patients are up-to-date by flagging deceased patients 
 in the following reports.
  
    Alphabetical List Home Oxygen Patients (by site)
    Active Home Oxygen Patients (Alpha by Zip Code)
    Prescription Expiration Dates
    Inactive Home Oxygen Patients (by Inactive date)
    Monthly Home Oxygen Billing
    Prescription Report

 3) INC000001276370 - List Open Stock Issues report error
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Analysis found that the temporary work file used by the report compiling 
 was not cleared prior to the compile.  Therefore, any previous option 
 that used the same work file and did not clear it would have that data 
 mixed in with the newly compiled data for the Open Stock Issue reporting.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications made to List Open Stock Issues reporting to insure that the 
 temporary work file used to compile the reporting data is killed prior 
 to the report compile.
