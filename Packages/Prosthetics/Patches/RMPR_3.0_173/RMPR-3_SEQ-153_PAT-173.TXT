 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1) INC000000922056 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Sites are allowed to edit an inactive HCPCS item. The only check for 
 an inactive HCPCS item was for the entire HCPCS to be inactive, not a
 defined HCPCS item. If a user entered HCPCS AND Item at the HCPCS query
 there was no check for item status.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modification has been made to also check the PROSTHETICS HCPCS ITEM 
 MASTER FILE (#661.11) for inactive HCPCS items and notify the user if the 
 item is inactive and not editable.
  
  
  Routines: RMPRPIY7
  
  
  
 2) INC000000932492 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Purchase Card orders have never been purged from the PROSTHETICS 1358 file
 [#664] and non P-CARD orders have only been purged if the linked suspense
 record was closed or cancelled.  That means all orders still exist going
 back to 1994, while the corresponding IFCAP orders created have been
 purged through 2005,  always keeping the previous 8 years.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to RMPRCDP to include purge process for all 
 orders in the PROSTHETICS 1358 file [#664] where an order will be deleted
 if previously purged from the IFCAP PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS
 File [#442]. Therefore, the purge criteria will be guided by the same
 purge criteria used for IFCAP annual purging where the order information
 is kept for the previous 8 years.
  
 Also, new option Purge Aged Purchasing Transactions [PAG] was added to the
 PURGE OBSOLETE DATA [PGE] menu, like so:
  
 Select Utilities <TEST ACCOUNT> Option: PGE  Purge Obsolete Data
  
  
    PAG    Purge Aged Purchasing Transactions   <<<
    PCL    Purge Closed Purchasing Transactions
    PCX    Purge Cancelled Transactions
    PSU    Purge Suspense Records

 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 ========================
  
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
      download.vista.domain.ext, which will transmit the files from the
      first available FTP server.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from the 
      ANONYMOUS SOFTWARE DIRECTORY from a specific server as follows:
  
      Albany          ftp.domain.ext
      Hines           ftp.domain.ext
      Salt Lake City  ftp.domain.ext
  
      The documentation distribution includes: 
  
      File Name        Description                      Retrieval Format
      =========        ===========                      ================
      rmpr_3_tm.pdf    Prosthetics Technical Manual     Binary
  
  
  (3) Once released, documentation may be retrieved from VISTA
      Documentation Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address:
      http://www.domain.ext/vdl
