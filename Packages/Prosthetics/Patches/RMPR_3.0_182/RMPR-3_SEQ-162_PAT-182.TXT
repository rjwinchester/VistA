 CA SDM Overview:
 ================ 
 1) I7998157FY16 - Eye glass consults emergency status not coming across 
                   correctly 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site reports that when using Suspense Processing [RMPR SUSP MENU] 
    option and displaying suspense records for selected patient, the STAT
    (Emergency consult) entries are not flagged. 
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modification made to the patient Suspense Processing display for a 
    patient to add flag defining a STAT suspense consult. In addition, a 
    modification was made to the print template used when selecting action 
    VIEW REQUEST to display the suspense status (urgency).
  
    ** Purchase Card manual has been updated to show new screen shots of
       the Consult Emergency Status displaying on the Suspense screen.
  
    ** Suspense manual has been updated to show new screen shots of the
       Consult Emergency Status displaying on the Suspense screen.

 2) I8563498FY16 - Unable to add/edit Lot, Model and Contract Numbers 
                   using option RMPR4Close Out 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The option Reconcile/Close Out Purchase Card Transaction [RMPR4 CLOSE
    OUT] currently allows edit of key fields associated with Purchase Card
    order, but not Lot, Model or Contract Number.  These fields need to be
    editable and accurate to be able to track any item recalls on patient
    orders.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modification has been made to the Reconcile Close Out processing to 
    add new fields Lot, Model and Contract Number to be edited.
  
    ** Purchase Card manual has been updated to show new screen shots of
       the new fields (Lot, Model and Contract Number) displaying on the
       Reconciliation screen for editing purposes, if needed.

 3) I8485427FY16 - <UNDEFINED>HEAD1+5^RMPRFO *RMPRSITE  
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Users are incurring an <undefined> error when entering/jumping to
    Suspense Processing [RMPR SUSP MENU] option due to missing site.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modification have been made to the Suspense Processing [RMPR 
    SUSP MENU] option to insure the site variable is actually defined, not
    simply associated site information.
  
  
  Routine: RMPREO
  
  
 4) R11498855FY17- ROC assign to R01 VISTA for MENU change
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site reports that when using View Prosthetics Item Transactions 
    [RMPR VIEW 2319 READ ONLY] option the ICD codes would display as
    'Invalid Code' followed by 'Inactive Date' message.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modification was made to the ICD9/ICD10 handling when converting an ICD
    pointer to ICD DIAGNOSIS (#80) file to a displayed code, description
    and if code is an ICD9 or ICD10 diagnosis code.

 5) I12085141FY17 - User concerned that amendment is edited but there is 
                    no corresponding entry in file 660 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When two or more users are using the Reconciliation Reconcile/Close 
    Out Purchase Card Transaction  [RMPR4 CLOSE OUT] option and editing
    or adding items, the first user to file/exit will kill off the other
    users working work file which results in the affected items in 
    PROSTHETICS 1358 (#664) file not having a corresponding link in RECORD
    OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR (#660) file and any new items not created in
    RECORD OF PROS APPLIANCE/REPAIR (#660) file.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Analysis found that exiting Reconcile/Close Out Purchase Card 
    Transaction  [RMPR4 CLOSE OUT] option was killing off the files in 
    ^TMP("RM",$J) and did not have a $J associated with the kill
    (K ^TMP("AM")).  When multiple users are using the same option,
    the first user to file and exit, will kill off the other user's temp 
    work files. A change was made to the exit kill to add the job number
    ($J) of the user.
