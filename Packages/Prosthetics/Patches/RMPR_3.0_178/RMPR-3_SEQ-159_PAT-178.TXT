Subject: RMPR*3*178 NSR20140206: USE OF GIP IN PROSTHETICS

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The NSR20140206 (Use of GIP in Prosthetics) intake requests the use of the 
 Generic Inventory Package (GIP) functionality in VistA to track Prosthetic 
 inventory.  This patch provides enhanced features to the 
 Prosthetics package so that the Prosthetics Department can use the Generic 
 Inventory Package (GIP) instead of the Prosthetic Inventory 
 Package (PIP) to track prosthetics inventory.
  
 VA sites that make the transition to GIP prosthetics tracking 
 will be able to use a new stock posting option that will 
 automatically suppress the posting of a prosthetic issuance in 
 GIP, depending on whether the site is using a Point-Of-Use 
 (POU) or other system outside of VistA to update the inventory. 
  
 EXCEPTION:
  Sites using DynaMed will be required to continue to use
 Prosthetics Inventory Package and not transition prosthetics inventory to 
 GIP until a solution is implemented that supports GIP and DynaMed.
  
 Note:  This patch does NOT provide instructions to sites for transitioning 
 inventory from PIP to GIP.
  
 This patch includes the following to support sites in implementing the use 
 of GIP for prosthetic inventory tracking.
  
   1. new option, Generic Inventory (GIP) Stock Issues--[RMPR GIP STOCK]
   2. modifications to existing routines RMPKSTK and RMPRSTL
   3. a post-install routine RMPR178P
   4. use of a new Database Integration Agreement (DBIA) #6374
   5. use of an existing DBIA #10085
   6. use of existing Prosthetics Site Parameter [AUTOMATED INVENTORY[GIP)]
  
 The new option--Generic Inventory (GIP) Stock Issues--[RMPR GIP STOCK], 
 provides the capability to issue prosthetics stock that
 is maintained by the IFCAP Generic Inventory Package (GIP).  This option 
 will automatically update inventory in IFCAP GIP.  However, when the items 
 issued are from an INVENTORY POINT that is linked to a Point of Use (POU) 
 supply cabinet then this option does not update the inventory, since these 
 are special cabinets that automatically update GIP inventory balances, via 
 HL7 messaging, when stock is removed.  This option will also check the 
 DynaMed System Parameter flag to determine if the site is running DynaMed, 
 and if so this option will abort.  Sites using DynaMed should continue to 
 use PIP until a solution is implemented for DynaMed and GIP.
  
 The new option, RMPR GIP STOCK, is exported as a Menu Option on the 
 Purchasing menu [RMPR PURCHASING MENU] which is descendent both the RMPR 
 CLERK menu and the RMPR OFFICIAL menu.

         GIP Stock Issues [RMPR GIP STOCK]
  
  
 The requirements for this NSR are: 
 * VHBAO: NEED3315 Provide the ability for Prosthetics to automatically 
          update a patient's record with the provided prosthetic device. 
 * VHBAO: NEED3316 Provide the ability for Prosthetics to update the 
          Inventory for the prosthetic device.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 This patch includes a post-install routine, RMPR178P, that checks for the 
 existence of a Kernel System Parameter for the Prosthetics package.  Some 
 sites may have received instructions to create this parameter in 
 preparation for this patch.  However, the parameter is not necessary and 
 the post-install routine will remove the parameter if it exists.  The 
 post-install routine RMPR178P can be deleted after installation.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.

 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
  
 Sites currently running PIP for prosthetics inventory will need to 
 coordinate the conversion to GIP for prosthetics inventory.  Sites using 
 DynaMed will not be able to use GIP for Prosthetics inventory at this 
 time.  The post-install routine RMPR178P can be deleted after 
 installation.

The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;3.0;Prosthetics;**[Patch List]**;13/27/08;Build 14

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.

Routine Name: RMPR178P
    Before:       n/a   After: B12159958  **178**
Routine Name: RMPRSTK
    Before: B48665872   After: B62842699  **12,13,16,19,21,26,28,33,41,45,178**
Routine Name: RMPRSTL
    Before: B22270638   After: B24867541  **14,28,33,41,178**
 Description of Changes:
  A new function is added to this routine that determines whether an inventory
  point is linked to an automated supply station (Point of Use Cabinet).  This
  function is supported by DBIA with IFCAP (DBIA 6374 to read IFCAP GIP files). 
  Additionally, logic is added to call existing DBIA to update GIP inventory when
  inventory point is not POU.  When inventory point is POU inventory is not
  updated since this is done through HL7 messaging from the POU inventory
  functionality, when stock is removed.
