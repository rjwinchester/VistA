 1. Rational Defect# 781764- Place Incident Reporting Menu Options "out of
                             order". 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The VHANCPS JPSR TEAM has identified that several Incident Reporting
    menu options are obsolete and no longer in use.  They have requested
    the options listed in this patch be disabled with the message:
    "Disabled-USE Joint Patient Safety Reporting-JPSR".
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The post install routine QAN2P34 has been created to update the OUT 
    OF ORDER MESSAGE field (#2), with, "Disabled-USE Joint Patient Safety 
    Reporting-JPSR".
  
 NOTE: The following list is inclusive and some sites may not have all
 listed options.  There is no cause for concern if your site does not have
 some of these listed options.
