Subject: VSS*5*1 Enhancement Release

Category: 
  - Informational
  - Other
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This is the informational patch for the release of the new 
 Voluntary Service System (VSS) Web application.
  
 RELEASE INFORMATION:
 VSS is a web-based application that provides a central interface for 
 Voluntary Service staff to manage, track, and report on volunteers and 
 donations.
  
 There are no VistA patches required to deploy VSS 5.1
   
 SOFTWARE CHANGES:
 ================
 VSS is a web-based application. Changes will be applied to the 
 production servers and will be immediately available to the users. No 
 changes at the local site are required for this release.
  
 Enhancements & New features
 ============================
 -The 5.1 release has transformed VSS into a Java/Linux application on the 
  front end.  It has been upgraded from SQL Server 2008R2 to SQL Server 
  2012 as the database server.
  
 -VSS 5.1 now uses SQL Server Reporting Server for reporting needs.  
  Crystal Reports has been removed and Reporting is processed on a 
  replicated reporting server that separates transactions from reports.
  This will remove transaction performance problems during heavy reporting
  cycles at month and year end.
  
 -SQL Server Reporting Server supports Ad Hoc reporting by high level users
  through Active Directory groups controlled by the Business Owner.  Ad Hoc
  reporting allows custom reporting to meet business needs not possible in 
  the previous system.
  
 -The VSS Kiosk printing is no longer controlled by IE.  A local console 
  application now runs on each Kiosk that controls printing.  This should 
  greatly reduce Kiosk printing problems related to IE version upgrades and
  VA IE security policies and settings.
  
 -Several Access databases that supplemented the previous system have been 
  integrated into VSS. This includes tracking for National Officials and 
  Program Manager.
  
 -Volunteers & Donors are now shared across facilities.
  Organizations now support branches, and branches can have both time and 
  donations tracked against them.
  
 -Services now support roles for volunteers.  Volunteer time is tracked 
  against the role and can be reported on with finer granularity.
  
  
 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

 SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL:
 ==================
