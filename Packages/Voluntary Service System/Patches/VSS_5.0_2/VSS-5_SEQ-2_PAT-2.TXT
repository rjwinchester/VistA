 functionality released in VSS 5.1. The following enhancements included

 to volunteers based on the role they are filling is available.
  
 -Notifications - The new Notifications section on the VSS Home Page
 provides users the ability to deliver, view, and act upon notifications
 based on pre-defined events such as training due, visa and driver's
 license and insurance expiring, LEIE and more.
  
 -Pay.Gov Interface - VSS will now receive any donations posted to Pay.gov,
 nightly and in real-time for the VSS staff to incorporate into VSS. These
 donations are displayed on the "E-Donations Received" listing available
 from the Donations menu.
