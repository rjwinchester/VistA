Subject: eHMP SURGICAL PROCEDURE FRESHNESS UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch was developed to trigger freshness updates for the eHMP 
 system. Although this patch is for Clinical Procedures, the change that 
 was needed is in a Medicine (MC) routine. This patch places the proper
 trigger to ensure new and updated data for Clinical Procedures are sent to
 the eHMP system.
