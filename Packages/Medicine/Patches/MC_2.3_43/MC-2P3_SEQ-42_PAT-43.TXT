Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_Production_Overview_Guide_Groups_3_4.pdf) posted on the Anonymous 
 directory for installation order. This is critical for proper 
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the implementation date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
 systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
 which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research. 
  
 The following functionality within the VistA Medicine (MC) application was 
 updated to address the ICD-10 code set. Only the Rheumatology Menu [MCRHUSER]
 option is addressed.
  
 1. The Diagnosis Edit [MCRHDIAGF] option was modified such that when a user 
    selects a medical diagnosis, the ICD code that is populated in the
    RHEUMATOLOGY File (#701) is relevant to the ICD code set for the procedure
    date.
  
    -  If the procedure date is prior to the implementation date of the ICD-10
       code set, then the ICD-9 code mapped to the medical diagnosis will be 
       populated.
    -  If the procedure date is on or after the implementation date of the 
       ICD-10 code set, then the ICD-10 code mapped to the medical diagnosis 
       will be populated. 
  
 2. The Diagnosis Print [MCRHDIAGP] and Print All Report [MCRHALLP] options
    under the Print Menu [MCRHMENUPRT] were modified such that the column
    header displays "ICD" instead of "ICD9". 
  
 3. Several field descriptions were updated to replace the word "ICD9" with ICD".
    NOTE: Many of the fields were flagged for future use.
  
 4. The parent package of Medicine, Clinical Procedures (CP), was added as a
    subscriber to several of the APIs as noted in ICR #5747.
   
 5. The following menu option and its sub-menu options on the Rheumatology Menu
    were placed out of order. These options are no longer used within the 
    Medicine package.
          Line Enter/Edit Menu ... [MCRHMENULIN]
            Diagnosis Line Edit [MCRHDIAGL]
            History Narrative Line Edit [MCRHNARRL]
            Health Assessment (HAQ) Line Edit [MCRHHAQL]
            Health/Physical History Line Edit [MCRHPATHISTL]
            Physical Examination Line Edit [MCRHPHYSL]
            Death Admin Line Edit [MCRHDEATHL]
            Brief Diagnosis Line Edit [MCRHBRIEF]
