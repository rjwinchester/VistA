 This release consists of the following enhancements:

 application to both Excel and CSV. Privacy reminders were added regarding

 information. 
 -       Addition of Partner Organization functionality allows VAP 
 administrators to view list of VAP partners, check if a partner is 
 active, edit partner details and view inactive partners. 
 -       Enhancements were made to add workflow for placing a consent in a 
 delayed status due to missing information. Letters can be generated for 
 mailing to Veteran with reasons for delay and information needed, in 
 addition to updates on expiring authorization and revocation consent 
 letters. Reporting features are added to track consents in a delayed 
 status for both summary and detailed level. 
 -       Updates were completed to provide additional reporting options 
 and filters. Additional features include searching by User ID, 
 multi-selection of VISN and facilities in consent reports, filtering by 5 
 digit code facilities, and differentiation in the User Interface (UI) 
 between preferred facility and authenticating facility. The list of 
 facilities within the VAP application was expanded to include 5-digit

 additional columns are parsed from the details column to include User
