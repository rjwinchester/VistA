Subject: VLER eHXE VAP Build 3 (v2.7.2.1)

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Note: Technical support staff at Austin Information Technology Center 
 (AITC) will install this enhancement release on the VAP servers located 
 there using a pre-approved Request for Change Order and Implementation 
 Plan.  This Deployment is scheduled to take place on August 3, 2017 from 
 8:00 PM EST- 11:00 PM EST.
 No effort is required by local sites.  User Acceptance Test is by the 
 direction of the eHealth Exchange Business Owner and no MOUs are required.
 **************************************************************************
 VAP Release 2.7.2.1 contains code changes (enhancements) to the VAP 
 application and service.  These changes are Work Items that were recorded 
 and tracked in the eHealth Exchange Enhancements area (eHXE team also 
 makes changes to VAP as required) of Rational Team Concert, the 
 VA-prescribed tool used for tracking requirements and associated test 
 plans.  This release contains the Work Items completed during production 
 deployment.
 This enhancement release consists of the following enhancements to the 
 VAP system:
 The enhancements for Build 3 (Release 2.7.2.1) are focused on the Data 
 Quality Tool (DQT) Integration Plan and Security Labeling Service (SLS) 
 integration. For DQT, the release includes providing a new user interface 
 to download clinical documents in bulk from the eHX Adapter's audit 
 record. For SLS, the release includes retrieving Continuity of Care 
 Documents (CCDs) from Adapter during authorization policy evaluation 
 (XACML Context Handler), invoking the SLS with that CCD, and updating the 
 XACML request context (sent to SAC) with the resulting patient 
 confidentiality code. It is important to note that the real SLS is not 
 yet available, so the new SLS integration functionality is disabled by 
 default, but can be enabled via a property file change (described below), 
 and that is done in non-production environments only for this release.
