 **************************************************************************
 VAP Release 2.7.4.9 contains code changes (enhancements) to the VAP 
 application and service.  These changes are Work Items that were recorded 
 and tracked in the eHealth Exchange Enhancements area (eHXE team also 
 makes changes to VAP as required) of Rational Team Concert, the 
 VA-prescribed tool used for tracking requirements and associated test 
 plans.  This release contains the Work Items completed during production 
 deployment.
 This enhancement release consists of the following enhancements to the 
 VAP system:
         eHX Adapter sends XML files (inbound and outbound) to Diameter 
 Health (DH - managing team responsible for standing up the DQT and 
 providing authentication tokens to use for server connections). Files 
 sent to DH are single files as the DQT cannot accept zip files.
         eHX Adapter packages files sent to DH in a zip folder and places 
 the zip folder on the Data Quality team server (also referred to as a 
 staging server) for the Data Quality team consumption. 
         A notification is triggered once Adapter completes XML file 
 transmissions to DH and DQ team servers. 
         Standardized DQ zip file naming conventions for internal VA 
 partners/providers and external partners/providers:
 o All VA files in Adapter(for data quality)use the following convention:
 VAMC_DocumentType_DocumentID_YYYYMMDD
 o All files from partners in Adapter use the following convention: 
 PartnerStation_DocumentType_DocumentID_YYYYMMDD
         Created Data Quality Upload Transmission Log Report: this report 
 displays the data logged for the daily, clinical data file upload batch 
 processing, performed by the Adapter Data Quality Services upload 
 application. Batch processing consists of three events, which include: 
 1.Uploading the individual XML file to Diameter Health
 2.Packaging a copy of files sent to DQT in a zip file 
 3.Moving the completed zip file to a shared location for DQ team 
 for consumption
 These data files consist of the clinical health data XML files which have 
 been retrieved via the VA eHX Adapter application, both for inbound VA 
 requests and disclosures to external health partners, are stored in the 
 audit table in the eHX Adapter database. Like other reports in VAP, this 
 new report provides users with the ability to export to excel or csv file 
 format.
         Data Quality Bulk Downloader provides ability to restrict 
 partners/organization to those selected by the user. In addition, the 
 Bulk Downloader page was redesigned to meet 508 compliance standards.
         Health Summary (C-CDA) tab was enhanced using the most current 
 stylesheet, and eHXE remediated the broken button issue (PR.006), and 
 remediated the floating header when viewing C-CDA from Received Documents 
 report.
