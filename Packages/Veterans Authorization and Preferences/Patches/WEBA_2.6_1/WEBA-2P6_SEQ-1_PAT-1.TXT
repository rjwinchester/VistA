Subject: Veteran Authorization and Preferences (VAP) 2.6.0 Release

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 NOTE: Technical support staff at Austin Information Technology Center 
 (AITC) will install the enhancement release 2.6.0 on the NVP (formerly 
 VLER and formerly NHIN) and NHI servers located there using a 
 pre-approved Request for Change Order and Implementation Plan. This 
 deployment is scheduled to take place on January 24, 2017 from 8:00 PM 
 EST - 11:00 PM EST. No effort is required by local sites.  
  
 Veteran Authorization and Enhancements (VAP) Release 2.6.0 contains 
 enhancements to the VAP application and eHealth Exchange (eHX). These 
 changes are Work Items that were recorded and tracked in the Veteran 
 Authorization and Preferences area of Rational Team Concert, the 
 VA-prescribed tool used for tracking requirements and associated test 
 plans. This release contains the Work Items completed during production 
 deployment.
  
 This release consists of the following enhancements:
 -       Retry functionality so that VAP makes additional attempts in the 
 event of a system time-out or non-response with MVI. 
 -       Update the Patient Discovery Audit Detailed report so that the 
 Mother's Maiden Name, and Place of Birth appear in the details column. 
 -       Trigger functionality between eHX and VAP so that new partners, 
 added or updated to eHX, are automatically updated in VAP.
 -       Update the eHX immunization workflow to leverage the VAP Web 
 service for determining if an organization is trusted.
 -       Updates so that exported reports over 1000 rows are downloaded in 
 the background, and the user is able to download exported reports once 
 they have completed processing.
 -       Update the announce functionality so that if a partner does not 
 respond to an announcement, then the non-response is audited.
 -       Update the manage batches pages so that the names of individuals 
 sent in batch announce are listed.
  
 User Acceptance Test (UAT) is by the direction of the VAP Business Owner 
 and no Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) are required.

 Information and Technology (OIT) Software Quality Assurance. The VAP
