Description:
============

 Note: Technical support staff at Austin Information Technology Center 
 (AITC) will install this enhancement release on the VAP servers located 
 there using a pre-approved Request for Change Order and Implementation 
 Plan.  This 
 Deployment is scheduled to take place on June 16, 2017 from 8:00 PM EST
 - 11:00 PM EST.
  
 No effort is required by local sites.  User Acceptance Test is by the 
 direction of the eHealth Exchange Business Owner and no MOUs are required.
 **************************************************************************
 VAP Release 2.7.1 contains code changes (enhancements) to the VAP 
 application and service.  These changes are Work Items that were recorded 
 and tracked in the eHealth Exchange Enhancements area (eHX-E team also 
 makes changes to VAP as required) of Rational Team Concert, the 
 VA-prescribed tool used for tracking requirements and associated test 
 plans.  This release contains the Work Items completed during production 
 deployment.
  This enhancement release consists of the following enhancements to the 
 VAP system:
         New Data Quality Report that allows analysts to access to raw XML 
 for offline quality data analysis.
         SLS Integration Preparation: VAP's policy evaluation service 
 (XACML Context Handler) can now do the following:
 1.      Retrieve a patient health summary from Adapter when required for 
 SLS labeling.
 2.      Submit said health summary to the SLS via web service call when 
 required.
 3.      Enhance the policy evaluation request sent to SAC with a new 
 Patient Confidentiality attribute holding the SLS result.
 4.      Improved logging of policy evaluation and errors.
 Note that as the real SLS is not yet available, and final policies have 
 not been defined, other than logging improvements, the new SLS 
 functionality described above is disabled by default, and will only be 
 enabled in non-production test environments (via configurable setting).
 Test sites: N/A
 The upgraded software will be deployed to a centralized system at AITC.
 Downstream Dependent System Testing: Testing efforts with VAP downstream 
 systems were successful.
 Remedy tickets: None
