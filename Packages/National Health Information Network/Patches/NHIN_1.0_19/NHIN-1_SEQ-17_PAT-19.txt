 The upgraded software will be deployed to a centralized system at AITC.
  
 External Partner Test Sites:
 There are 171 external clinical partners (Clinical Connect, Kaiser 
 Permanente, Walgreens, etc.) who validate releases through normal 
 business operations and report any issues.
  
 For eHXE enhancements testing SOAP UI Scripts mimics partner testing to 
 allow select partners (KP, SSA, MedVA, MHV) to be tested regardless of 
 partner system and resource availability but the majority of partner 
 testing was performed end to end in the test system.
  
 Downstream Dependent System Testing: 
 Testing efforts with MHV, DAS, JLV, VistAWeb, VAP, MVI systems were 
 successful.
