 integration with the VDIF-EP software platform.
  
 eHealth Exchange Phase 2 Build 6 has the following feature:
  
 1 US.18.01.03 Code Changes to support MHV query to HealthShare
  
 Test sites:  CHYSHR and DAYTSHR test Vistas were used in the eHX SQA2
 Environment.  This is a central install at AITC and does not require test
 sites or actions by specific Vistas.
  
 Internal Applications/Dependencies:

 Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV)
 MyHealtheVet (MHV) 
 VistAWeb 
 Veterans Authorizations and Preferences (VAP)
 HealthShare
 Terminology Services

 The upgraded software will be deployed to a centralized system at AITC.
  
  
 External Partner Test Sites:
 There are over 200 external clinical partners (Clinical Connect, Kaiser 
 Permanente, Walgreens, etc.) who validate releases through normal 
 business operations and report any issues.
  
 For eHXE enhancements testing SOAP UI Scripts mimics partner testing to 
 allow select partners (KP, SSA, MedVA, MHV) to be tested regardless of 
 partner system and resource availability but the majority of partner 
 testing was performed end to end in the test system.
  
 Downstream Dependent System Testing: 
 Testing efforts with MHV, DAS, DSM, TS, ESR, JLV, VistAWeb, VAP, 
 MVI systems were successful.
