Subject: VLER eHXE Adapter Build 3 (v7.2.0.6)

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Note: Technical support staff at Austin Information Technology Center 
 (AITC) will install this enhancement release on the eHealth Exchange 
 (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) servers located there using a 
 pre-approved Request for Change Order and Implementation Plan.  This 
 Deployment is scheduled to take place on August 3, 2017 from 8:00 PM EST- 
 11:00 PM EST.
  No effort is required by local sites.  User Acceptance Test is by the 
 direction of the eHealth Exchange Business Owner and no MOUs are required.
 **************************************************************************
 eHealth Exchange (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) Adapter Release 
 7.2.0.6 contains code changes (enhancements) to the eHealth Exchange 
 Adapter module.  These changes are Work Items that were recorded and 
 tracked in the eHealth Exchange area of Rational Team Concert, the 
 VA-prescribed tool used for tracking requirements and associated test 
 plans. This release contains the Work Items completed during production 
 deployment.
 This enhancement release consists of the following enhancements to the 
 eHealth Exchange system:
 The Adapter 7.2.0.6 (build 3) release introduces the Small C-CDA CCD 
 functionality as a way to impose default organizational limits on 
 requests for CCD documents that are submitted without Query Dates, so 
 that the CCDs are limited in content and therefore "smaller" for partners 
 to consume. Architecturally, Adapter was configured to be able to receive 
 and store requesting system information for disclosure and reporting 
 purposes in VAP, as well as significant refactoring of the eHX audit logs 
 to better capture and organize/structure details of all messaging 
 transactions and assignment of a unique transaction ID that can be used 
 to trace all messages related to a single transaction for a patient 
 between VA and a partner. 
 Other advancements were made in the efforts to migrate/back-up the 
 Adapter and VAP audit databases to the VA's Corporate Data Warehouse 
 (CDW) using Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes. The proof of 
 concept is being finalized with the intent to start regular scheduled 
 back-ups of Adapter and VAP audit information with the build 3 production 
 release. Additional changes are in the backlog to determine the process 
 for how and when to archive existing data off of the Adapter and VAP 
 audit tables to free up "live" space that frequently impairs system 
 performance and response times for ROI users.
 Finally, the entire eHX SDD was re-baselined to correctly represent the 
 as-is system design, interfaces, and data flows.
 Test sites: N/A
 The upgraded software will be deployed to a centralized system at AITC.
  External Partner Test Sites: 
         For eHXE enhancements testing SOAP UI Scripts mimics different 
 partner testing. No real world end-to-end testing was performed.
 Downstream Dependent System Testing: Testing efforts with eHX Adapter, 
 VAP, Connect and MVI and downstream systems were successful.
