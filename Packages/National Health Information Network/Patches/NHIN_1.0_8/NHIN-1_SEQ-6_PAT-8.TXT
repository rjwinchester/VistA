 **********************************************************************
   
 eHealth Exchange (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) Adapter Release 
 6.5.0.12 contains code changes (enhancements) to the eHealth Exchange 
 Adapter 
 module.  These changes are Work Items that were recorded and tracked in 
 the eHealth Exchange area of Rational Team Concert (RTC), the 
 VA-prescribed tool used for tracking requirements and associated test 
 plans.
  This release contains the Work Items
 completed during production deployment.
  
 This enhancement release consists of enhancements to both the eHealth 
 Exchange system and the Veteran Authorization and Preferences
 (VAP) system to enable health information exchange
 with the Social Security Administration (SSA), improve the current 
 interaction between Exchange and the Master Veteran Index (MVI) system, 
 and implement enhanced ad hoc reporting in the VAP system.  The 
 high-level enhancements included in this release are as follows:
 - SSA VAP Enhancements: The system will be enhanced to facilitate 
 eAuthorization with SSA by providing the ability to receive and validate 
 an eAuthorization from SSA, update Veteran's authorization preferences 
 based on received eAuthorizations, and display eAuthorization within VAP 
 in a human readable form. 
 - SSA Consolidated Clinicial Document Architecture (C-CDA) Clinical Care 
 Document (CCD) Enhancements: The system shall provide a C-CDA to include 
 new data elements and modified business rules in order to satisfy SSA 
 supporting data requirements for disability adjudication.
 - MVI Enhancements: The system shall be enhanced to make additional 
 attempts if the MVI system times out and be able to update the 
 correlations. A patient discovery message will be implemented every time 
 the system is queried for patient information and the returned 
 correlation information will be updated in the MVI. The Exchange system 
 will be modified to send the patient middle name, place of birth, and 
 mother maiden name as part of a patient discovery message.
 - VAP Ad-hoc Reports: The system shall be enhanced to implement the 
 ability to generate customized ad-hoc reports from existing system and 
 information.
  
 Test sites: N/A
 The upgraded software will be deployed to a centralized system at AITC.
  
 Testing Process: Release 6.5 testing was focused on the CCDA readability 
 enhancements and the retrieval of notes within a specific date range for 
 the Encounters, Surgical Procedures, Discharge Summaries, History and 
 Physicals, Pathology and Consults sections of the CCDA.

 Testing efforts with the Direct, Vistaweb, and MyHealtheVet downstream 
 systems were successful; testing with Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) and 
 Enterprise Health Management Platform (eHMP) was not able to be performed 
 during the testing window due to those systems being unable to connect to 
 the SQA testing environment.
