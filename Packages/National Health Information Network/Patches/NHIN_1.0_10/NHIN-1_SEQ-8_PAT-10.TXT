Subject: VLER eHX Increment 7 Release 1 (v6.6.0.8) Informational Patch

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Note: Technical support staff at Austin Information Technology Center 
 (AITC) will install this enhancement release on the eHealth Exchange 
 (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) servers located there using a 
 pre-approved Request for Change Order and Implementation Plan.  This 
 deployment is scheduled to take place on October 15, 2015 from 8:00 PM EST
 - 11:00 PM EST.
  
 No effort is required by local sites.  User Acceptance Test is by the 
 direction of the eHealth Exchange Business Owner and no MOUs are required.
 **************************************************************************
 eHealth Exchange (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) Adapter Release 
 6.6.0.8 contains code changes (enhancements) to the eHealth Exchange 
 Adapter module.  These changes are Work Items that were recorded and 
 tracked in the eHealth Exchange area of Rational Team Concert, the 
 VA-prescribed tool used for tracking requirements and associated test 
 plans.  This release contains the Work Items completed during production 
 deployment.
  
 This enhancement release consists of the following enhancements to the 
 eHealth Exchange system:
 - Laboratory Data: Microbiology results will be added to the Consolidated 
 Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) CCD provided to external 
 partners.  This will be accessed from VistA via the Accession Virtual 
 Patient Record (VPR) extract.
 - Data Filtering and Security: Additional data filtering will be provided 
 to allow sensitive data to be filtered out (i.e., not provided on the 
 C-CDA) unless the user designates to have sensitive information shared.  
 No user interface will be provided for defining "sensitive" data 
 elements. This capability is considered a proof of concept and will not 
 be enabled in the release of this increment.
 In addition to these two enhancements, two defects identified in 
 Increment 5 (v6.4.0.17) will be addressed and resolved with this release, 
 as follows:
 - A fix to a Release 6.4.0.17 UAT defect which will cause only the 
 Primary Care Provider to have its Addresses displayed
 - A fix to a Release 6.4.0.17 UAT defect which caused Headers to be 
 displayed even if no data was retrieved for that Information block. 
  
 Test sites: N/A
 The upgraded software will be deployed to a centralized system at AITC.
  
 Sensitive or private information is given identifiers in LOINC, VUID, or
 ICD languages in the database, and if the information is restricted by the
 patient, the adapter will filter out this information in clinical
 documents. As of September 2015, this sensitive data filtering
 functionality is not planned for release in production, but may be
 released at a later date.
  
 External Partner Test Sites: Sentara and Multicare were able to 
 successfully pull C-CDA and C32 documents respectively from the system. 
  
 Downstream Dependent System Testing: Testing efforts with the Direct 
 Secure Messaging, VistAWeb, and MyHealtheVet downstream systems were
 successful.
  
 Remedy tickets: None
