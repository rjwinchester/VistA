Subject: VLER eHEALTH EXCHANGE 6.0.2.4 INFORMATIONAL PATCH

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Note: Technical support staff at Austin Information Technology Center
 (AITC) will install this enhancement release on the eHealth Exchange
 (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) servers on January 11, 2015, between
 12:45 AM - 4:00 AM EST, using a pre-approved Request for
 Change Order and Implementation Plan.
  
 No effort is required by local sites.  User Acceptance Test is by the 
 direction of the eHealth Exchange Business Owner and no MOU are required.
 **********************************************************************
   
 eHealth Exchange (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) Adapter Release 6.0.2.4
 contains code changes (enhancements) to the eHealth Exchange Adapter
 module.  These changes are Work Items that were recorded and tracked in
 the eHealth Exchange area of RTC.  This release contains the Work Items
 completed during production deployment. 
  
 This enhancement release enables the Exchange Adapter to be compatible 
 with Healtheway's 2011 specification as well as ensures backward 
 compatibility with Healtheway's 2010 specifications.  This enhancement 
 allows VA eHealth Exchange to onboard additional external partners who 
 are currently 2011 specification-certified and have not been able to 
 conduct health information exchange with the VA due to the lack of 
 compatibility.
  
 The v6.0.2.4 code was certified by Healtheway as meeting the compliance 
 standards of the 2011 specification in November 2014 and needs to be 
 deployed in the eHealth Exchange Production environment in order to 
 initiate the on-boarding of 2011 partners.  In addition to now being able 
 to exchange with 2011 partners, it is critical that backward 
 compatibility with 2010 partners be maintained, since not all partners 
 who currently exchange with VA are 2011 certified.  The Exchange CONNECT 
 gateway subscription will be upgraded to support exchange with 2011 
 specification-certified partners.  The upgraded capability will be 
 backward compatible with eHealth Exchange partners who continue to use 
 the 2010 Healtheway specification.
  
 Test sites - N/A
 The upgraded software will be deployed to a centralized system at AITC.
  
 Testing Process:
  
 Features and Functionality tested in this release to production
 included:
 - 2010/2011 Specification backward compatibility: Tested the inbound and 
 outbound ability to execute patient discovery (PD), document query (DQ), 
 and document retrieve (DR) functionality with partners configured on 
 either 2010 or 2011 specifications to ensure backward compatibility when 
 2011 Specification is rolled out.
 - Immunization Retention: Tested the ability to receive pushed C32 
 documents and store immunization data in VistA via VLER DAS.
  
 Testing was conducted with external partners - both 2011 and 2010 
 partners - to ensure that the upgraded capability allowed for successful 
 exchange with 2011 partners and backward compabitility with 2010 
 partners.  2010/2011 Spec testing was conducted with 5 partners:  Kaiser 
 Permanente (KP), Med Virginia (Med VA), Wright State University, Indiana 
 Health Information Exchange (HIE) and Conemaugh Health Systems.  In 
 addition, a Document Push test was conducted with Walgreens.
  
 Remedy tickets: None.
