Subject: eHXE Adapter Build 4 (v7.3.0.8)

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Note: Technical support staff at Austin Information Technology Center 
 (AITC) will install this enhancement release on the eHealth Exchange 
 (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) servers located there using a 
 pre-approved Request for Change Order and Implementation Plan.  This 
 Deployment is scheduled to take place on October 19, 2017 from 8:00 PM 
 EST- 11:00 PM EST.
 No effort is required by local sites.  User Acceptance Test is by the 
 direction of the eHealth Exchange Business Owner and no MOUs are required.
 **************************************************************************
 eHealth Exchange (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) Adapter 7.3.0 (Build 
 4) release introduces the capability of VA to generate a C-CDA Single 
 Encounter Summary (SES). This new supported document type narrows the 
 scope of a traditional health summary to only include data pertaining to 
 a single encounter, selected by the requesting partner. Several 
 enhancements were also made to the C-CDA XML, including: 
  
         CCM-174: Corrected the use of invalid HTML tags that were 
 previously used to format (bold, italicize) text within the C-CDA 
 documents, to using the compliant <content styleCode> attributes; 
         CCM-035/36/37: Corrected text alignment of tables in the 
 Encounters, Procedures, and Results sections; 
         CCM-225/7: Business rule text throughout the CCD and SES 
 documents (for both standard and MHV versions); 
         CCM-138: Reactivated the C&P MHV filter and implemented an 
 independent configurable hold period;
         CCM-198: Added conditional logic to the Clinical Procedure note 
 hold period for MHV;
         CCM-245: Implemented dynamic use of the typeCode element in the 
 QD response message so SSA can easily parse the new SES document type.
 Architecturally, the Adapter team designed and built a prototype of the 
 new asynchronous orchestration/subscription service that will be used to 
 allow VA clients to subscribe to document feeds for a given patient and 
 notify in real-time as those documents are retrieved and become available 
 for viewing. This prototype was demonstrated successfully to the business 
 stakeholders and will be "shelved" until the DAS client is available to 
 integrate and test the service.
 Finally, the CDW data back-up of the Adapter and VAP audit database 
 tables has been successfully running in production. The next step is to 
 prioritize requirements for how VAP users can access the data stored in 
 CDW via a new or existing reporting interface, and how/when to archive 
 "stale" data from the live Adapter and VAP tables so that the current 
 performance/response issues can be mitigated. 
 Test sites: N/A
 The upgraded software will be deployed to a centralized system at AITC.
  External Partner Test Sites: 
         For eHXE enhancements testing SOAP UI Scripts mimics different 
 partner testing. No real world end-to-end testing was performed.
 Downstream Dependent System Testing: Testing efforts with eHX Adapter, 
 VAP, Connect and MVI and downstream systems were successful.
