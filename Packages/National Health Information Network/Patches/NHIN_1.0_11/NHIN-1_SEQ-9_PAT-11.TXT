 eHealth Exchange (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) Adapter Release 
 6.7.0.11 contains code changes (enhancements) to the eHealth Exchange 
 Adapter module.  These changes are Work Items that were recorded and 
 tracked in the eHealth Exchange area of Rational Team Concert, the 
 VA-prescribed tool used for tracking requirements and associated test 
 plans.  This release contains the Work Items completed during production 
 deployment.
  
 This enhancement release consists of the following enhancements to the 
 eHealth Exchange system:
 - Social Security Administration (SSA) Consolidated Clinical Document 
 Architecture (C-CDA) Data Elements: Enhancements to the VA-generated 
 C-CDA will be made to include additional data elements to support health 
 information exchange with SSA.
  
 Additions have been made to clinical health documents to support 
 communication with SSA. C-CDA and C62 documents will have new 
 capabilities to account for the following data elements: 
 - Demographics including Means Test and Eligibility Code.
 - Global Assessment Functioning (GAF) Date problem resolved.
         * Score taken from the GAF Scale to evaluate the psychological, 
 social, and occupational functioning on a hypothetical continuum 
 of mental health or illness.
         * Date of assessment.
         * Name of health care professional providing score.
 - Discharge Summaries
         *Supply Discharge Summaries in clinical document (CCDA or C62) 
 form; 3 years or 200 occurrences, whichever comes first.
 - Medical Full Report
         * Requirement calls for a full report of procedures (e.g., 
 Electrocardiogram (ECG), Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT), sleep 
 studies) as defined by the Medicine View file.  C62 may not include all 
 expected.
 - Imaging Profile
         * Include Nuclear Medicine (Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), 
 etc.) to Radiology.
         * Adjust business rule to share up to twenty-four (24) months in 
 C32. Currently VA provides twelve (12) months or twenty-five (25) 
 reports.
         * The implementation of this requirement is Cytology.
  - Electron Microscopy
         * Supply EM including: collection date and time, specimen, gross 
 description, microscopic exam, brief clinical history, supplemental 
 report, and EM diagnosis.
         * Business rules call for twenty-four (24) months or ten (10) 
 occurrences, whichever  comes first.

 business rule was actually for 150 records over 36 months, and the 
 fix was deployed and retested in Increment 8.
  
 Test sites: N/A

 of the SSA to receive clinical document (CCDA and C62) type documents 
 with several additional data elements. 
  
 External Test Partners: HealtheConnections, MedVA, Kaiser Permanente, and 
 Hawaii Pacific Health.  Testing was conducted successfully with all 
 partners.
  
 Downstream Dependent System Tests: Direct Secure Messaging, 
 MyHealtheVet, Electronic Health Management Platform (eHMP), VistaWeb, and
