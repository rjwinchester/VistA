Subject: VLER eHX Increment 9 (v6.8.0.3) Informational Patch

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Note: Technical support staff at Austin Information Technology Center 
 (AITC) will install this enhancement release on the eHealth Exchange 
 (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) servers located there using a 
 pre-approved Request for Change Order and Implementation Plan.  This 
 deployment is scheduled to take place on June 23, 2016 from 8:00 PM EST - 
 11:00 PM EST.
  
 No effort is required by local sites.  User Acceptance Test is by the 
 direction of the eHealth Exchange Business Owner and no MOUs are required.
 **********************************************************************
   
 eHealth Exchange (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) Adapter Release 
 6.8.0.3 contains code changes (enhancements) to the eHealth Exchange 
 Adapter module.  These changes are Work Items that were recorded and 
 tracked in the eHealth Exchange area of Rational Team Concert, the 
 VA-prescribed tool used for tracking requirements and associated test 
 plans.  This release contains the Work Items completed during production 
 deployment.
  
 This enhancement release consists of the following enhancements to the 
 eHealth Exchange system:
 - Finer grained scalability (separation of components into separate 
 deployments): Provide the ability to scale the system by functional area 
 to allow for deployment of hardware resources based on utilization of 
 specific process modules.  **NOTE: This requirement will not be delivered 
 as part of Increment 9 due to necessary additional hardware and 
 configurations at AITC to make it useful.  The code will be checked in to 
 RTC and documentation supplied to outline how to implement it and in what 
 cases VA would want to do that.
 - Enhanced supportability and maintainability: As a legacy system eHX has 
 been modified by multiple contractors with limited comments and 
 organization.  Updating the functions to include good comments and code 
 structure will help future modifications be done in a timely and 
 effective manner.
 - Analyze and refactor eHX Adapter code to provide more throughput: 
 Performance monitoring and analysis will allow the system to be 
 refactored to make the functions more efficient providing greater 
 throughput for the system.
 - Modularize and segregate larger functional components: Modularizing the 
 system will allow each piece to be modified individually and will reduce 
 the reliance of the system as a whole on individual functions.  This will 
 also allow in the future changes to certain functions to ensure they will 
 not adversely affect other parts of the system.  *NOTE: This requirement 
 will not be delivered as part of Increment 9 due to necessary additional 
 hardware and configurations at AITC to make it useful.  The code will be 
 checked in to RTC and documentation supplied to outline how to implement 
 it and in what cases VA would want to do that.
 - Independent SOA services for external systems: Utilizing VA SOA 
 standards to support Exchange and its interfaces with multiple VA systems 
 across the Enterprise will increase the effectiveness of the VA as a 
 whole for health information exchange.  *NOTE: This is a Non-Functional 
 requirement and Exchange is designed to utilize independent SOA services 
 with our external systems.  This is part of the existing SOAP web 
 services infrastructure.
  
 Test sites - N/A
 The upgraded software will be deployed to a centralized system at AITC.
  
 Increment 9 (6.8.0.3) testing was focused on eHealth Exchange 
 enhancements.  The SQA team reached out to multiple External Partners 
 that were configured within the SQA2 test environment where version 
 6.8.0.3 of the Exchange Adapter was deployed.  The Partners that were 
 contacted were KP, HealtheConnections, MetroHealth, MedVirginia, OCHIN, 
 Hawaii, Sentara and Indiana.
  
 Dependent and other system outreach included: SSA, MHV, JLV, eHMP,
 eBenefits, VistaWeb, VAP and Direct.
  
 In terms of VA outbound queries, KP, MedVa, Sentara, Epic, UC Davis, and 
 Regenstrief/Indiana returned documents (C-32 and/or C-CDA). VA Inbound 
 from partner queries were completed with KP, HealtheConnections, OCHIN 
 and Hawaii (2010 spec).
  
 Out of the other systems contacted MHV, JLV, Direct and eBenefits were 
 able to validate success. SSA is not able to validate from an end to end 
 perspective, however, SSA was validated using the SQA teams soap scripts 
 with success.
  
 The following defects were identified during testing; some remain open, 
 with explanations included:
 Defect ID 310671 - Policy check error while performing a DQ for opted-in 
 patients as a partner.
 Status - Closed.  Note: Development team implemented a mock service to 
 mitigate an unresolved environment configuration issue that allowed 
 permit always.
 Defect ID 312793 - CCDA and C32 are not displaying the data in the sorted 
 order for the allergies, Problems, Medications, and Vital Signs section 
 with date.
 Status - Open.  Note: This defect is still open and will be addressed in 
 a post-Increment 9 patch release upon the business team further 
 elaborating the requirement.
 Defect ID 317749 - MedVA received "Internal Registry/Repository error." 
 when a transaction was sent for CHDRONE test patient.
 Status - Open.  Note: MedVA returned an error that is being investigated 
 by the Sustainment Team; however, considering other partners have been 
 able to test with similar spec levels and document types, this defect is 
 being categorized as low severity.
 Defect ID 317774 - DQ was unsuccessful when Gundersen sent a transaction 
 for NWHINFIVE patient.
 Status - Open.  Note: Gundersen returned an error that is being 
 investigated by the Sustainment Team; however, considering other partners 
 have been able to test with similar spec levels and document types, this 
 defect is being categorized as low severity.
 Defect ID 317788 - Indiana received Patient Not Found message when a DQ 
 was sent to VA for NWHINFIVE patient.
 Status - Open.  Note: Indiana has been contacted several times in the 
 past for testing but has not been able to complete testing with the team 
 due to resource constraints and other issues, as well as experiencing 
 similar issues in Production.
 Defect ID 31993 - OCHIN received Patient Not Found message when a PD was 
 sent to VA.
 Status - Open.  Note: OCHIN returned an error that is being investigated 
 by the Sustainment Team; however, considering other partners have been 
 able to test with similar spec levels and document types, this defect is 
 being categorized as low severity.
