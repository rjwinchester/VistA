Subject: VLER eHX Increment 5 (v6.4.0) Informational Patch

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Note: Technical support staff at Austin Information Technology Center 
 (AITC) will install this enhancement release on the eHealth Exchange 
 (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) servers located there using a 
 pre-approved Request for 
 Change Order and Implementation Plan.  This deployment is scheduled to 
 take place on October 15, 2015 from 8:00 PM EST - 11:00 PM EST.
  
 No effort is required by local sites.  User Acceptance Test is by the 
 direction of the eHealth Exchange Business Owner and no MOUs are required.
 **************************************************************************
 eHealth Exchange (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) Adapter Release 
 6.4.0.17 contains code changes (enhancements) to the eHealth Exchange 
 Adapter module.  These changes are Work Items that were recorded and 
 tracked in the eHealth Exchange area of Rational Team Concert, the 
 VA-prescribed tool used for tracking requirements and associated test 
 plans.  This release contains the Work Items completed during production 
 deployment.
  
 This enhancement release consists of the following enhancements to the 
 eHealth Exchange system:
 - Denial of Service: Provide a mechanism to prevent Exchange Partners 
 from overloading the VA eHealth Exchange system with Patient Discovery 
 (PD) requests. The system will prevent the receipt of additional PD 
 requests received from a partner once the partner has exceeded system 
 thresholds.  The  system will continue to allow Query for Documents (QD) 
 and Retrieval of Documents (RD) requests and PDs from other partners. 
 Information provided indicates that the current system allows for up to 
 500 simultaneous transactions (system threshold).
 - Exchange Service Interface Enhancements:  Updates will be made to the 
 Adapter software to allow an application consuming the Exchange Service 
 to specify the document format [C32, C62 or various Consolidated Clinical 
 Document Architecture (C-CDA) types], document sections, and business 
 rules for data returned.  Future increments will filter or mask data for 
 security purposes.  
 - Support for Filtering Test Patients: Identify and make any changes 
 needed to the audit transactions to support the Veterans Authorization & 
 Preferences (VAP) application in filtering out test patients from 
 reports. 
 - Standards & Terminology Services (STS) Translations:  The Adapter will 
 provide functionality to translate data provided to the Adapter from the 
 following sources:
         * Translate pre-defined elements using translations that are 
 currently available through     the VA Enterprise Terminology Services 
 (VETS) translation service
         * Translate values that are not currently available for 
 translation through the VETS    translation service using a local data 
 source
         * Translate values that are not currently available for 
 translation through the VETS    translation service or a local data 
 source by the adapter providing a static translation or by      
 populating a default value
         *Ensure that deprecated/outdated Logical Observation Identifiers 
 Names and Codes         (LOINC) codes from an older specification are not 
 sent out in the VA Clinical Care        Document (CCD).  Replace outdated 
 codes with null flavor or unknown.   Use        spreadsheet provided to 
 determine if LOINC codes are outdated. 
  
 Test sites: N/A
 The upgraded software will be deployed to a centralized system at AITC.
  
 Testing Process: Release 6.4 testing was focused on the CCDA readability 
 enhancements and the retrieval of specific records and notes within a 
 specific date range for the Encounters, Surgical Procedures, Discharge 
 Summaries, History and Physicals, Pathology and Consults sections of the 
 CCDA. There was also a large change in regards to International 
 Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 Codes being converted correctly into 
 the new Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) 
 codes.
  Increment 5 testing also includes the enhancements
 of error messages for outbound query of documents.
