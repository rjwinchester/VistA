 eHealth Exchange Adapter and Architecture Enhancements
  
 Description: This build will deliver customer facing enhancements to the 
 eHealth Exchange Adapter and eHealth Exchange system Architecture.  The 
 build will include new and updated enhancements to the way consolidated 
 clinical documents are displayed to the user and system architecture 
 optimizations.
  
 eHealth Exchange Adapter and Architecture Enhancements Build 5 has the 
 following features: 
 1. Implemented C-CDA CCD R2.1 as a new VA-supported document type.
 2. Enhanced C-CDA stylesheet to support the display of the C-CDA CCD R2.1.
 3. Resolved MHV C-CDA requests to include Electronically Filed Radiology 
    Reports, remove list limit on associated encounter notes, and partially
    revert note de-duplication business rules.
  
 Supported several STS/VETS related changes, including:
 1. The ability to perform look-ups/translations using the most current 
    code-set available for the target terminology.
 2. Removed the internal deprecated LOINC look-up.
 3. Added error handling to allow Adapter to continue the document 
    generation process when errors are encountered during VETS 
    look-ups/translations.
 4. Secured the eHX Subscription Service and performed integration testing 
    with DAS.
 5. Separated the Data Quality zip file process from the push to Diameter 
    Health, so that each process can be configured to be turned "on" or
    "off" independently.
