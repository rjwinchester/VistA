Subject: VLER eHEALTH EXCHANGE 6.0.1.3 INFORMATION PATCH

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Note: Technical support staff at Austin Information Technology Center
 (AITC) will install this patch on December 7, 2014, between 12:00 AM - 
 3:00 AM EST
 on the eHealth Exchange (formerly VLER and
 formerly NHIN) servers located there using a pre-approved Request for 
 Change Order and Implementation Plan.
  
 No effort is required by local sites.  User Acceptance Test is by the 
 direction of the eHealth Exchange Business Owner and no MOU are required.
 **********************************************************************
   
 eHealth Exchange (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) Adapter Patch 6.0.1.3 
 contains code changes (defect fixes and enhancements) to the eHealth 
 Exchange Adapter module.  These changes are Work Items that were recorded 
 and tracked in the eHealth Exchange area of RTC.  This patch contains the 
 Work Items completed during production deployment. 
  
 The scope of this patch release includes the AAOID and Display Name 
 patches for Increment 1, Release 1.  These patches address the following:
  
 Issue 1: Assigning Authority Organization Identifier (AAOID): 
 When initiating a patient discovery the system was returning the 
 incorrect assigning authority ID due to the fact that some partners have 
 multiple assigning authority IDs and the system had trouble deciphering. 
  
 The patch ensures that the correct assigning authority is used when 
 patient discoveries are executed.
  
 Impacts to Healthcare: As a result of this issue, partners with a 
 different HC vs AA OID have bad correlations for any correlations created 
 after Adapter 6.0 was deployed.  These incorrect correlations may cause 
 VA initiated Document Queries to fail because the VA outbound query would 
 include their AA OID (which is wrong) and patient ID in the request for 
 documents.
  
 Solution: Updated MVI1301DataAdapter Class to use the AAOID instead of 
 the HCID for setting the correlated ID in the 1301 request sent to MVI.
  
  
 Issue 2: When inbound/outbound document queries are initiated, the proper 
 display name is not populated.  The patch includes the ability for all 
 inbound/outbound queries to populate the proper display name when 
 executing document queries.
  
 Impacts to Healthcare: HealtheCONNECTIONS reports that VA is not 
 populating the displayName attribute for the Document Query in Adapter 
 6.0.
  
 Solution: Reimplemented STS lookup for display name.
  
  
 Testing Process: The testing process included drafting test cases focused 
 on executing patient discovery queries and ensuring that the proper AAOID 
 is identified. In addition to AAOID testing, test cases were drafted to 
 ensure that the proper display name is populated when initiating document 
 queries. Testing for the AAOID functionality included 4 partners while 
 display name testing included 5 partners. Test results were documented in 
 a Test Evaluation Report and signed off by the business. 
  
 Test sites: N/A; VA eHealth Exchange is a middleware application. 
 Testing was conducted at AITC.
  
 Remedy tickets: None
