Subject: VLER eHealX V6.1.0.14 INFORMATIONAL PATCH

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Note: Technical support staff at Austin Information Technology Center
 (AITC) will install this enhancement release
 on the eHealth Exchange (formerly VLER and
 formerly NHIN) servers located there using a pre-approved Request for 
 Change Order and Implementation Plan.  This deployment is scheduled to 
 take place on April 23, 2015 from 8:00 PM EST - 11:00 PM EST.
  
 No effort is required by local sites.  User Acceptance Test is by the 
 direction of the eHealth Exchange Business Owner and no MOUs are required.
 **********************************************************************
   
 eHealth Exchange (formerly VLER and formerly NHIN) Adapter Release 
 6.1.0.14
 contains code changes (enhancements) to the eHealth Exchange Adapter 
 module.  These changes are Work Items that were recorded and tracked in 
 the eHealth Exchange area of RTC.  This release contains the Work Items 
 completed during production deployment. 
  
 This eHealth Exchange enhancement release will enable the creation of the 
 VA-generated Consolidated-Clinical Data Architecture (C-CDA) .  The 
 creation of the C-CDA will allow the exchange of patient-care information 
 using new specifications, a change which will enhance the clinical care 
 of Veteran patients by providing more data than is currently available in 
 a C32-formatted record.  This capability is also needed in order to meet 
 Meaningful Use Stage 2 requirements.  This release will upgrade the 
 system to support the send, receive, and display of the 
 Consolidated-Clinical Data Architecture (C-CDA) format of healthcare 
 data.  This format is being used by more and more eHealth Exchange 
 partners because it is more precisely defined than the older C32 format 
 is.
  
 Test sites - N/A
 The upgraded software will be deployed to a centralized system at AITC.
  
 Testing Process: Increment 2 testing was successfully conducted with 
 Kaiser Permanente, Med Virginia, Indiana HIE, Wright State and 
 HealtheLink, while Document Push testing was conducted with Walgreens. 
 Testing occurred between 12/19/2014 and 3/17/2015. There were a total of 
 sixty eight defects identified during testing eHealth Exchange. Of the 68 
 total defects 64 have been retested and passed while 4 have been deferred 
 to Increment 4 at the request of the business.  Additional details on the 
 testing process and results, including the Test Execution Log and Test 
 Defect Log, are contained within the Increment 2 Test Evaluation Report.
  
 The new modules that are now supported in the C-CDA are:
 Plan of Care
 Insurance Provider
 Health Care Providers
 Advanced Directive
 Social History
  
 The C-CDA format will be used by external partners only.
  
 Remedy tickets: None.
