 1. Incident INC0157491 - Referred to Tier 3. National ticket #INC0228910.
    Incident INC0228910 - POSTMASTER REMOVES PHONE NUMBER FROM PATIENT
    FILE VIA HL TASK RESTART/EAS ESR 595 ORU-Z05 CLIENT JOB - USER DOES NOT
    WANT THIS.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The routine for uploading the home phone number directly to the PATIENT
 file (#2) was changed to follow the way the other communications data were
 handled (cell phone number, email address and pager number). The logic
 would delete the data in any of these fields in the PATIENT file (#2)
 if an incoming HL7 Z05 message did not contain these fields specifically.
 By including the home phone number in this logic, if a Z05 did not contain
 a home phone number, the data in that field would be deleted in the
 PATIENT file (#2). Then an outgoing Z07 message would be created without a
 home phone number and sent to ES. ES would in turn send Z05 messages to
 sites of record and these sites would also have the home phone number
 deleted. This issue only affects the data of patients that are in more
 than one hospital database.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The logic was changed to no longer include the home phone number fields
 where the communications fields were being deleted if the PID segment did 
 not have these fields in it. If the home phone number sequence in the PID 
 segment has a null for the home phone number and the home phone number 
 change date/time stamp is more recent than what is in the PATIENT file 
 (#2), the home phone number will be deleted. Additionally, if there is no
 RF1 segment of "PHH" type, the home phone number will not be deleted.

 Back-Out Plan
 -------------
 In the event a site determines that this patch should be backed out, the 
 site should submit a Your IT Services ticket with the Enterprise Service
 Desk (ESD) for assistance with the procedure.
  
 1. Back-out Procedure:
  
 Prior to installing this patch (IVM*2.0*171), the installer should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 2. Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
  
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the IVM* routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the 
 IVM*2.0*171 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the
 routines will no longer contain the designation of patch IVM*2.0*171 in
 the patch list section on line 2.
