Description:
============

 Patch IVM*2.0*177 is being released to support the enhancements for the
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 project.
  
 As part of the HL7 messaging from the Enrollment System (ES) to
 Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 Registration, Eligibility & Enrollment (REE), patient demographic
 information is sent to VistA sites where the patient is known.
  
 Since October 2018, over fifty-one thousand (51,000) Veterans had their 
 addresses updated in ES more than four times. Based on spot checks, most 
 of those updates were due to VistA rejecting the most recent address
 updates and sending the old address back to ES as a new address update.
  
 Background Information:
 -----------------------
 When the Enrollment System (ES) receives a demographic update for a 
 patient, an ORU-Z05, Demographic Data Transmission, is sent to all 
 treating facilities where the patient is known.
  
 Currently, for patients with an active prescription, the Permanent Mailing
 Address is uploaded to a temporary location for display and manual
 verification in the DEMOGRAPHICS UPLOAD [IVM UPLOAD DEM] option. The
 demographic data is retained for 14 days. If not reviewed and accepted by
 a user within that timeframe, the address update is rejected, if the
 patient still has an active prescription on file at the VistA site. The
 IVM BACKGROUND JOB [IVM BACKGROUND JOB] handles the review process.
 If the address is rejected by a user or if it is not reviewed within 14
 days and the patient still has an active prescription, the Permanent
 Mailing Address on file at the VistA site is sent back to ES with a
 date/time stamp of the current day. ES processes the Z07 message as a new
 address update for the patient. As a result, old address updates (instead
 of the most current addresses) are propagated across the VA enterprise.
  
 New Functionality:
 ------------------
 With installation of patch IVM*2.0*177, the processing of the HL7 ORU-Z05 
 message from ES is modified to eliminate the check for an active 
 prescription. If an incoming Permanent Mailing Address change is 
 determined to be the most current, the update(s) will be directly 
 uploaded to the PATIENT file (#2). The BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR (#.121) field
 is no longer considered in determining whether to upload the address.
  
 The DEMOGRAPHICS UPLOAD [IVM UPLOAD DEM] option should not be used to
 accept or reject Permanent Mailing Address Updates.
  
 For those records still pending in the IVM UPLOAD DEMOGRAPHIC TOOL at the 
 time the patch is installed, if an address change is rejected via the 
 IVM BACKGROUND JOB, no HL7 message acknowledgement or HL7 ORU-Z07 address
 update is sent to ES. The existing functionality is retained which removes
 the pending address update record from the IVM PATIENT file (#301.5) 14
 days after the update was received. Therefore, 14 days after patch
 IVM*2.0*177 is installed, the IVM UPLOAD DEMOGRAPHIC TOOL will no longer
 display any Permanent Mailing Addresses.
  
 Listing of Updates:
 ===================
 Patch IVM*2.0*177 makes the following changes to VistA REE:
  
 1. The processing of the HL7 ORU-Z05 message from ES is modified to
    eliminate the check for an active prescription and BAD ADDRESS 
    INDICATOR (#.121) so that Permanent Mailing Address fields are 
    automatically uploaded to the PATIENT file (#2) if the change date/time
    is more recent than what is in the PATIENT file (#2). The Permanent
    Mailing Address fields that are loaded are as follows:
    a. ADDRESS CHANGE DT/TM (#.118) 
    b. ADDRESS CHANGE SITE (#.12)
    c. ADDRESS CHANGE SOURCE (#.119) 
    d. CITY (#.114) 
    e. COUNTY (#.117) 
    f. COUNTRY (#.1173) 
    g. POSTAL CODE (#.1172) (zip code)
    h. PROVINCE (#.1171) 
    i. STATE (#.115) 
    j. STREET ADDRESS [LINE 1] (#.111) 
    k. STREET ADDRESS [LINE 2] (#.112)
    l. STREET ADDRESS [LINE 3] (#.113) 
    m. STREET ADDRESS CASS INDICATOR (#.1118)
    n. BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR (#.121) 
  
 2. The IVM Background Job [IVM BACKGROUND JOB] is modified to no longer
    trigger an ORU-Z07 message to ES after a pending address update is 
    rejected due to the 14-day expiration. Per existing functionality, the 
    pending address update is removed from the IVM PATIENT file (#301.5) 
    after the 14-day expiration. Therefore, 14 days after patch IVM*2.0*177
    is installed, the IVM UPLOAD DEMOGRAPHIC TOOL will no longer display
    any Permanent Mailing Addresses.
