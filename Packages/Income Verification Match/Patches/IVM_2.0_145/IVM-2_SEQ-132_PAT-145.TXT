 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 ======================
  
 1)  INC0000000302145 - Date of Death Entry
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When an ORU-Z05 (Demographic Data) HL7 transmission message is uploaded 
 from Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) to VistA, is not processed in the 
 Income Verification Match (IVM) Demographic Upload screen because an 
 'Invalid Date of Death' error is generated.
 This problem occurs when a Date of Death message containing a time value 
 is sent in the ORU-Z05 and is uploaded on the SAME DAY that the
 death occurred.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine, IVMPRECA, checks the transmitted Date of Death field
 against the current system date/time to ensure the Date of Death is
 less than the current system date/time.
  
  
 2)  INC0000000311832 - Enrollment Code making calls to obsolete PFSS calls
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A Patient Financial Service System (PFSS) Program interface (API) call 
 was left in routine IVMPREC2 and since the PFSS Project was cancelled,
 the called routine no longer exist. While the call causes no problems 
 due to a check to see if the routine exist before the routine is 
 executed, it does causes Syntax errors in XINDEX. The call will need 
 to be removed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The API call will be removed from routine IVMPREC2.
