Subject: HOME PHONE AND FUTURE DISCHARGE DATE UPDATES 

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Patch IVM*2.0*167 is being released to support the enhancements for the
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on 
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) project, which 
 supports Enrollment System Community Care (ESCC).
  
 Patch IVM*2.0*167 is being released as a supporting patch for Registration 
 Patch DG*5.3*935. IVM*2.0*167 contains routine changes to check if a Future 
 Discharge Date (FDD) record exists. An FDD record consists of a Service 
 Branch, Entry Date and Future Discharge Date. If an FDD record exists, it 
 will not be included in the ZMH segment of the ORU-Z07 and ORF-Z07 messages 
 sent from Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) to Enrollment System (ES).
  
 The Military Service Future Discharge Date (FDD) build components include
 changes to manage, process and display an FDD record. The record can be
 manually updated in the ES and is read-only in VistA Registration. An FDD 
 record can be received from the military service broker or via an on-line 
 Healthcare Application. A Veteran can apply for Department of Veterans 
 Affairs (VA) health benefits enrollment before being discharged from the 
 military. The ES is the VA authoritative system for this information. VistA 
 will update the military service episode (MSE) list and FDD record to match 
 what is provided by ES. The FDD record will not be transmitted from VistA to 
 the ES.
  
 Home Phone Number updates include disabling Home Phone data elements in
 Income Verification Match (IVM) Demographics Upload Tool and directly
 uploading PHONE NUMBER[RESIDENCE] field (#.131), RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE 
 DT/TM field (#.1321),and RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE SITE field (#.1323), 
 RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE SOURCE field (#.1322) to the PATIENT file (#2).
  
 Listing of Updates
 ================== 
  
 1. Disable Home Phone data elements in the IVM Demographics Upload tool 
 as the application will not allow VistA to automatically file PHONE NUMBER
 [RESIDENCE] field (#.131), RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE DT/TM field (#.1321),
 RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE SITE field (#.1323) or RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE 
 SOURCE field (#.1322) to the PATIENT file (#2) when processing Health Level 
 7 (HL7) messages from ES.
  
 2. Directly upload the Home Phone data elements PHONE NUMBER [RESIDENCE] 
 field (#.131), RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE DT/TM field (#.1321), RESIDENCE
 NUMBER CHANGE SITE field (#.1323), RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE SOURCE field 
 (#.1322) into PATIENT file (#2) when received from ES if the conditions
 listed below are met:
  
  a. The Change Date/Time of the incoming Home Phone Number is not null.
  
  b. The Change Date/Time of the incoming Home Phone Number from ES is more
     recent than the VistA Change Date/Time of Home Phone Number.
  
 3. Update VistA to exclude the FDD record in the ZMH segment of the 
    ORU/ORF-Z07.
