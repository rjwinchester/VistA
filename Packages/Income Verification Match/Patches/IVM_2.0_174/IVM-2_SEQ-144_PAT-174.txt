Subject: CLEANUP OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS IN INCOME PERSON (#408.13) FILE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses Your IT Services incident INC1928289 to fix a 
 critical defect introduced by Enrollment System (ES) 5.3 and corrected
 by 5.3.0.070001, where the dependent Social Security Number (SSN) data at
 the Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) facilities was corrupted and requires a VistA patch to clean up
 the database corruption.
  
 Please refer to the 'Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview' 
 section of this patch for a description of the problem and its resolution.
  
 This patch is a follow-up patch to DG*5.3*970 and it is required to
 install this patch. Patch DG*5.3*970 created global ^XTMP("DG53970P")
 which lists the dependent records' Internal Entry Numbers (IENs) in the
 INCOME PERSON file (#408.13) that need to have the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER
 (#.09) field updated. It also lists the record number (DFN) in PATIENT
 (#2) file for the patient associated with the dependent record.
  
 Patch IVM*2.0*174 uses this global when processing the Health Level 7
 (HL7) ORU-Z10 message from ES to update the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (#.09)
 field of dependent records in the INCOME PERSON file (#408.13) and to
 clean them out of the ^XTMP("DG53970P") global. Additionally, a
 post-install routine extends the expiration date of the 
 ^XTMP("DG53970P") global by an additional 120 days from the patch 
 install date and submits a background job to send a MailMan message
 every 2 days to report the status of IENs and DFNs remaining in the ^XTMP
 global. The message is sent to FORUM MailMan group
 G.IVM20174MONITOR@FORUM.DOMAIN.EXT. The members of the mail group consist of
 developers, Software Quality Assurance (SQA), and Health Product
 Support.  A copy of the mail message will be sent to the installer of
 patch IVM*2.0*174.
  
 Once all dependent records identified in the ^XTMP("DG53970P") global
 have had the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (#.09) field of the INCOME PERSON file
 (#408.13) successfully updated, the background job will no longer be 
 automatically queued to check the global and send a status message.
  
 Listing of Updates:
 ===================
 Patch IVM*2.0*174 modifies the processing of the HL7 ORU-Z10 message from 
 ES as follows:
  
 1. If the Patient record from the ORU-Z10 PID segment is found in the 
    ^XTMP("DG53970P") global, only the ZDP segments in the message are 
    processed as follows:
    a. The dependent record (Internal Entry Number) from the INCOME PERSON
       file (#408.13) is derived from the ZDP segment. If that record is
       found in the ^XTMP("DG53970P") global, the SSN from the ZDP segment
       is filed into the INCOME PERSON file (#408.13) for that dependent.
    b. The SSN will be validated prior to filing and will not be filed if 
       it is invalid. The SSN must be 9 numbers.
    c. If the ZDP segment includes a PSEUDO SSN REASON and it is a valid 
       value of "S", "N", or "R", it is stored in the INCOME PERSON file 
       (#408.13) in the PSEUDO SSN REASON field (#.1) and a "P" is appended
       to the SSN prior to being filed.
    d. Prior to the SSN being updated, the SSN field in the INCOME PERSON
       file (#408.13) is checked and will be corrected if the field is 
       corrupted.
    e. If the filing of the SSN fails, the error message is placed in the 
       ^XTMP("DG53970P") global.
    f. If the filing of the SSN is successful, the associated 
       ^XTMP("DG53970P") entry is removed.
  
 2. If the DFN in the PID segment is not found in ^XTMP("DG53970P") 
    global, the ORU-Z10 message is processed normally.
  
 3. A post-install routine is run that submits the background task 
    IVM*2.0*174 STATUS UPDATE JOB that produces a MailMan message that
    lists the patient records and associated dependent records from the
    ^XTMP("DG53970P") global. If there are entries in the ^XTMP("DG53970P")
    global, this job is submitted to run again in 2 days. The MailMan
    message lists the following information:
    a. The total number of patient records and associated dependent 
       records that need to have the SSN field updated.
    b. Each DFN and the associated dependent IENs in the ^XTMP("DG53970P") 
       that need to have the SSN updated. If an ORU-Z10 message failed
       to update an SSN for a dependent record, the error is shown with the
       record.
  
 An example of the MailMan message is shown below.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. Incident: INC1928289 
    Short Description: <SUBSCRIPT>IX+1^DIE1 ^DGPR(408.13 - Error Seen At 
    Multiple Sites
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Critical defect #810016 was logged against Enrollment System (ES) 5.3 
 build. A new build was created to address the defect.  Emergency 
 Release ES 5.3.0.07001 implemented code changes to remove a method and 
 method calls that were removing the SSN from the ZDP segment and setting 
 it to a single "space" character. Dependent Social Security Number (SSN)
 data at the VistA facilities was corrupted and requires a VistA patch to
 clean up the database corruption.  Upon follow-up with the facilities who
 reported the original error, additional instances of a slightly different
 error were being seen after the deployment of the code fix.  The expected
 outcome is that no errors would be seen after the deployment of ES
 5.3.0.07001.  The error logged in the VistA instances is as follows:
  
   $ZE= <SUBSCRIPT>IX^DIE1 ^DGPR(408.13,"BS","")
  
   K ^DGPR(408.13,"BS",$E(X,6,9),DA)
  
 The error is occurring on the second instance of an inbound financial HL7 
 transmission (ORU-Z10) for a patient.  The root cause was determined to 
 be the data (in this case an empty space) which was filed into the SOCIAL 
 SECURITY NUMBER field (#.09) of the INCOME PERSON file (#408.13). The SSN 
 data in that file was potentially degraded by the initial issue. ES was 
 remediated, the second transmission files the correct data; however, 
 still errors due to the previous value.  A third or higher transmission 
 should file without error.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The processing of the ORU-Z10 message is modified:
  
 1. If the DFN is found in the global ^XTMP("DG53970P"), which was created 
    by patch DG*5.3*970 to capture the records that need to be corrected,  
    then process only the ZDP segments to retrieve and store the dependent 
    SSNs. No other segments or data are processed.
 2. If the SSN update was successful, remove the associated entries from 
    the ^XTMP("DG53970P") global.
 3. If the SSN update was not successful, store the error in the 
    ^XTMP("DG53970P") global.
  
 Once all facilities have installed this emergency patch IVM*2.0*174 by 
 the Compliance date, ES will be sending ORU-Z10 HL7 messages for all
 veterans that have dependents that needed the SSN updated during non-
 peak hours.
  
 The post-install routine EP^IVM2174P queues the background task
 IVM*2.0*174 STATUS UPDATE JOB that gathers the DFNs and IENs that are in
 the ^XTMP("DG53970P") global. These values are listed in an email sent to
 FORUM MailMan group G.IVM20174MONITOR@FORUM.DOMAIN.EXT. Members of this mail
 group will monitor messages received from facilities and coordinate 
 with ES about retransmission of corrected SSN data from ES via an HL7 
 (ORU-Z10) message. The members of the mail group consist of developers,
 Software Quality Assurance (SQA), and Health Product Support.  A copy of
 the mail message will be sent to the installer of patch IVM*2.0*174. If
 there are still entries in the global, this task will automatically be
 resubmitted to run in the background in 2 days.
  
 Once all dependent records identified in the ^XTMP("DG53970P") global
 have had the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (#.09) field of the INCOME PERSON file
 (#408.13) successfully updated, the background job will no longer be 
 automatically queued to check the global and send a status message.

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not delete the post-installation routine IVM2174P
 from your system.
  
  
 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------
 In the event a site determines that this patch should be backed out, the 
 site should submit a YOUR IT Services ticket with the Enterprise Service
 Desk (ESD) for assistance with the procedure.
  
 This patch is part of a dependent/spouse SSN data cleanup effort that was
 initiated with patch DG*5.3*970. Any issues would need to be evaluated
 to determine if: a back-out of the software is appropriate; a new patch
 is needed; or if the data can be manually corrected.    
  
 During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as 
 directed, "Backup a Transport Global", then routines will have the 
 ability to be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was 
 generated. However, the KIDS installation process does not perform a 
 backup of other VistA software components, such as data dictionaries, 
 templates, options, protocols, etcetera.
