Description:
============

 Patch IVM*2.0*164 is being released to support the enhancements for the
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on 
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) project, which 
 supports Enrollment System Community Care (ESCC).
  
 IVM*2.0*164 is being released with DG*5.3*941 and EAS*1.0*151 in
 Host File DG_53_P941.KID.
  
 IVM*2.0*164 is also being released in support of Enrollment System (ES)
 5.2 release. Refer to Informational Patch EAS*1.0*159 (Enrollment
 Application System) for additional details regarding the ES release.
  
 This patch makes the following enhancements to Veterans Health Information
 Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Registration, Eligibility, &
 Enrollment (REE):
  
 This patch will modify VistA Health Level 7 (HL7) messaging.
  
 VistA Registration will send and receive a new address type of 
 Residential Address to and from the Enrollment System. This address 
 is used by Enrollment and Eligibility to retain the geographic residence 
 of an applicant or patient. It supports the ESCC program's need to
 determine geographic distance from a treatment facility.
  
 For each address type, VistA Registration will also send and receive the 
 new "Coding Accuracy Support System (CASS) Certified" data element, which 
 is used to indicate whether or not the format of the address has been 
 verified by third party software.  
  
 The Income Verification Match (IVM) Demographic Upload Utility will 
 include the Permanent Mailing Address CASS Certified field. 
  
 Listing of Updates
 ==================
     
 1. With installation of this patch, VistA receives, stores, and displays  
    Residential Addresses sent by ES.
  
    a. Address changes are received from ES via Z05 HL7 messages which now
       include the Residential Address in the PATIENT IDENTIFICATION (PID)
       segment.
    b. Logic for Confidential Mailing Address now allows VistA to process
       Confidential Mailing Address updates when ES is ready to send
       them. Previously, when a Confidential Mailing Address was updated
       in ES, a Z05 was sent to VistA, but "site number" logic prevented
       the address changes from being processed on VistA. The impact of
       this change will not be apparent until ES begins to send the
       Confidential Mailing Addresses to VistA.
  
 2. When VistA receives a Residential Address type on the Z05 HL7 message
    from ES, VistA checks the Date/Time last updated:
  
    a. If, and only if the incoming address is newer, the address is stored
       on VistA.
    b. If the incoming address on the Z05 is older, it is not stored.
    c. No other validation is applicable to Residential Address types 
       during the Z05 upload.
  
 3. The HL7 message from ES to VistA includes the new CASS Certified
    field for Permanent Mailing, Temporary Mailing, Confidential Mailing,
    and Residential Address types in the new ZAV Segment.
  
    a. The new ZAV, Address Verification, segment will be included for each
       address type included in the Z05 message.
    b. The new ZAV, Address Verification, segment will be included for each
       address type included in the Z07 message.
  
 4. The IVM Demographic Upload Utility is modified to include the 
    Permanent Mailing Address CASS Certified field.
  
    When a Permanent Mailing Address is received from ES on the Z05, the
    associated CASS Certified field will either be uploaded to the IVM
    Demographic Upload Utility or directly to the PATIENT file (#2) based
    on the existing rules for processing a Permanent Mailing Address.
  
 5. The following menu options allow a Registration user to view, add or
    update the Residential Address. If any Residential address field is
    added or updated, VistA will send the change to ES via the Z07 HL7
    message.  The new ZAV, Address Verification, segment will be included
    for each address type included in the Z05 message.
