Subject: FIX Z07 FOR IMPRECISE RETIREMENT DATE / FORMAT PHONE NUMBER FOR Z05

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch, IVM*2*168, will allow for processing of information from the
 PATIENT (#2) file, DATE OF RETIREMENT (#.31116) and SPOUSE'S RETIREMENT
 DATE (#.2516) fields as imprecise dates when they are passed to the 
 Enrollment System (ES) now that the ES system is capable of accepting the
 information in these two fields. It will also stop unconditional 
 stripping of format characters for PHONE NUMBER [CELLULAR] (#.134) and
 PAGER NUMBER (#.135) in the same file when received from ORU-Z05 
 transmissions. Due to a user entry error, the original ticket mentioned
 work phone number, but that is not processed in the same manner as the 
 cell phone and pager numbers.  Only the cell phone and pager numbers are 
 formatted in this manner prior to input.

 Ticket Overview:
 ===============
 1. I9917097FY16 - Veteran's and Spouse's Retirement Date does not accept 
 an imprecise date.
  
  Problem:
  -------
  The Enrollment System Release ESR 3.1 added sharing and filing of the
  veteran's and spouse's retirement date. The Enrollment System (ES)
  rejects the Z07 record when the veteran's or spouse's retirement date is
  imprecise.
  
  Resolution:
  ----------
  Updated routine IVMPTRN8, adding a new parameter value to allow
  imprecise dates to be accepted.
  
  Technical:
  ---------
  Routine BUILD^IVMPTRN8 has been modified to set a "9" parameter value 
  into the call for the ZEM segment build.
  
 S IVMCT=IVMCT+1,^TMP("HLS",$J,IVMCT)=$$EN^VAFHLZEM(DFN,"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9")
 S IVMCT=IVMCT+1,^TMP("HLS",$J,IVMCT)=$$EN^VAFHLZEM(DFN,"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9",
 2,2)
  
  This allows VAFHLZEM to process the retirement date, which was previously
  removed to prevent errors in the ES system.
  
  
 2. I15474705FY17 - Work Phone, Cell Phone, and Pager not filing in 
 correct format when received on ORU-Z05 from ESR.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When filing inbound ORU-Z05 the patient's work phone, cell phone, and 
   pager do not format correctly. Format should be (###)###-####. 
   Currently the numbers are filing as ##########.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Updated routine CONVPH^IVMPREC8 so that it pattern-matches the passed
   in number currently for cell phone and pager only to see if it is in the
   correct format. If it matches, it quits. If it doesn't, it strips using
   the old logic and then rechecks to see if the number is a 10 digit
   numeric and reformats it properly. Otherwise, it stores the numbers
   according to the pre-existing logic.
  
   Technical:
   ---------
   For current processing of cell phone and pager numbers only.
   
   Previous logic just quit and returned a stripped string with:
   Q $TR(PH," )(/#\-","")
  
   New logic will check and quit if ok:
   Q:PH?1"(".3N.1")".3N.1"-".4N PH
  
   Then strip if not:
   S PH=$TR(PH," )(/#\-","")
  
   If stripping results in anything other than 10 digit numeric it quits 
   and returns stripped string as done previously:
   Q:PH'?10N PH
  
   If the string is a 10 digit numeric then we know what we have and can 
   format according to requirement and return formatted string:
   Q "("_$E(PH,1,3)_")"_$E(PH,4,6)_"-"_$E(PH,7,10)
