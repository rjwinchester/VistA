Subject: OTHER HEALTH INSURANCE (OHI) TO VISTA

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Patch IVM*2.0*172 is being released to support the enhancements for the
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 project.
  
 IVM*2.0*172 is also being released in support of the Enrollment System 
 (ES) 5.4 release. Refer to Informational Patch EAS*1*169 (Enrollment 
 Application System) for additional details regarding the ES release.
  
 This Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture 
 (VistA) Registration, Eligibility & Enrollment (REE) patch enhances the 
 ability of VA's Office of Care Coordination (OCC) to receive Other Health 
 Insurance (OHI) information from Community Care Network (CCN) contractors.
  
 OCC Revenue staff need the source of OHI information to be reflected in 
 the Insurance Buffer, to be routed through the correct workflow process, 
 and to be available for analytics. To accomplish these goals, the ES will 
 send a new Source of Information Code 14 "Purchased Care CHOICE" or 
 Source of Information Code 3 "IVM", and the Insured's Date of Birth (DOB) 
 to VistA. 
  
 When ES receives OHI information from a Community Care Network (CCN) 
 contractor, ES sends VistA a Health Level 7 (HL7) message assigning the 
 Source of Information Code 14 "Purchased Care CHOICE". The source of 
 information will reflect in the Insurance Buffer as "Purchased 
 Care CHOICE" instead of defaulting as "IVM".
  
 If OHI is entered in ES via the Health Eligibility Center (HEC), then ES 
 will assign the Source of Information Code 3 "IVM" to the HL7 message 
 that will be sent to VistA. VistA will receive the Source of Information 
 Code 3 "IVM" and this data will be passed through the existing workflow 
 to the Insurance Buffer.
  
 ES will send the Insured's DOB when it sends insurance information to 
 VistA. Staff will be able to view in VistA the Insured's DOB value on the 
 record in the Insurance Buffer as an element for validating insurance.
  
 Listing of Updates
 ==================
 This patch makes the following enhancements to VistA REE:
  
 1. The HL7 interface with ES is modified to include two additional data
    elements that will be available for analytics: 
    a. SOURCE OF INFORMATION. The ORUZ04 message contains a new
       sequence #13 in the ZIV segment.
    b. INSURED'S DATE OF BIRTH. The ORUZ04 message populates
       sequence #18 in the IN1 segment.
  
 2. When VistA receives an HL7 ORUZ04 message, the two fields are 
    stored in the following locations:
    a. SOURCE OF INFORMATION is stored in the SOURCE OF INFORMATION 
       field (#.03) within the INSURANCE VERIFICATION PROCESSOR file
       (#355.33).
    b. INSURED'S DATE OF BIRTH is stored in the INSURED'S DOB
       field (#60.08) within the INSURANCE VERIFICATION PROCESSOR file
       (#355.33).
  
 3. The processing of these 2 fields above are as follows:
    a. SOURCE OF INFORMATION - only 2 values are accepted from the ORU-Z04:
       3 - IVM and 14 - Purchased Care CHOICE.
    b. INSURED'S DATE OF BIRTH - The date will be transformed into FileMan 
       format before storing.
  
 4. Data for SOURCE OF INFORMATION and INSURED'S DATE OF BIRTH can be 
    viewed within the INSURANCE VERIFICATION PROCESSOR file (#355.33). 
    The data will be viewable within the Process Insurance Buffer menu
    option.

 Back-Out Plan
 -------------
 In the event a site determines that this patch should be backed out, the 
 site should submit a YOUR IT Services ticket with the Enterprise Service 
 Desk (ESD) for assistance with the procedure.
  
 Any issues would need to be evaluated to determine if: a back-out of the 
 software is appropriate; a new patch is needed; or if data requires 
 correction or restoration.
   
 During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as 
 directed, "Backup a Transport Global", then routines will have the 
 ability to be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was 
 generated. However, the KIDS installation process does not perform a 
 backup of other VistA software components, such as data dictionaries, 
 templates, options, protocols, etcetera.
