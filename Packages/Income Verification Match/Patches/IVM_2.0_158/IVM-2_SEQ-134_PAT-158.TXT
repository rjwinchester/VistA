          IVM*2*158 (Income Verification Match) is being released along

 **************************************************************************
  
 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is amending its regulation 
 concerning the manner in which VA determines that a Veteran is 
 Catastrophically Disabled (CD) for purposes of enrollment Priority Group 
 4.  The current regulation relies on specific codes from the ICD-9-CM and 
 CPT.  It has been requested to eliminate the use of ICD-9-CM and CPT 
 codes when adding or updating the Veterans' CD data.  The Health 
 Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the
 Enrollment System (ES) and VistA Registration, Enrollment and
 Eligibility (Vista REE) software to support the requirements for the 
 Catastrophic Disability Initiative.  This patch modifies the HL7 Z07
 consistency check rules for the ZCD segments. 
  
 This patch modifies the Income Verification Match v2.0 application as 
 described below:
  
  
 1. If the VETERAN CATASTROPHICALLY DISABLED? (#.39) field of the 
    PATIENT (#2) file equals "Y" and no CD DESCRIPTORS are on file,  CD 
    STATUS DIAGNOSES, CD STATUS PROCEDURES and CD STATUS CONDITIONS will be 
    sent on the HL7 Z07 message.
  
 2. If the VETERAN CATASTROPHICALLY DISABLED? (#.39) field of the PATIENT 
    (#2) file equals "Y" and new CD STATUS DESCRIPTORS are on File, CD 
    DESCRIPTORS in lieu of CD STATUS DIAGNOSES, CD STATUS PROCEDURES and CD 
    STATUS CONDITIONS will be sent on the HL7 Z07 message.
  
 3. If the VETERAN CATASTROPHICALLY DISABLED? (#.39) field of the PATIENT 
    (#2) file equals "N", it will not send anything.
