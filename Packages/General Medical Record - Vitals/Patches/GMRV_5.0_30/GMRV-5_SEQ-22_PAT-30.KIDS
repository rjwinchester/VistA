This patch will include the creation of a new field that will incorporate 
"BLD",9729,1,2,0)
data from the respective Standards Development Organization (SDO) to the 
"BLD",9729,1,3,0)
Vitals Type (#120.51), Vitals Qualifier (#120.52) and Vitals Category 
"BLD",9729,1,4,0)
(#120.53) files. 
"BLD",9729,1,5,0)
The Vital Type, Vital Qualifier, and Vital Category  files will be 
"BLD",9729,1,6,0)
addressed during this effort due to the nature of the data within these 
"BLD",9729,1,7,0)
files that are necessary for referencing, reporting, and interoperability 
"BLD",9729,1,8,0)
purposes. 
"BLD",9729,1,9,0)
The following three files are associated with the Vital Signs Domain:
"BLD",9729,1,10,0)
Vitals Type File (#120.51): This file contains a list of vital 
"BLD",9729,1,11,0)
sign types, for example, height, weight, and temperature
"BLD",9729,1,12,0)
Vitals Qualifier File (#120.52): Description of how the patient 
"BLD",9729,1,13,0)
vital signs and measurements were taken. Categorized by location (e.g., 
"BLD",9729,1,14,0)
right arm, left leg), position (e.g., lying, sitting, standing), method 
"BLD",9729,1,15,0)
(e.g., cuff, Doppler, assisted ventilator, etc.), site (e.g., right, 
"BLD",9729,1,16,0)
left), quality (e.g., actual, estimated), and cuff size (e.g., adult, 
"BLD",9729,1,17,0)
small adult, pediatric).
"BLD",9729,1,18,0)
Vitals Category File (#120.53): This file contains the cuff size, 
"BLD",9729,1,19,0)
location, method, position, quality, and site of the vitals which are 
"BLD",9729,1,20,0)
simply ways of grouping qualifiers which store the important data.
"BLD",9729,1,21,0)
GMRV VITAL TYPE (#120.51) file shall be updated to include a new field to 
"BLD",9729,1,22,0)
store LOINC code field from the respective SDO. The new field s shall be 
"BLD",9729,1,23,0)
set as a multiple in order to accommodate the potential future need to 
"BLD",9729,1,24,0)
utilize an additional or different code type, such as CPT, for 
"BLD",9729,1,25,0)
association with a given Vital Type term. The data gathered from the 
"BLD",9729,1,26,0)
needed LOINC CT mapping effort will be used to populate this field.
"BLD",9729,1,27,0)
GMRV VITAL QUALIFIER (#120.52) file shall be updated to include a new 
"BLD",9729,1,28,0)
field to store the SNOMED CT code from the respective SDO. The new field 
"BLD",9729,1,29,0)
shall be set as a multiple in order to accommodate multiple SNOMED CT 
"BLD",9729,1,30,0)
codes per term within file 120.52, since there may be one-to-many 
"BLD",9729,1,31,0)
relationships in addition to one-to-one relationships when the active 
"BLD",9729,1,32,0)
terms in files 120.52 are associated to SNOMED CT codes. The data 
"BLD",9729,1,33,0)
gathered from the needed SNOMED CT mapping effort will be used to 
"BLD",9729,1,34,0)
populate this field.
"BLD",9729,1,35,0)
GMRV VITAL CATEGORY (#120.53) file shall be updated to include a new 
"BLD",9729,1,36,0)
field to store the SNOMED CT code from the respective SDO. The new field 
"BLD",9729,1,37,0)
shall be set as a multiple in order to accommodate multiple SNOMED CT 
"BLD",9729,1,38,0)
codes per term within file 120.53 since there may be one to many 
"BLD",9729,1,39,0)
relationships in addition to one to one when the active terms in files 
"BLD",9729,1,40,0)
120.53 are associated to SNOMED CT codes. The data gathered from the

'ACTIVE', then the term will be accessible by end-users to document a
