Subject: HELP FILE UPDATE FOR WIN 10 AND DELPHI UPGRADE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch resolves the following issues in the Vitals Lite 
 Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) file, and the Vitals Manager and Vitals
 Standalone applications (altogether known as the Vitals Suite):
  
 1. While evaluating Windows 10, it was discovered that the Help files
 would not display correctly. This patch corrects this problem by
 converting the help files to a new format.
 2. The Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Information and Technology
 requires that applications remain compliant with the Technical Reference
 Model (TRM) regarding the version of tools used for development. This
 patch accomplishes this by updating the version of Delphi to XE10.2.
