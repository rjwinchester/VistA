Subject: FIX LOADING HELP VIA NETWORK INSTALL

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues in the Vitals and Vitals 
 Manager applications:
 - Help file will not load on a network install of the GUI
 - Ability to select self in patient selection
 - Prevent entering Vitals for a future date
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. I16167260FY17 - 31a Production Site Vitals Help files not opening 
 Problem:
 -------
 The new update to vitals help will not open and is creating an error
 when the user(s) try to open it. The network share use requires a patch
 that may have not been added previously for a known issue related to the
 .HLP files security permissions on the network. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This did not have to do with CPRS 31a but has been an issue in the Vitals
 and Vitals Manager application since the move to Windows 7. The
 applications will now check if the application is running on a network 
 install and if so, it will download/update the help file to the local 
 machine (as needed) and then make reference to this file instead of the 
 network instance.
  
 2. I9882201FY16 - Ability to select self as a patient
 Problem:
 -------
 The user is allowed to select themselves as a patient in Vitals GUI. This
 causes a side effect in CPRS via CCOW and then allows CPRS to
 bypass the same user/patient selection prevention.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Correct the Vitals GUI so that this check prevents the selection of the
 same user/patient.
  
 3. I16439040FY17 - Editing issues in Vitals GUI through CPRS 
 Problem:
 -------
 A nursing Assistant entered a Vital sign for a future time and you are 
 not supposed to be able to do this. Tried to do it on a test patient 
 and get a message - Vitals cannot be entered in the future.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Ensured that a future time is not selectable.
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 Salt Lake City
 Tuscaloosa

 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
