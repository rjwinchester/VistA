Subject: VITALS/VITALS MANAGER GUI 2FA IMPLEMENTATION

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will update the log in procedure to the Vitals User and Vitals 
 Manager Graphical User Interface (GUI) to use Two Factor Authentication
 (2FA) which will require the use of a Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
 card.
  
 In order to make the transition to 2FA, it was also necessary to 
 upgrade the Vitals User and Vitals Manager GUI to Delphi version XE8 in
 order to implement the new Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker allowing
 compliance.
  
 Note: Patch GMRV*5.0*27 includes a new GUI within the .MSI executable.

 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 The Department of Veterans Affairs Cybersecurity Task Force has been 
 tasked by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Inspector General
 (IG) to address identified material weaknesses. This task force has
 mandated that all internal, user facing VA applications become two factor
 authentication (2FA) compliant by April 30, 2017.
  
 In order to be compliant, applications are required to authenticate users 
 via Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards.  
  
 Note: Usernames and password will no longer be permitted for employees and
       contractors to access VA applications.  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 As part of the transition to 2FA, Vitals User and Vitals Manager were 
 upgraded to Delphi XE8 to allow access to the latest version of the RPC
 Broker implementing 2FA.
