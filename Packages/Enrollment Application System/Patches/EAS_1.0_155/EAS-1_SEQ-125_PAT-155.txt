 565313      Problem: Resolve Fortify findings as per scan of ESR Mars Dev
             stream.
 
             Resolution: Code was updated to resolve Fortify findings as per
             scan of ESR Mars Dev stream.
 
 569545      Problem: UFT-FDD Summary Report shows incorrect number of
             records.
  
             Resolution: The Selection option was updated to match the detail
             report. Only FDD entries with a valid entry in the PSIM report
             table will be counted.
  
 571558      Problem: CC Manual Override Error message show up when user
             manual override from the new record VCE is No data available to
             Basic.
  
             Resolution: The issue was fixed by forcing a cache refresh of the
             person. Refresh the person record in ES before doing the CC
             override by clicking the "Person Search" hyperlink located in the
             upper-left.
  
 577667      Problem: Resolve Fortify Formula findings as per scan of ESR Mars
             Dev stream dated 08/22/2017.
  
             Resolution: Updated code to remove Fortify High Finding Formula
             Injection blacklist characters such as =, +, - and @ from
             spreadsheet contents.
  
 579544      Problem: DOD - Sometimes ES UI displays incorrect Source of
             Notification other than what was received from MVI.
  
             Resolution: Updated code to ensure that the code interpreted is
             for code="DOD_SOURCE" to display correct Source of Notification.
  
 580551      Problem: DOD - Should not recalculate Enrollment End Date when
             there is no update to date of death.
  
             Resolution: Updated by making the comparison ahead of the rule
             calls. Once the process demographic rule has been completed the
             Boolean result of the comparison is sent to calculate EE
             flow. This is used further down in the calculatedDateOfDeath
             demographic input parameter.
  
 583130      Problem: Wait Time VISN Number is not showing up in TPA file.
  
             Resolution: Updated with the VISN number correction in the
             BatchProcess to display the Wait Time VISN Number in the TPA
             file.
  
 583587      Problem: Veteran Records erroring out from SSA Response Files.

             for an Updated Address with a USPS Return File.
  
             Resolution: Modified the order of check between letters 742-652A
             and 742-652 for the history records.
  
 585915      Problem: CC History page does not show residential address or
             wait-time/hardship data.
  
             Resolution: Updated the VC History page to show all the
             residential address or wait-time/hardship data.
  
 586483      Problem: The SSN field in ZDP in the Z10 message is being
             populated with object reference rather than SSN value.
  
             Resolution: Updated code to fix Z10 segment outputting SSN object
             reference and commented out code to reset buffer.
  
 587140      Problem: CC Override history is sometimes displayed out of order.
  
             Resolution: Fixed the code where there is a date value getting

 589835      Problem: ES is removing 'X' manual override.
  
             Resolution: The ETL handling the CC Eligibility was changed to
             not update the CCE changes when the record is marked with Manual
             Override value of 'X'. Only if the CC Eligibility change is due
             to Enrollment / Eligibility changes will it remove the Manual
             Override from 'X'.
  
 589937      Problem: 1302 message from ES to MVI sends imprecise DOD
             (mm/yyyy) in wrong format.
  
             Resolution: A new format was created for formatWithTimeImpl to
             cater for the imprecise YYYYMM format to be sent.
  
 590287      Problem: UI: Search results exceeding 1,000 error message is
             displayed, but first 1,000 results are missing.
 
             Resolution: Code changes were made to the PaginatedQueryExecuter
            (subclass) to allow search results of up to 1,000 to return along
             with the error message.
 
 591215      Problem: Manage CCN Contractors screen - An 's' is missing from
             Manage CCN Contractors title, and page number/totals are missing.
  
             Resolution: Page numbers are not needed in the State-Regions page
             and the Manage Contractors page. Updated the
             AdminMessages.properties file to add 's' to the missing label
             (Manage CCN Contractors) title.
  
 595867      Problem: CC HBP Veterans Choice Wait-Time - The hyphen is missing
             from the name in ES (Veteran Plan - Veterans Choice Wait-Time).
 
             Resolution: Submit a request to SDS to update one row in
             STD_HEALTHBENEFITPLAN table. Update the NAME for row with CODE
             202 (ID 1812497) to this: 'Veteran Plan - Veterans Choice Wait-
             Time'.
 
 597458      Problem: Community Care page not rendering.
  
             Resolution:  Updated the vcDetermination.jsp' file, added
             <c:choose> </choose > for st1 Element The Community Care
