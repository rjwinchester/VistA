 Problem:
 ----------
 464842 - SDM ticket I12029434FY17: When a user changes a Veteran's Preferred
 Facility in ES, the DGEN mail bulletin that notifies the site the person was
 added is being sent to all sites of record. That bulletin should go only to
 the Preferred Facility.
 492249 - The VISN column in the Time Eligibility table on the CC Viewer is
 displaying the database identifier rather than the VISN number (e.g.,
 "1501391" rather than "11").
 503810 - Remediate Fortify Critical and High findings by resolving ESM
 Critical Priority LDAP Injection Security Vulnerability.
 509010 - Remediate Fortify Critical and High findings by resolving ESM
 Critical Priority Cross-Site Scripting Reflected and Log Forging
 Vulnerabilities.
 
 Resolution:
 ----------
 464842 - Added sendEmailBulletinPrefSiteOnly method to
 CommsEmailBulletinService and updated call on HEC_NOTIFY_SITE_PERSON_ADDED in
 VOAApplicationServiceImpl.
 492249 - Changed the VAFacility to get the VISN ID.
 503810 - Updated Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) code to extend the
 filtering logic to include additional metacharacters from LDAP query as per
 Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) recent additions.
 509010 - Updated ESR code to extend the removal of XSS attack patterns from
 getParameterNames(), getHeaderNames(), and getInputStream().
