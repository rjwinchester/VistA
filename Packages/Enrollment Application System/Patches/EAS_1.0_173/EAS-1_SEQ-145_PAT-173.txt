Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) 5.5 RELEASE

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The purpose of this informational patch description is to announce the 
 release of the Enrollment System (ES) 5.5. This release, developed in Java
 technology, contains Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 
 development and upgrade efforts, including enhancements to support 
 Community Care (CC) and ES Sustainment.
  
 ES 5.5 was successfully deployed on Saturday, February 16th, 2019.
  
 The following functionality is updated in this ES 5.5 release:
  
 ESM
 1. ES is modified to allow the storage, display, and transmission of the
    Medal of Honor (MOH) Award Date. Changes include:
      - Military Service Data Sharing (MSDS) interface reads and stores the
        MOH award date
      - The Administrative Data Repository (ADR) stores the MOH award date
      - The ES user interface displays and allows modifications of the MOH
        award date
      - The Z11 Health Level 7 (HL7) message includes the MOH award date
        and MOH status update date
        - Note: VistA sites receive the MOH award date and MOH status
          update date from ES and process MOH as Priority Group 1 after
          installation of patch DG*5.3*972.
  
 2. ES is enhanced to allow automatic population and manual sending of the 
    Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Early Elective Delivery (EED)
    60-Day Pre-Term and Eligibility letters listed below; display of a
    60-Day countdown; and display of a 60-Day ineligible banner.
      - VHA-EED Decision Notice 60-Day Pre-Term Initial Other Than Hon-DVA 
        (IB 10-1206)
      - VHA-EED Decision Notice 60-Day Pre-Term Initial Less Than 24 Months
        (IB 10-1205)
      - VHA-EED Decision Notice 60-Day Pre-Term Initial Active Duty For
        Training (IB 10-1204)
      - VHA-EED Decision Notice 60-Day Pre-Term Final Other Than Hon-DVA 
        (IB 10-1203)
      - VHA-EED Decision Notice Template-60-Day Final Less Than 24 Months 
        (IB 10-1202)
      - VHA-EED Decision Notice 60-Day Pre-Term Final Active Duty for 
        Training (IB 10-1201)
      - VHA-EED Decision Notice - Ineligible Less Than 24 Months (IB 
        10-1208)   
      - VHA-EED Decision Notice - Ineligible Other Than Hon-DVA (IB 
        10-1207)
      - VHA-EED Decision Notice - Ineligible Active Duty for Training (IB 
        10-1200)
      - VHA-EED Decision Notice 60-Day Pre-Term Status (IB 10-1199)
  
 Enrollment System Community Care (ESCC)
 1. ES is modified to include a Menu Option on the Main Menu titled 
    "Letters" and two new screens titled "Manage Letters" and "Letter
    Change History". This will enable an authorized ES Administrator User
    to activate or deactivate the ESCC Letters. In addition, a history
    screen, which follows similar patterns of history screens in ES,
    showing the letter activations and deactivations, is implemented.
 2. The ES Eligibility and Enrollment (E&E) Web Service is modified to 
    include the capability to share Community Care Eligibility Information
    and Health Benefit Plans (HBPs) with other VA Systems.
 3. ES has optimized and sped up the Community Care Veteran Eligibility and
    Enrollment process. Where possible, the Decision Flow has been changed 
    to a rules-based process versus the existing extract, transform, load
    (ETL) jobs process:
      - Provide real-time Veterans Choice Eligibility (VCE) for a Veteran
        that changes from eligible to ineligible so that users have access
        to VCE information while updating the Veteran.
      - Provide real-time VCE for Residential Address (Permanent Address if
        Residential is not available) additions or changes so that users 
        have access to VCE information while updating the Veteran.
      - Provide real-time VCE for Enrollment Status additions or updates so
        that users have access to VCE information while updating the 
        Veteran.
      - Make the VCE Determination information from backend processing
        available to users throughout the day so that users don't have to 
        wait a day for results.
 4. ES is enhanced to capture additional data requirements regarding 
    rurality data and the display of this data in the E&E Web Services
    graphical user interface (GUI) as well as implementation of backend
    changes to the Administrative Data Repository (ADR) Database.
  
 Operational Decision Management (ODM)
 1. For the iLOG to ODM project, the 71 iLOG rule sets were transferred 
    from iLOG to ODM.  A Mediation Framework was established to allow the
    ES user to switch between the iLOG and ODM rules sets as the rules sets
    are integrated into the ES application. ES 5.5 integrates rule sets
    that support the Person Eligibility and Process Demographics
    functionalities. Screen functionality is unchanged by the upgraded
    rules.

 RTC #       Problem / Resolution:
 --------    --------------------
 707138      Problem: The user is unable to see the 1010EZ PDF from the
             Enrollment tab if the Health Care Application (HCA) had a
             Future Discharge Date (FDD).
             Resolution: Updated the template to the new 1010EZ form that 
             will handle FDD.
  
 713960      Problem: VCE determination not using driving distance if
             Residential Line 1 is a P.O. Box.
             Resolution: The P.O. Box rule is implemented in real-time VCE
             rules. An address is considered P.O. Box only if the address 
             line 1 contains P.O. Box/General Delivery or its variants, and
             if the address line 2 and address line 3 are blank.
  
 793995      Problem: Section 508: When input errors are automatically
             detected, the item that is an error is not identified and
             described to the user in text.
             Resolution: Updated 508 text.
  
 831926      Problem: ORU-Z05 should be triggered to all sites when an
             Emergency Contact update is received via ORU-Z07.
             Resolution: Change made in AssociationInputParameter.java and
             MessageEventInputParameter.java.
             MessageEventInputParameter.updateMessageEvents() modified to 
             add ContactType instead of entity keys to determine the need
             to trigger a Z05 message.
  
 841215      Problem: Duplicate ORU-Z05 is triggered when personal email
             address is added/updated from ES.
             Resolution: Disabled Z05 message when the caller was UI and 
             email type is personal as Z05 from this path was managed by
             VET360.            
  
 841264      Problem: Z07 update with non-demographics update removes and
             inserts the email address that is on file, which in turn 
             triggers a Z05.
             Resolution: Updated method to find email by type when 
             processing electronic address.
  
 842415      Problem: Home phone numbers deleted from ES are being retained
             in VistA.
             Resolution: Implemented code changes for ES to send empty 
             phone number in the PID segment in case of DELETE - if the
             phone is not on file and if the most recent entry in the
             history table for this type of phone is DELETE, then add an
             empty phone in the PID.
  
 854971      Problem: Incorrect phone format does not trigger a Z05.
             Resolution: Added Z05 triggering when VET360 returns error on
             phone.
  
 871695      Problem: The Print 1010EZ Button in the Financials Screen is
             displaying an outdated 1010EZ Form.
             Resolution: The Print 1010EZ button in the Financials tab was
             updated to use the 2017 version of the 1010EZ form. Mapping 
             code for new fields was added where applicable.
  
 871699      Problem: The Print 1010EZR Button in the Financials Screen is
             displaying an outdated 1010EZR Form.
             Resolution: The Print 1010EZR Button in the Financials tab was
             updated to display the 2017 version of the 1010EZR form. 
             Mapping code was implemented for new form fields where
             applicable.
