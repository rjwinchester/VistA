 --------    ---------------------
  
 988927:     Problem: In the Community Care Network (CCN) file, the
             residential address effective date is reflecting the effective
             date of the permanent mailing address.
  
             Resolution: Corrected the SQL query to retrieve the relevant
             data.
  
 989189:     Problem: Status is "Error" when the CCN initial seeding 
             extract job is run with over a million records.
  
             Resolution: Updated the job to use the Stateless session bean.
  
 995263:     Problem: Person merge is failing due to an issue with 
             appointment request. Add a Person is also failing when the
             application data is saved in process prior to ES 5.6 release
             and contains appointment request fields; user is unable to
             retrieve previous saved application data. (YOUR IT Services
             ticket#: INC5572969)
  
             Resolution: Updated code to handle person merge appointment
             request mapping and merging, enable backward compatibility for
             appointment request data, and handle old appointment request
             data.
  
 996848:     Problem: When updating the permanent mailing address, no 
             record is inserted in the CCN Service Log; the existing record
             is updated instead.
  
             Resolution: Addressed bug in code that was not checking for 
             the CCN Service Log message type - corrected code to check if
             there is an existing unsent unsolicited transaction and update
             it; otherwise create a new unsolicited record.
  
 996912:     Problem: Adding new non-Community Care Program (CCP) health
             benefit plan (HBP) is removing existing CCP HBPs.

             Resolution: Online Help updated per User Guide; updated the 
             help id to 495 (helpId.VC_Eligibility=495).
  
 1003897:    Problem: CCN Region is shown blank for the states with two 
             words in their names. State/region lookup needs to be case
             insensitive.
  
             Resolution: Updated SQL to ignore the case while comparing the
             state names.
  
 1003903:    Problem: CCN Region should be derived from the residential
             address.
  
             Resolution: Corrected the code to derive the CCN Region using 
             the residential address.
  
 1008146:    Problem: Addresses with bad address reason
             (address_invalid_type_id) are not being geocoded.
  
             Resolution: The bad address indicator column
             (address_invalid_type_id) should not be used to exclude
             residential address records that are sent to Planning System
             Support Group (PSSG) for geocoding. Removed bad address 
             indicator filtering on residential addresses.
  
 1011367:    Problem: After VCEParameter batch process, some records retain
             the original Veterans Choice Eligibility (VCE).
  
             Resolution: Used new variable for VCEmanualoverride in ILOG
             rules.
  
 1011369:    Problem: After VCEParameter batch process, some records have a
             VCE of "Not Determined".
  
             Resolution: Used new variable for VCEmanualoverride in ILOG
             rules.
  
 1016492:    Large CCN files cannot be transferred to Data Access Service
             (DAS).

             reading the file content into memory.
