 The Geographic-Based Means Test (GMT) thresholds for Calendar Year 2018
 are distributed with this patch. The updated values for the GMT
 THRESHOLDS file (#712.5) are used in the determination of a veteran's
 GMT Threshold for a given income year, based on locality and number of
 dependents.
   
 Geographical income level thresholds are set yearly by the U.S. Department
 of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This large set of income
 thresholds is usually referred to as the HUD index. The geographic based
 income limits for Income Year (IY) 2017 can be found January 1, 2018 at:
 http://www.domain.ext/healthbenefits/cost/income_thresholds.asp
  
 This patch, EAS*1.0*154, is one of three VistA 2018 threshold patches.  It
 addresses the annual updates for the GMT Thresholds. Patch DG*5.3*949 will
 update the thresholds for the Means Tests and the Maximum Annual Pension
 Rate. Patch IB*2.0*611 will address the annual updates for the Pharmacy
 Copay Thresholds.
