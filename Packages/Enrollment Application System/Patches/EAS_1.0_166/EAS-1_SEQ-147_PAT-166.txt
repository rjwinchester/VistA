Subject: INFORMATIONAL - ESR/MVR VIE TO HEALTH CONNECT MIGRATION

Category: 
  - Informational
  - Other

Description:
============

  **************************************************************************
    This is an informational patch describing the migration from Vitria
    Interface Engine (VIE) to InterSystems Health Connect (HC). HC is a
    part of the suite of products grouped under HealthShare.
    **************************************************************************
     
   The Health Connect (HC) product will be replacing the Vitria Interface 
   Engine (VIE). During the transition phase, HC and VIE will be running
   concurrently.
  
  A phased deployment is planned at an enterprise level. This patch, 
  EAS*1*166, is for the migration of Health Level 7 (HL7) messaging 
  between the VistA, Enrollment System Redesign (ESR), and Master
  Veteran Record (MVR) systems.  In the initial deployment of this patch,
  HL7 communications from the VistA systems to the ESR (inbound to ESR)
  will be via HC; and the communications from the ESR (outbound from ESR) 
  to VistA systems will be via VIE.  The next phase of deployment
  will have all communications between VistA systems and ESR processed with
  HC.

  *************************************************************************
        The following instructions are to be performed only when directed
        to do so by the Healthshare National Admin Team. These changes can
        only be implemented in collaboration and coordination with site

 Installation Instructions  
 -------------------------
 After HealthShare/Health Connect is deployed, and the Health Connect 
 Regional Production instance is ready to process incoming and outgoing 
 messages, the HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870) for the LLESROUT entry will 
 need to be modified. The ESR servers and VistA logical link will need 
 to point to an IP address and port for Health Connect production. 
 
 The following steps will have to be performed in the VistA HL7 application 
 for the LLESROUT outbound logical link entry:
   
  Step 1.  Stop the LLESROUT logical link with HL7 Menu option: Start/Stop 
           Links. The following is an example:
     
   Select OPTION NAME: HL7 MAIN MENU  HL MAIN MENU     HL7 Main Menu
   
            Event monitoring menu ...
            Systems Link Monitor
            Filer and Link Management Options ...  <===
            Message Management Options ...
            Interface Developer Options ...
            Site Parameter Edit
     HLO    HL7 (Optimized) MAIN MENU ...
   
  Select HL7 Main Menu <TEST ACCOUNT> Option: FILER AND LINK Management 
                                              Options
   
     SM     Systems Link Monitor
     FL     Monitor, Start, Stop Filers
     LM     TCP Link Manager Start/Stop
     SA     Stop All Messaging Background Processes
     RA     Restart/Start All Links and Filers
     DF     Default Filers Startup
     SL     Start/Stop Links  <===
     PI     Ping (TCP Only)
     ED     Link Edit
     ER     Link Errors ...
   
  Select Filer and Link Management Options <TEST ACCOUNT> Option: sl  
                                                         
  This option is used to launch the lower level protocol for the
  appropriate device.  Please select the node with which you want
  to communicate
   
  Select HL LOGICAL LINK NODE: LLESROUT
 
  The LLP was last started on MAR 07, 2019 12:17:34.
  
  Okay to shut down this job? YES
  The job for the LLESROUT Lower Level Protocol will be shut down.
  
  Step 2.   Edit the LLESROUT Logical Link with the Link Edit HL7 menu option: 
   
     SM     Systems Link Monitor
     FL     Monitor, Start, Stop Filers
     LM     TCP Link Manager Start/Stop
     SA     Stop All Messaging Background Processes
     RA     Restart/Start All Links and Filers
     DF     Default Filers Startup
     SL     Start/Stop Links
     PI     Ping (TCP Only)
     ED     Link Edit     <===
     ER     Link Errors ...
   
  Select HL LOGICAL LINK NODE:    LLESROUT
   
   Step 3. On the first screen, change AUTOSTART to Enabled. 
   Next, move the cursor to the field LLP TYPE and press Enter. 
   This will present the second screen (as shown is step 5).
  
   Step 4. On the first screen, edit the DNS DOMAIN field as 
   instructed below.
