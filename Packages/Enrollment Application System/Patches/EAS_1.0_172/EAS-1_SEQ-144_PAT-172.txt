Subject: CLEANUP OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS IN INCOME PERSON (#408.13) FILE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is part of Your IT Services incident INC1928289 to fix a 
 critical defect introduced by Enrollment System (ES) 5.3 and corrected
 by 5.3.0.070001, where the dependent Social Security Number (SSN) data at
 the Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) facilities was corrupted and requires a VistA patch to clean up
 the database corruption.
  
 Please refer to the IVM*2.0*174 patch description for a description of the
 problem and its resolution.
  
 EAS*1.0*172 is being released with IVM*2.0*174 in Host File
 IVM_20_P174.KID.
  
  
 Listing of Updates:
 ===================
 Patch EAS*1.0*172 modifies routine PROC^EASCM for the processing of the
 HL7 ORU-Z10 message from ES to initialize a variable IVMSSNFLAG before
 calling the code that parses the message.  Upon returning from that
 routine, if the variable is set to "1", the code quits and does not
 process the message further, otherwise the message is processed normally.
  
 Code block before installation of EAS*1.0*172:
  ; - check HL7 msg structure for errors
  K HLERR,^TMP($J,"IVMCM")
  D ^IVMCMC I $D(HLERR) K:HLERR="" HLERR Q
  ;
  
 Code block after installation of EAS*1.0*172:
  ; - check HL7 msg structure for errors
  K HLERR,^TMP($J,"IVMCM")
  ; jam; EAS*1.0*172 - set IVMSSNFLAG=0 and quit processing if the flag is 
 set upon return from ^IVMCMC
  ;  (see ^IVMCMC for what sets this flag)
  N IVMSSNFLAG
  S IVMSSNFLAG=0
  D ^IVMCMC I $D(HLERR) K:HLERR="" HLERR Q
  I IVMSSNFLAG Q
  ;
