Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) APPLICATION, VERSION 4.0.4

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The purpose of this informational patch is to announce the release of the
 Enrollment System (ES) 4.0.4 application version software. 
  
 ES 4.0.4 is a maintenance release of the Enrollment System Core (ESC) 
 application. This version applies 2 updates to correct critical code 
 defects introduced in previous ES releases.  
  
 The following defects were corrected:
  
 1.   CCR 11534. Corrected Z10 Builder logic to place the correct source of test
      indicator when receiving site is grandchild. 
  
 2.   CCR 13415. Corrected handling of Null gender codes send in identity traits
      from MVI. 
  
  
 What to Expect:
 --------------
 No changes to any VistA packages are required. During deployment of ES 
 4.0.4 HL7 messaging to and from ES will be disabled. Implementation is 
 expected to take less than 2 hours. 
  
  
 Implementation:
 --------------
 ESR 4.0.4 is a centrally managed web-based application and will be
 implemented as a one-time rollout by the ES Technical team and the AITC. 
 No software will be installed at the facilities. ES application will be 
 unavailable and Veteran enrollment determinations will be delayed until 
 the deployment is complete.  
 
 Messaging to/from the sites as well as E&E web services will be 
 unavailable during the deployment. An ANR will be created to announce the 
 deployment which will list all impacted systems and to track the outage.

 Remedy Tickets & Overview:
 -------------------------
 Problem:
 -------
 1.  Remedy Ticket # 1029515 identified an issue where a financial assessment
 conducted by a grandchild satellite site of the transmitting site was causing
 the Z10 builder to send a SOURCE OF TEST as 'OTHER FACILITY' rather than
 'VAMC'.  The result is the owning site not being able to edit the Means/RX
 Copay test, if necessary, once the message is received and uploaded.  The
 parent facility of 657GJ is a child facility of 657A5, which in turn, is a
 child facility of site 657.  The ES views a financial assessment conducted by
 657GJ as having a parent of 657A5, since this did not match the receiving
 facility of 657, the ZMT-18 was being set to a code of '4' (Other Facility).  
 The ORF/ORU Z10 builder logic is modified to recognize the Site Conducting Test
 as a grandchild to the receiving facility and set the Source of Test as '1'
 (VAMC).  This will allow the 'owning' site to edit the means / RX Copay test as
 necessary. 
                                                                        
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Refactored Z10 builder logic to correctly identify when a receiving site is
 grandchild and appropriately set the Source of Test indicator as VAMC.
  
 Problem:
 -------
 2.  #1080567. ES application displays stack trace error for veteran identity
 traits received without an identified gender. Impacted records cannot be
 searched, edited, or added; resulting in delay of enrollment determination.   
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Corrected ES person logic to allow null/unidentified gender to be passed in and
 accepted without error. Removed duplicate person retrieval searches upon Add a
 Person which was compounding the seeding of this issue.
