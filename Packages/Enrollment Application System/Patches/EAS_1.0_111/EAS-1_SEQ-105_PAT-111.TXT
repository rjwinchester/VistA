Description:
============

  *****************************************************************************
  Note:  This patch is being released in support of the Enrollment Customer
         Enhancements (ECE) and Enrollment System Enhancements (ESE) projects
         and the Enrollment System (ES) 3.12 release.  EAS*1*111 (Enrollment
         Application System) is released with DG*5.3*865 (Registration) and
         EAS*1*107 (Enrollment Application System) in host file DG_53_P865.KID.
   
         It is imperative that this patch be installed no later than the
         compliance date.  Your understanding and support is appreciated.
  *****************************************************************************
   
  The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the
  Enrollment System (ES), and VistA Registration, Enrollment and Eligibility
  (VistA REE) software to support the requirements of the Receive
  Conversion/Reversal Tests from ES initiative.
   
  This patch modifies the Enrollment Application System v1.0 application as
  described below:
   
  1.  Add protocols to support ORU Z06 messages from ESR for
      Converted/Reversed tests.
   
     - New entries in the Protocol file #101 have been created to support
       ORU Z06 from ESR.  New ORU (Unsolicited transmission type) protocols
       have been added for inbound messages:
        (where nnn is the VistA site number)
         EAS ESR nnn ORU-Z06 SERVER
         EAS ESR nnn ORU-Z06 CLIENT
   
    The post-install routine EAS1111P will define the protocols associated
    with this patch.  The protocols are active with the install of the patch.
   
  2.  VistA will not send an ORU Z07 back to ESR when it processes an ORU
      Z06 from ESR.
   
     - The ORU Z07 message to ESR will be suppressed when an ORU Z06 is
       processed.
   
  3.  Processing converted and reversed tests for ESR.
   
     - VistA will accept an ORU Z06 message even when a Converted Means
       Test or Rx Copay Test associated with the Means Test is not on file
       for the income year being converted.  When processing a Converted
       Means Test or Converted Rx Copay Test associated with the Means
       Test, VistA will accept the test even if a test is not on file for
       the converted income year.
   
  4.  Reversed test.
   
     - VistA will accept a Z06 message when a Reversed Means Test or Rx
       Copay Test associated with the Means Test is received from ESR.  
       There will be no restrictions on the Means Test Status or Rx Copay
       Status in order to Reverse a Means Test or an Rx Copay Test.

  Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
  =====================================
  Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
  patch is available.
   
  The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.  This transmits the files from the first
  available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly
  from a specific server as follows:
   
         OI&T FIELD OFFICE       FTP ADDRESS                DIRECTORY
         -----------------       -----------                ---------
