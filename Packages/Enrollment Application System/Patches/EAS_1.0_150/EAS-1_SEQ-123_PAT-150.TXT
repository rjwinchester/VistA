Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The purpose of this Informational Patch is to announce the release of the
 Enrollment System (ES) 4.6.3. This release, developed in Java technology,
 contains Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) sustainment efforts.
  
 The ES 4.6.3 release addresses a defect in which a user's attempt to 
 generate a 1010EZ form from 1) the Financials tab results in an
 "Application Error" or 2) the Enrollment tab results in ES displaying an
 empty PDF form. Thus, users are unable to process applications received
 from the online Healthcare Application (HCA).
