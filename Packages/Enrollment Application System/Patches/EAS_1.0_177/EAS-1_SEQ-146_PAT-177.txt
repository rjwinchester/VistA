 --------    --------------------
 944306      Problem: A SQL query, introduced by ES 5.5, caused a severe
             system performance degradation (see Informational Patch
             EAS*1*173, deployed 02/16/2019). The problem is the system is
             unable to extend the temp segment by 128 in the tablespace 
             TEMP.
             Resolution: Tuned the SQL query for performance and 
             management of TEMP tablespace.
  
  
 945034      Problem: Records that are Veterans Choice Eligibility (VCE)
             status Not Determined (ND) are being included in the Third-
             Party Administrator (TPA) positive file.
             Resolution: VCE of ND is excluded as a VCE change; TPA
             positive also excludes VCE of ND.
