Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) 5.4 RELEASE

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The purpose of this informational patch description is to announce the 
 release of the Enrollment System (ES) 5.4. This release, developed in Java
 technology, contains Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 
 development and upgrade efforts, including enhancements to support 
 Community Care (CC) and ES Sustainment.
  
 ES 5.4 was successfully deployed on Saturday, November 17th, 2018.
  
 The following functionality is updated in this ES 5.4 release:
  
 ESM:
 1. ES is updated to no longer filter outgoing Z05 Demographic Data 
    Transmission HL7 messages to VistA sites based on sender or content. 
    Changes include updating the decision filter process for sending an 
    ORU~Z05 message (Change Request - 768318).
 2. ES is modified to send the Reason for Early Separation Code along with 
    the Reason for Early Separation Description to VistA REE for each
    Military Service Episode.
 3. ES is enhanced to allow users to directly access the Veterans Health 
    Identification Card (VHIC) application. The system will provide the
    user with the ability to access the VHIC system through a hyperlink
    (button) (Change Request - 621847).
 4. The Future Discharge Date (FDD) received from Military Service Data 
    Sharing (MSDS) is unreliable. A configurable switch is added to ES so 
    that ES will check the parameter and only accept the FDD received from 
    MSDS when it is turned on once data quality issues are resolved (Change
    Request - 771257).
  
 ESCC:
 1. Other Health Insurance (OHI) updates and enhancements allow ES to 
    capture additional OHI fields in ES and then send those fields to
    VistA.
 2. A feature has been added that will allow an ES user to view and 
    download historical Third-Party Administrator (TPA) and Community Care
    Network (CCN) data into a comma-separated values (.csv) file format 
    (Change Request - 619088).
 3. In order to send TPA data in a more efficient way and track the status
    of the TPA file in an automated manner, the mechanism has been changed
    from SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) to DAS (Data Access Services)
    for the transfer of the TPA files. The TPA Message Log screen and the
    CCN Contractor Message Search screen are updated (Change Request -
    801907). 
 4. The distance value display on the CC Determination Page is 
    updated to display the distance value up to the eighth decimal place. 
 5. The Administrative Data Repository (ADR) database is changed to 
    capture the values for distance, longitude and latitude sent by
    Planning Systems Support Group (PSSG) instead of explicitly truncating
    these values.
 6. Modifications are made to the Enrollment System Z04 message to: 1) add
    the Source of information codes: 14 "Purchased Care CHOICE" and 3 "IVM"
    so the source of information transmits from ES to the VistA insurance
    buffer. This change provides the Revenue, Insurance Verification Team
    the ability to differentiate the insurance information received from
    CCN contractor (code 14) via the Enrollment System and other insurance
    information sent by the Enrollment System based on online (HCA) and
    user entry (code 3).  2) Add Insured's DOB on the Z04 segment
    transmitted from ES to VistA insurance buffer, this is independent of
    the source of insurance (Change Request - 768328).
  
 ODM
 1. The ES application is configured to switch from iLog Rules legacy 
    to ODM Rules so that the application can use either rule set without 
    having to deploy a new build. All ODM Manage Demographic Validation
    Rules are integrated into the ES application (Change Request - 776089).

 RTC #       Problem / Resolution:
 --------    --------------------
 704193      Problem: The Enrollment System Community Care (ESCC) Detail 
             report is missing on the Health Benefit Plan (HBP) if the VCE
             is set to Mileage and Wait-time, or Hardship and Wait-time.
             Resolution: Reviewed and modified the SQL statement to correct
             the report.
  
 704233      Problem: The ESCC Detail Report does not display correctly if
             the records don't have HBP assigned or records don't have
             Geocoded data. 
             Resolution: Modified the SQL statement to correct the report
             when the records don't have HBP assigned or records don't have
             Geocoded data.
  
 707276      Problem: "commonEvent" transaction failures are occurring due
             to incorrect workflow of the outbound message.
             Resolution: Added a new trigger identity
             (MessageCaseTriggerIdentity) to route the workflow message
             case.
  
 726067      Problem: Some records contain Temporary Mailing Address and 
             Confidential Address when Update Residential/Permanent Mailing
             Address triggers two ORUZ05 messages.
             Resolution: Used "result" person instead of "incoming" person
             to get the address in updateMessageEvents.
  
 727030      Problem: The ORUZ05 sends Business Email Address in lieu of
             Personal Email Address.
             Resolution: Corrected the logic for the ORUZ05 message to
             sites to share Personal Email Address first; if Personal Email
             Address doesn't exist, then look for Business Email Address.
  
 747231      Problem: The Z04 Health Level 7 (HL7) message does not 
             immediately trigger when Other Health Insurance (OHI) is
             received from Community Care Network (CCN).
             Resolution: Corrected the transaction boundaries for the OHI
             File Loader Service.
  
 747232      Problem: Not all records received OHI information in ES when
             Data Access Service (DAS) sent multiple records with OHI
             information to ES.
             Resolution: Corrected the transaction boundaries for the OHI
             File Loader Service.
  
 780561      Problem: Business Event Notification System (BENS) load is 
             causing massive contention on the QRTZ tables and triggers.
             Resolution: Stopped BENS messages from starting any clock or
             trigger event to messageEventQueue. Updated inbound MSDS
             Master Data Base (MDB) dispatch policy to use the same work
             manager as BENS so the rate can be better controlled
             end-to-end.
  
 793942      Problem: Online Help: Non-text content does not have an 
             equivalent text alternative. 
             Resolution: Corrected the broken images throughout the Online
             Help section.
  
 793945      Problem: Online Help: Audio description is not provided for
             all prerecorded video content in synchronized media.
             Resolution: The 36 demonstration videos in Online Help have
             been removed.
  
 793962      Problem: The correct reading sequence cannot be read 
             (programmatically determined).
             Resolution: Implemented corrections to reading sequence.
  
 793968      Problem: Text and images do not have a contrast ratio of at
             least 4.5:1.
             Resolution: Resolved color contrast issues by implementing the
             correct ratio.
  
 793975      Problem: VCE Parameters screen: Text and images do not have a 
             contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. 
             Resolution: Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) has been modified to
             improve the color contrast for the user interface (UI)
             elements, including the information messages.
  
 793984      Problem: Content functionality is not operable through a
             keyboard interface.
             Resolution: Removed (F12) in Home Menu tool tip.
  
 794942      Problem: Bad address check for specific words in address line 
             1 should be removed.

             and VCE_Params_Re-enroll packages.
  
 794955      Problem: Exclusion of records with "Unverified Date of Death
             indicated from Master Veteran Index (MVI) correlation" mail 
             stop reason is needed.
             Resolution: Records with mail stop reason null or mail stop
             reason not equal to "Unverified Date of Death indicated from 
             MVI correlation" are included in ETL jobs.
  
 803252      Problem: System Parameter does not display the first parameter
             "Agent Orange Special Treatment Authority Exp Date:" on the
             UI.
             Resolution: System Parameter has been modified to display the
             first parameter on the UI.
  
 808880      Problem: Nearest Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability
             Act (VACAA) Facility fields are missing data if the country is
             null or Yemen. 
             Resolution: Modified code to accommodate for null or Yemen.
  
 810851      Problem: Messages to Vet360 do not retry when the system goes 
             down.

             process for detecting unavailable states.
  
 811035      Problem: The Performance Monitor Logs are empty.
             Resolution: Corrected the Log4j config to have the appropriate
             default log level for stop watch logger and performance
             interceptor classes.
  
 812299      Problem: Duplicate ORUZ05 messages appear upon phone number
             update in ES.
             Resolution: Added logic to trigger ORUZ05 decision based on
             phone type and caller. For Home, Business, Mobile and Fax
             phone types. No need to trigger ORUZ05 if the caller is not
             Vet360.
  
 817748      Problem: A duplicate ORUZ05 message is triggered while Coding 
             Accuracy Support System (CASS) is in "PROCESSING" status when
             Permanent Mailing Address update is received from VistA via
             ORUZ07 message.
             Resolution: Modified code to get address from "result" person
             instead of "incoming" person.
  
  
 819844      Problem: It takes more than five minutes to open the CCN 
             Contractor Message Log page in the pre-production environment.
             Resolution: Replaced "like in where" clause for Integration
             Control Number (ICN) with "equal" in the CCN search queries.
  
 820560      Problem: Duplicate ORU-Z05 is triggered when Bad Address
             Reason Update is received from VistA via an ORU-Z07 message.
             Resolution: Included Bad Address Reason in address comparison
             and removed association entity key.
  
 822485      Problem: Query message timeouts are being initiated from
             VistA.
             Resolution: Added high priority Java Message Service (JMS)
             queue publisher for dispatch type "RESPOND" to send as JMS
             priority of 9 so that query response trigger events are sorted
             above all the normal "NOTIFY" unsolicited trigger events.
  
 827717      Problem: VOA update erases employment data in ES.
             Resolution: Modified the Process Demographic Employment
             Information sub-flow to only do a removal of address if the
             process isn't from VOA. 
  
 831195      Problem: Logger configuration interface is only displaying
             loggers that are configured in logj.xml.
             Resolution: Added loggers from Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to
             look up from LogManager.
  
 831231      Problem: On TPA File, the Wait-time for Veterans Integrated 
             Services Networks (VISN) number field shows station name
             instead of VISN number.
             Resolution: Modified code to always use VISN_NUMBER.
  
 833670      Problem: On Add a Person (AAP) the Dependency Factors are not
             being saved after the Accept Changes button is clicked.
             Resolution: Changed code to used spouse financial details
             information in AAP.
  
 833671      Problem: On AAP in the Non-Veteran Eligibility Code, the
             Employee is not displayed on the screen after user accepts
             changes and returns to the screen.
             Resolution: Changed code to retrieve the eligibility codes
             from the list of received eligibilities in the person record
             (which are independent of the enrollment determination) in
             scenarios where an enrollment determination does not exist.
             For scenarios where there is an enrollment determination, the
             eligibility codes should be populated as they were before.
