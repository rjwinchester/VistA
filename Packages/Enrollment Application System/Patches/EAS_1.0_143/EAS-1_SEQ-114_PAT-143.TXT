Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) APPLICATION, VERSION 4.4.1

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The purpose of this informational patch is to announce the release of the
 Enrollment System (ES) 4.4.1 application version software. 
  
 ES 4.4.1 requires deployment of Java software to dedicated servers at the
 Austin Information Technology Center (AITC).  No action is required by 
 VistA sites.
  
 ES 4.4.1 is a maintenance release of the Enrollment System Core (ESC)
 application. This version applies 40 updates to correct design, code and
 security related defects introduced in previous ES releases.
  
 The following changes are associated with ES 4.4.1:
  
 1.  Always override person table preferred site with Z07 HL7 message 
     containing ZEN segment provided preferred site (WI 329438).
  
 2.  Updated ESR code to resolve Fortify Findings with Critical and High
     priorities (WI 329495).
  
 3.  Updated ESR code to resolve ESR Fortify Critical and High priority 
     Findings (WI 334193).
  
     Category of Findings:
     - Log Forging
     - Mass Assignment
     - Null Dereference
     - Portability Flaw
     - Race Condition
     - SQL Injection
     - Struts: Erroneous validate() Method
     - System Information Leak: External
     - Unreleased Resource: Database
     - Resource: Streams
  
 4.  Allow user to continue with registration under AAP screen with 
     imprecise DOB instead of displaying error (WI 362663).
  
 5.  Fix defects in VOA submission provider service in ESR (WI 371172).
     - Update rules when to query VBA and MSDS for online applications 
       submitted via the Health Care Application.
     - Updated rules create work items for eligibility factors identified 
       by the Veteran on the Health Care Application.
     - Allow users to see the online Health Care Application information 
       from the Enrollment screen for the last submitted application.
     - Add parameter to Control Health Care Application processing in ES by
       VistA site.
     - Update code to fix adding the preferred facility correlation for 
       Veterans submitting first time applications or applications to a new
       site.
     - Update ES to send HL7 messages as soon as application is processed 
       instead of waiting for queries to be complete.
     - Remove submission id from confirmation email.
     - Do not process online HCA applications for Veterans with an 
       enrollment status of deceased; create a work item for these
       applications.
     - Treat Health Care Applications for Veterans currently in a
       Cancelled/Declined enrollment status as a new application for a new
       applicant.
     - Wait 72 hours before creating a work item for pending VBA and MSDS 
       query responses.
  
 6.  Deactivate Unnecessary Creations of MSDS (WI 375280).
  
 7.  ES 4.4.1 Add Functionality to View online application data (WI 
     385176).
  
  
 What to Expect:
 ===============
 The ES 4.4.1 implementation is expected to take less than eight hours.  
 During the ES 4.4.1 implementation, HL7 messaging to and from the ES will
 be disabled by the VistA Interface Engine (VIE) team. After the ES 4.4.1
 implementation, there will be no change in VistA.
  
  
 Implementation:
 ===============
 The implementation of ES 4.4.1 requires deployment of Java software to
 dedicated servers at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC). The
 AITC staff will perform the installation with support from the development
 team. Support from the sites is not required. 
  
 The ES application will be unavailable and Veteran enrollment 
 determinations will be delayed until the deployment is complete. Person
 Service Identity Management/Master Veteran Index (PSIM/MVI) and messaging
 to/from the sites will be unavailable during the deployment. An Automated
 Notification Reporting (ANR) will be created to announce the deployment
 that will list all impacted systems and to track the outage.

 CA Service Manager Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ========================================
  
  - SDM # I7276837FY16  Preferred Facility Mismatch
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
 On Z07 messages, ESR defaults the Preferred Facility on new veteran 
 records to the sending facility in the PID segment. Preferred Facility is
 sent in the ZEN segment of the Z07 which is currently ignored on inbound
 message processing in ESR.
  
 Always override person table preferred site with Z07 HL7 message 
 containing ZEN segment provided preferred site:
   - In case of new person record
   - In case of update person record if person table value is different 
     than ZEN segment value
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Updated ESR code to override person's preferred facility from Z07 HL7 
 message containing ZEN segment provided preferred site.
