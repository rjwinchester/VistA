 437483     ES user cannot access VOA Re-Submit function.
 447564     Transmissions to IRS are rejected.
 453590     AcS changes the value of the UNIVERSALID user header.
  
 Problem:
 ----------
 - 437483 - Users were unable to access the VOA Re-Submit functionality in
            ES where there is no Date of Birth on file for the applicant
            in Identity Management (IdM).
 - 447564 - Transmissions to IRS are rejecting in cases where the persons
            first or last name contains punctuation. Such as O'Connor,
            O'Brien, etc.
 Also rejections are occurring due to address line one being more than 30
 characters long after the escape sequence is added for invalid characters.
 - 453590 - AcS is changing the value of the field they currently send in
            the UNIVERSALID header where ESR currently gets the
            authenticated user network ID.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 - 437483 - The ES capability (permission) was not implemented properly.
            Updated ES to use the proper capability.
 - 447564 - Updated the regex to include stripping of punctuation and spaces
            from the name fields. Truncated address lines after escaping
            special characters.
 - 453590 - Updated user header to ADSAMACCOUNTNAME, per direction from AcS
