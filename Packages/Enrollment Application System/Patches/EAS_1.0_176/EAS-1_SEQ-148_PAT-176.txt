 534702      Problem: Pending Application Reports - Pending Applications
             Schedule Report Detailed Format .csv report contains incorrect
             labels.
  
             Resolution: Updated .csv report format.
  
 793956      Problem: Section 508: Information, structure, and 
             relationships conveyed through presentation cannot be read
             (programmatically determined).
  
             Resolution: On the Person Search screen, an accessibility
             property was added to each of the navigation links. When a 
             user does not have permission for a particular link, the
             screen reader will read the link title and then say the link
             is not accessible.
             On the Veterans Demographic screen, the missing title property
             was added to the Addresses sub-tab. Now the screen reader will
             announce: "Address sub tab".
  
 793990      Problem: Section 508: Keyboard-operable user interface 
             elements do not have a visible indication of focus.
  
             Resolution: As recommended by the 508 Office, the navigation
             bar's behavior has been documented in the Accessibility 
             section of the application's Online Help.
  
 793998      Problem: Section 508: The name, role, and value of user 
             interface elements in the product cannot be read.
  
             Resolution: On the Veteran Demographic screen, the missing 
             title property was added to the Address sub-tab. On the
             Veteran Communications screen, a title property was added to
             the column header links and a variable added to the table's
             summary property to identify which column the table is sorted
             by.
  
 797775      Problem: Section 508: The Person Search screen-mouse cursor
             creates an infinite loop.
  
             Resolution: As recommended by the 508 Office, this behavior 
             was noted in the Accessibility section of the application's
             Online Help.
  
 808703      Problem: Application error message displayed after update 
             button is clicked - Add MSE button clicked, no data entered.
  
             Resolution: Added form validation logic.
  
 842345      Problem: ES is sending the incorrect person bio source date.
  
             Resolution: Updated code so that ES sends the most recent 
             entity source date as the person bio source date.
  
 911803      Problem: Permanent Mailing Address with Bad Address Reason is
             not getting persisted in ES as sent from VistA via ORU-Z07
             message.
  
             Resolution: The not statement in the check for "has a matching
             address record" in IsPermAddressHasBadAddressReason was
             accidentally removed while fixing defect 845428 in ES 5.4. 
             This fix reverses the error so that the not statement is now
             included.
  
 927993      Problem: Unexpected sub-bio in VET360 payload causes JSON 
             mapping exception.
  
             Resolution: Added ignore unrecognized property for JSON 
             mapper.
  
 932334      Problem: Real-time Veterans Choice Eligibility (VCE)
             recalculation batch does not process all records in single
             execution.
  
             Resolution: Added idempotent=false setting for RecalculateVCE
             batch process and changed schedule to execute every hour.
  
 933394      Problem: Rurality Changed Batch Process does not process all
             records in one run.
  
             Resolution: Changed incremental processing to a one-time query
             execution.
