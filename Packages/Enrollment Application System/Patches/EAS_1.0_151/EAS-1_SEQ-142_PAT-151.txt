Description:
============

 Patch EAS*1.0*151 is being released to support the enhancements for the
 Enterprise Health Benefits Determination (EHBD) program that focuses on 
 updates for the Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) project, which 
 supports Enrollment System Community Care (ESCC).
  
 EAS*1.0*151 is being released with DG*5.3*941 and IVM*2.0*164 in Host File
 DG_53_P941.KID.
  
 EAS*1.0*151 is also being released in support of the Enrollment System 
 (ES) 5.2 release. Refer to Informational Patch EAS*1.0*159 (Enrollment
 Application System) for additional details regarding the ES release.
  
 Listing of Updates:
 ===================
 This patch makes the following enhancements to the Veterans Health
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Registration, 
 Eligibility, & Enrollment (REE) for the display available from menu 
 option View Patient Address [EAS VIEW PATIENT ADDRESS].
  
 A new address type of Residential Address can be viewed. This address is 
 used by Enrollment and Eligibility to retain the geographic residence of 
 an applicant or patient. It supports the Enrollment System Community Care 
 program's need to determine geographic distance from a treatment facility.
 In addition, the screen labels and prompts are modified as follows.
  
 1. The field label for the patient address is modified from "Patient 
    Address" to "Permanent Mailing Address".
  
 2. The field label for the date of the patient address change is modified 
    from "Patient Add Change Date" to "Permanent Mailing Add Change Date".
  
 3. The field label for the site of the patient address change is modified 
    from "Patient Add Change Site" to "Permanent Mailing Add Change Site".
  
 4. The field label for the source of the patient address change is
    modified from "Patient Add Change Source" to "Permanent Mailing Add
    Change Source".
