Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) 5.6 RELEASE

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The purpose of this informational patch description is to announce the 
 release of the Enrollment System (ES) 5.6. This release, developed in Java
 technology, contains Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 
 development and upgrade efforts, including enhancements to support ES
 Community Care (ESCC) and ES Sustainment.
  
 ES 5.6 was successfully deployed on Saturday, May 4, 2019.
  
 The following functionality is updated in this ES 5.6 release:
  
 ESM
 1. ES is enhanced to interface with the VET360 address validation service 
    and display the results provided by the service to the ES user who can
    select the most accurate address.
 2. ES is enhanced to implement the Preferred Name field.
 3. ES is enhanced to allow editing of the Appointment Request field after 
    a Veteran's application has been completed in the Add a Person module.
    Once the Appointment Request field is updated, ES will notify VistA of
    the change.
 4. ES is enhanced to limit the future discharge date (FDD) for a Veteran's
    application to 365 days from the current date.
 5. ES is enhanced to set applications to a "Not Applicable" enrollment 
    status when an FDD is received from the Healthcare Application (HCA)
    system.
 6. ES is enhanced to share the site identifier with VET360 as part of each
    address, phone, and email update message. ES is also updated to
    handle logical deletes of phone numbers and email addresses from 
    VET360. 
  
 Enrollment System Community Care (ESCC)
 ES is updated and enhanced to implement business rule and system process 
 changes associated with the MISSION Act. President Trump signed the 
 MISSION Act into law on June 5, 2018. The MISSION Act goes into effect on 
 June 6, 2019. Changes to ES that support the functionality for the 
 Community Care Program (CCP) requirements of the MISSION Act are as 
 follows:
 1. Introduction of new Health Benefit Plans (HBPs) and Veterans Choice
    Eligibility (VCE) codes
 2. Introduction of new combinations of VCE codes and new scenarios that 
    will be supported based on business rules
 3. New iLOG rule flows and extract, transform, load (ETL) jobs based on
    business rules to support this new and revised logic
 4. Changes to the following screens and reports:
    - Health Benefit Plan
    - Community Care (CC) Determination
    - CC Determination History
    - System Parameters
    - Veterans Choice Eligibility (VCE) Parameters
    - Third-Party Administrator (TPA) Details
    - TPA Export Report
    - Community Care Network (CCN) Contractor Message Log
    - CCN Export Report
 5. New data being exchanged with Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) for Title 
    38 Care and Urgent Care
 6. Cleanup of the ES ETL for the existing CDW interface for Wait-Time
 7. Implementation of changes to the business rules and associated data 
    around the Hardship Eligibility and Hardship HBPs
  
 Operational Decision Management (ODM)
 For the iLOG to ODM project, the 71 iLOG rule sets were transferred 
 from iLOG to ODM.  A Mediation Framework was established to allow the ES
 user to switch between the iLOG and ODM rules sets as the rules sets
 are integrated into the ES application. ES 5.6 integrates rule sets that
 support the Person Eligibility and Process Demographics functionalities.
 Screen functionality is unchanged by the upgraded rules.

 RTC #       Problem / Resolution:
 --------    --------------------
 746736      Problem: A StackOverflow exception occurs during Add a Person.
             Resolution: Added bean (domainconcept entry for 
             moneterybenefit) in model_properties.xml.
  
 812027      Problem: Take out the Bad Address Indicator (BAI) when an 
             address is corrected by VET360. 
             Resolution: Added check to ensure that false string is handled
             by the inbound VET360 code.
  
 874714      Problem: CCN Insurances fail to upload in ES if the file 
             contains two entries for the same record.
             Resolution: Corrected the CCN Other Health Insurance (OHI)
             private insurance processor transaction boundaries; 
             restructured the code so that each OHI record has its own
             transaction.
  
 899494      Problem: VET360 client is not retrying HTTP 500 errors.
             Resolution: Updated all handlers to retry the message if it is
             not an expected checked exception.
  
 910333      Problem: Section 508: Medal of Honor (MOH) radio buttons are 
             not keyboard accessible if MOH = NO or No Data.
             Resolution: Modified screen to override the default tab order
             when No Data is selected, so that the focus will go to the NO
             radio button instead.
  
 921339      Problem: Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code 
             is truncated in Geocode_Transmit.
             Resolution: Corrected the ETL query to retrieve all five
             characters.
  
 933988      Problem: Records with address or phone changes that do NOT 
             change VCE are being excluded in the Third-Party Administrator
             (TPA) file.
             Resolution: New ETL job TPA_POSITIVE_PROD created to include
             records with address and phone changes in TPA positive files.
  
 937497      Problem: Deleting phone numbers (Home, Mobile) is not 
             triggering a Z05.
             Resolution: Added code fix to ensure that VET360 outbound
             messages get sent on deletion of addresses, thus triggering a
             Z05.
  
 939276      Problem: MOH can only be added to a person who has Veteran
             Indicator = Yes.
             Resolution: Code has been updated to do the proper validation.
  
 950355      Problem: Error screen appears when filtering on CCN Messages
             Search Screen for more than 1,000 records.
             Resolution: Updated the exception handling for the CCN search 
             to catch MaxRecordExceededExceptions and output an error
             message to the user interface (UI) when they occur.
  
 960040      Problem: ES is not updating the effective date of the 
             residential address correctly when message is received from
             VistA.
             Resolution: Changed the ProcessAddress rule on iLog and ODM by
             removing setAddressUpdatedDate to current date. This ensures 
             that the incoming address will be accepted as is.
  
 960266      Problem: Effective dates on all address types are being 
             processed in RF1 segment with no regard to time zone.
             Resolution: Enabled the zone inclusion in the address builder 
             for the following two address metadata: AddressMetaDataFromZTA
             and AddressMetaDataFromPID.
  
 963997      Problem: TPA files have duplicates.
             Resolution: Modified the flow to check the review flag to 
             ensure that the save isn't happening during a review. The
             review  flag is used to ensure that when the process comes
             from MSDS it will not do the save either. MSDS is configured
             to execute the rule flow multiple times with tempPerson. When
             the return uses tempPerson, the flag set is ignored. It is
             only acted upon when the process is called with the onFile
             session person.TBD.
  
 965309      Problem: Incorrect VCE due to P.O. Box pattern mismatch.
             Resolution: Modified the REGEX that captures P.O. Box and 
             General Delivery.
  
 965311      Problem: Geocode_Transmit Audit trigger is skipping some 
             history.
             Resolution: Implemented changes to audit trigger and records
             restoration database so that history updates will not be 
             skipped by the audit trigger.
  
 968724      Problem: CDW data should be capitalized before updating to
             Administrative Data Repository (ADR).
             Resolution: Capitalized all clinic names in ADR.WaitTime 
             table.
