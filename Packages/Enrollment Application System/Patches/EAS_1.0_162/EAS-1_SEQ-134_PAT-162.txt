 Rational Team Concert (RTC):
  
 RTC #       Problem / Resolution:
 --------    --------------------
  
 717969  Problem:  Phones number and Email updated from VOA where it turned
         the updates phone and email into deletes then adds and sent that 
         to VET360.
         Resolution: Removed the code that is sending deleted records.
 718256  Problem:  User only updates the Bad Address Reason on the 
         permanent address.  The record did not send to VET360.
         Resolution: Fixed sending of record to VET360 on Bad Address
         change; also, updated the Address update date.
 718258  Problem:  VET360 CASS Certified type should not remain Processing 
         status If ES received unexpected error Response from VET360.
         Resolution: The transaction audit ID was checked for null but not
         an empty string which caused a validation exception. To fix this,
         an empty string check is being done. When the following event type
         was received SYN_ACK_PERSON_EXCEPTION_THROWN the exception was not
         getting routed to an update error. This is not modified to be
         mapped using the message event type. The client code is sending
         back the following event type ES_TO_VET360_EXCEPTION_THROWN but it
         isn't being parsed and processed. This can be sent in the event
         the client was unable to send a request to VET360. The reason for
         this could be a validation exception reason, therefore a manual
         parsing was added to retrieve the data from the incoming message
         and set the CASS status to NOT_CHECKED.
 718641  Problem:  ES Site of Change field did not reflect to 200 CORP VBA 
         or Corrected in Exception QUEUE.
         Resolution: Fixed the issue with Site of change not showing the
         Name. Also fixed the "Add New Phone" issue.  In addition, two
         additional issues were also addressed:
         1. If the existing address was from VET360 and the modified
         address came in from a different source, the site_of_change in the
         Address table needs to be deleted.
         2. If the existing address was from a non-VET360 source, the new
         modified address comes in from VET360, the STD-Institution needs
         to be deleted from Address table.
 718965  Problem:  Null Pointer Exception Email Type.
         Resolution: Code added to account for email type being null.
 721269  Problem:  When user just updates on Source of Change or/and Site 
         of Change field, the address is sent to VET360 for validation.
         Resolution: Took out ChangeSource, Change Site and VET360 Change
         Site of the equals method so updates are not sent.
 721390  Problem: VET360-All four phone numbers receive new timestamp, and
         New Value is shown for all four numbers on the History page when
         only some of telephone numbers are updated via HCA.
         Resolution: Added formatting in the incoming VET360 process so the
         phone number is formatted before being saved to the database.
 721633  Problem:  ES transaction staying in received status.
         Resolution: Set the new address.person to null. 
 721692  Problem:  Add A Person from ES Addresses remain in Processing 
         Status.
         Resolution: Added CI compare logic to process AAP and process Z07
         in the Messaging Service for VET360 outbound messages.
 722489  Problem:  Email updates cause Address and Phone updates also.
         Resolution: Added CI compare logic to process AAP and process Z07
         in the Messaging Service for VET360 outbound messages.
 723882  Problem:  User updated email or phone, Addresses CASS Certified 
         Date and CASS Update Date also got updated.
         Resolution: Don't process updates from VET360 more than once, if
         the existing CI_Tx_Log Status is COMPLETE, that TxAuditId change
         has already been processed by ES.
 723989  Problem:  County field did not set to null on the ES UI when 
         update from domestic to international address from VET360.
         Resolution: Modified the county to be set when present if it is
         USA address only. If the county received is null then we will be
         resetting our address county to null since.
 724592  Problem:  Community Care Determination/Time Elig Information - 
         JAWS reader reads 5 columns when 4 columns are displayed.
         Resolution: Remove the extra column in the time eligible
         information table.
 725130  Problem:  508 Residential Address corrected from VET360 Spectrum 
         UI results to ES with a Bad Address Reason "Other".
         Resolution: Bad Address Reason only updated on
         Correspondence/Permanent addresses received from VET360.d Address
         Reason.
