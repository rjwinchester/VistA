Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) 4.2 RELEASE

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Public Law 112-154, requires Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide hospital
 care and medical services to Veterans who served on active duty at Camp
 Lejeune (North Carolina) for one or more of 15 specified illnesses or
 conditions (Esophageal cancer; Lung cancer; Breast cancer; Bladder cancer;
 Kidney cancer; Leukemia; Multiple myeloma; Myelodysplastic syndromes;
 Renal toxicity; Hepatic steatosis; Female infertility; Miscarriage;
 Scleroderma; Neurobehavioral effects; or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). To be 
 eligible for care under the provisions of this bill, the Veteran must 
 have served on active duty at Camp Lejeune for not fewer than thirty (30) 
 nonconsecutive days between August 1, 1953 and December 31, 1987.
  
 The purpose of this Informational patch is to announce the release of the
 Enrollment System (ES) 4.2 software which specifically focuses on the
 Camp Lejeune-Veterans (CL-V) project. These enhancements will provide the 
 ability to manage, communicate, share, and process Veterans with the Camp 
 Lejeune indicator through the Enrollment System (ES). New functionality 
 allows determination of a Veteran's eligibility or lack of eligibility 
 for the CL-V benefit. If determined eligible, the Veteran is automatically
 promoted to Priority Group (PG) 6, unless a higher priority group is
 warranted based on other eligibility factors. Six user screens have been
 enhanced with CL-V information. An ES user can view, enter, or update the
 Camp Lejeune Eligibility indicator and associated Camp Lejeune eligibility
 information through the following screens:
  
    -  Edit Current Eligibility - Other Eligibility Factors - edit CL data
    -  Current Eligibility - Other Eligibility Factors panel - view
       CL eligibility
    -  Eligibility Change History - Other Eligibility Factors - view 
       history of changes to CL Data
    -  Current Military Service - edit CL data
    -  Military Service Change History - view history of changes to CL data
    -  Add a Person - enter Camp Lejeune Eligibility indicator in the 
       Current Military Service and Edit Current Eligibility screens
  
 Software enhancements were added for receiving regular data feeds from 
 the Camp Lejeune Environmental Action Report (CLEAR) database and updates 
 to the ES records with the incoming data stream. Additionally,
 modifications to existing interfaces were made in order to share the Camp 
 Lejeune eligibility between the ES, VistA REE, other VistA applications, 
 and repositories, and to satisfy reporting needs.
  
 This ES 4.2 application is developed in Java/.Net technology. Upon ES 4.2
 release, CL will be fully functional in ES and CL data will only be
 available within ES.  This functionality includes the CLEAR importing of
 CL eligibility, processing of the CL indicator when submitted from the
 Veteran's On-Line Application (VOA), and the sharing of CL data via
 Eligibility & Enrollment (E&E) Web Service. Associated Veterans Health
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) patches will be
 released following the ES 4.2 deployment. During IOC testing and national
 release compliance period, ES will only share CL data with the IOC test
 sites. This will be controlled via a system parameter within ES. Once all
 sites have installed the host file and the CLV rollout parameter has been
 set to communicate to all sites, Camp Lejeune eligibility and associated
 data collected in ES 4.2 will be shared at the site level.  This includes
 Camp Lejeune data received from VOA and the CLEAR batch import process.
  
  
 Enhancements:
 =============
 An ES User can update the Camp Lejeune Eligibility indicator and associated
 Camp Lejeune information through the following screens:
         Current Military Service screen
         Edit Current Eligibility screen
  
 The following fields have been added to the screens:
  
   Camp Lejeune Eligibility
   Verified Methods

 to assist in completing Camp Lejeune information as needed. 
  
 The Online Help page for Enrollment help text will also be updated to reflect
 the automatic Priority Group 6 or higher placement for Camp Lejeune verified
 enrollments.  
  
 The Enrollment System will send the following information to all sites of
 record (via a Health Level 7 (HL7) Z11 message):
   Camp Lejeune Eligibility Indicator
   Camp Lejeune Eligibility Date Time Change
   Camp Lejeune Eligibility Change Site
   Camp Lejeune Eligibility Source of Change
  
 The Enrollment System will be able to receive the following information from a

 What to Expect:
 ===============
 During the ES 4.2 implementation, which is expected to take less than 
 eight hours, HL7 messaging to and from the ES will be disabled by the 
 Vitria Interface Engine (VIE) team. After the ES implementation, there 
 will be no immediate change in VistA REE. CL eligibility will be added at 
 a later time with the VistA host file DG_5_3_P909.KID containing 
 Registration patch DG*5.3*909 and Income Verification Match patch 
 IVM*2.0*161.
  
 Implementation:
 ===============
 The implementation of ES 4.2 requires deployment of Java software to dedicated
 servers at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC). The AITC staff
 will perform the installation with support from the development team.
 Support from the sites is not required. 
  
 The ES application will be unavailable and Veteran enrollment 
 determinations will be delayed until the deployment is complete. Person
 Service Identity Management/Master Veteran Index (PSIM/MVI) and messaging
 to/from the sites will be unavailable during the deployment. An Automated
 Notification Reporting (ANR) will be created to announce the deployment
 which will list all impacted systems and to track the outage.
