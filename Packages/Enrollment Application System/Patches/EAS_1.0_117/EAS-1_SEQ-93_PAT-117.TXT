Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) APPLICATION, VERSION 3.12.5

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The ES application version 3.12.5 addresses one defect related to sending
 Delete for empty value on appointment request indicator and appointment
 request date values in ZIO segment; and one requirement change to allow update
 of such values from Z07 when either value is currently Null. 
  
 Enhancements:
 =============
 Send empty values as Null on ZIO segment if they currently are Null and
 Veteran is in Verified enrollment status Allow update from ZIO segment on Z07
 if either appointment request indicator or appointment request date is
 currently Null.
  
 What to Expect:
 ===============
 No changes to any VistA packages are required. ES will halt sending delete
 indicator on ZIO segment in all cases where Veteran is not in Cancel/Decline
 or Rejected status. 
  
 Implementation:
 ===============
 ESR 3.12.5 is a centrally managed web-based application and will be
 implemented as a one-time rollout by the ES Technical team. No software will
 be installed at the facilities.
  
  
 Implementation Date:
 ====================
 July 26, 2014
  
 Associated Remedy Tickets:
 ==========================
 #1006932
 Problem:
 ========
 The APPOINTMENT REQUEST DATE field (#1010.1511) is missing for some patients
 that have APPOINTMENT REQUEST ON 1010EZ field (#1010.159) indicator set to a
 value of YES.  Auditing has indicated the EAS ESR xxx ORU-Z11 CLIENT protocol
 appears to be deleting the appointment request date from certain records. 
 The ORU-Z11 protocol is an IVM package HL7 protocol that provides the means
 by which the VistA facilities process an Unsolicited Enrollment / Eligibility
 transmission from the Health Eligibility Center's Enrollment System. These
 deletions have the potential of a negative downstream impact to the New
 Enrollee Appointment Request (NEAR) management and reporting options.
 
 Solution:
 =========
 These issues were discussed on the bi-weekly EHBD Remedy Ticket Discussion on
 Thursday. July 10, 2014.  These calls allow high priority items and that need
 attention to be brought to the larger EHBD IPT, which is held on Mondays on a
 Bi-Weekly basis.  Enrollment System development staff has indicated analysis
 and correction is completed on both issues; with sending the delete quotes
 and the failure to populate subsequent updates. The EHBD IPT voted to release
 a fast-track patch in order to correct the problems.
