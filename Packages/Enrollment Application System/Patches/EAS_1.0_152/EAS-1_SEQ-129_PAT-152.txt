Subject: ALLOW ORU-Z10 TRANSACTION TO PROCESS FOR SAME INCOME YEAR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch, EAS*1.0*152, will enable the ORU~Z10 HL7 message to process
 when the previous means test on file was a converted means test and the
 means test on the ORU~Z10 message is for an income year after the
 converted means test.

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 I9941275FY16 - Means Test/Copay Test not transmitting.
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The Income Match Verification System does not updating the patient income 
 data when an unsolicited ORU-Z10 record is transmitted. This record is 
 transmitted when the Veteran's income status is updated at another VAMC.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Updated routine MT^EASCM to look for current income year and allow process
 to proceed if it is not the same year as the last means test. Previously
 this would simply quit processing.
  
  
 Technical Section:
 ==================
 Routine MT^EASCM has been modified to set the IVMLAST variable to a null 
 string if the income year is not the same. This will prevent rejection
 later when the dates are checked.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ==============================
  1.  The IVM BACKGROUND JOB [IVM BACKGROUND JOB] should be unscheduled.

      when scheduling to run again after patch install.
   
  2.  The HL7 incoming/outgoing filers should be stopped. Use the  
      Monitor, Start, Stop Filers [HL FILER MONITOR] option on the Filer
      and Link Management Options [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu on the
