 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC0000000315498  LTC Copay test no longer calculated yearly total
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When financial information is entered for a patient on the Current 
 Calendar Year Gross Income Screen <5>, the annual amount does not 
 automatically calculate from the monthly amount when an asterisk is
 appended to the value of the ALL OTHER INCOME (#.17) field in
 the INDIVIDUAL ANNUAL INCOME (#408.21) file, as the help text indicates it
 should.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The input transform will be modified to provide the functionality of
 multiplying a monthly amount into an annual amount when a "*" is added. The
 executable help will also be updated to reflect this functionality.
