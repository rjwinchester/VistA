 --------    ---------------------
 549296      Problem: Health Benefit Plan Assigned - Unselect to Delete is 
             not working properly.
  
             Resolution: When the incoming list of Health Benefit Plans is
             empty, the list of Health Benefit Plans that's already on the
             file object is cleared before merging both lists together.
  
 594410      Problem: Facility pick-list on User Accounts page displays 
             sites inconsistently.
  
             Resolution: Updated sort order for facilities.
  
 653932      Problem: ES View Unformatted Health Level 7 (HL7) Messages - 
             MSH segment is not displayed flush to the left hand side of
             the screen.
  
             Resolution: Reformatted HL7 message view.
  
 775711      Problem: LabelTag.java is generating incorrect html. 
  
             Resolution: Modified method doEndTag so the end tags match up
             with the start tags.
  
 787075      Problem: associationform.jsp hides some field labels when a
             validation error occurs. 
  
             Resolution: Added corrective code after "chosenElem =
             elem.firstChild.childNodes[0];".
  
 817804      Problem: Address with missing city causes user interface (UI)
             to error out.
  
             Resolution: Added a null check in the city field.
  
 850020      Problem: Health Benefit Plan did not show up on ESCC detail
             report if Veterans Choice Eligibility (VCE) changed to
             Ineligible. 
  
             Resolution: Modified the report query to include the record's
             modified timestamp greater than or equal to record modified 
             date for VCE.
  
 856832      Problem: The method postDataRetrieval() in
             ESCCP2ReportDataDAOImpl.java mishandles confidential 
             information, which can compromise user privacy.
  
             Resolution: Commented out the debug lines to the logger. They 
             are not necessary and expose risk according to the Fortify
             scan.
  
 856867      Problem: The method prettyPrintXML1() in
             IAMWebServiceDelegateImpl.java can crash the program by
             dereferencing a null pointer on line 906. 
  
             Resolution: Added if block around the close call at line 906 
             to keep this from being attempted if the object is null, which
             could cause a crash per the Fortify scan report.
  
 857884      Problem: Vet360 is adding a word "County" to the county field
             data. 
  
             Resolution: Modified ES to fix the HL7 construct logic to 
             exclude the word "County" when searching/validating the county
             data.
  
 858985      Problem: Annual Internal Revenue Service (IRS) client updates 
             for Affordable Care Act (ACA).
  
             Resolution: IRS updates for 2019 applied to code and 
             libraries.  
  
 869295      Problem: Comparator method fails when called by Operational
             Decision Manager (ODM) rule processing.
  
             Resolution: To prevent the exception, specific handling of the
             null value comparison was added.
