Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) 5.3 RELEASE

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The purpose of this informational patch description is to announce the 
 release of the Enrollment System (ES) 5.3. This release, developed in Java
 technology, contains Enrollment System Modernization Phase 2 (ESM P2) 
 development and upgrade efforts, including enhancements to support 
 Community Care (CC) and ES Sustainment.
  
 The following functionality is updated in this ES 5.3 release:
  
 ESM:
 1. Functionality is added to have a Pre-closure Letter mailed to Veterans
   who were mailed an initial pending letter between March and November
   2016 informing them of their record closure.
 2. The Mail Responses from Initial Mailing and Pre-closure Letter mailing
   is imported to the ES Communications Log.
 3. A batch job is created to set enrollment applications to "Closed 
   Application" status and apply an enrollment end date based on a file 
   provided by the business which contains ICNs and enrollment end dates
   for each application to be closed.
 4. A reusable option is configured to mail a final closure letter on
   demand when their application is closed by the new "Closed Application"
   batch job.
  
  
 ESCC:
 1. The following new functionality is added to set the Effective Dates for
   Veterans Choice Eligibility (VCE) Distance Parameters: 
     - Set the Effective Dates for VCE Wait Time Parameters so that changes
       to these wait time parameters are used to determine VCE for Veterans
       on the intended date and time.
     - Add On-Demand VCE Distance Parameters configuration that
       specifies how far a Veteran's residential address must be from a
       Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act (VACAA) facility to
       be eligible for the Veterans Choice program.
     - Add configuration to exclude VCE Distance and Wait Time
       Parameters, so that each parameter may be excluded in determining
       VCE based on a configurable effective date set.
     - Add configuration to capture VCE Parameters audit history.

 RTC #       Problem / Resolution:
 --------    --------------------
 549184      Problem: The generated error message "Stop Communications has 
             been selected" is not read immediately by screen reader on the
             Stop Communication Letter status page.
             Resolution: Modified the Information and Error Messages HTML
             Code, so that the screen readers detect and read the messages
             when the message box is in focus.
  
 556256      Problem: Station Name from CDW is different than in SDS table.
             Resolution: Code changes were made to add CDW_STATION_NAME
             column to WQAITTIME table.
  
 690211      Problem: Reason For Early Separation is NOT getting updated
             when the 'Narrative Reason For Separation Txt' received from
             eMIS is different from the text displayed in ES. 
             Resolution: Code changes were made to handle the "noncached" 
             lookup for the narrativeReasonType on the lookupDAO table.
  
 724204      Problem: The site of change field displays correctly in main 
             address GUI.  But on the historical page, site of change 
             displays empty.
             Resolution: Code changes were made to ensure that the correct
             site of change value is being used on the Historical Address
             screen.
  
 748790      Problem: Station number in wait time information is displaying
             only a 3-digit number.
             Resolution: Code changes were made to the ETL job to extract
             the station name and number from CDW.
  
 771209      Problem: ORUZ11 message is not getting triggered when there is
             a mismatch in Period of Service vs MSE Service Period.
             Resolution: Code changes were made to attach the person
             object by loading person at the start of the transaction.
  
 771942      Problem: Production defect - PLC extract job is not executing
             as scheduled.
             Resolution: Code changes were made to add the PCL extract job
             to the common.scheduledJobs.triggers file to be executed as
             scheduled.
