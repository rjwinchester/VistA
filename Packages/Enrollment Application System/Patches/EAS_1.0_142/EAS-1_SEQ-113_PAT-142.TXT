Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) APPLICATION, VERSION 4.4

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is obligated to support the Patient
 Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Effective January 1, 2014, the
 Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires minimum essential healthcare coverage by
 every individual taxpayer. Enrollment in Veterans Health care meets the Minimum
 Essential Coverage (MEC) threshold requirements.  For more information
 regarding requirements, refer to 26 Code of Federal Regulations
 (CFR)1.36B-2(c)(2)(ii) of the Treasury Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).
                                                                            
 The VA is required to provide the IRS with a list or file containing
 information on every Veteran and beneficiary that obtained MEC through the VA
 for a tax year. The information provided to the IRS includes: name, address,
 DOB, insurer information (VA information, Part III of the 1095B), and either a
 full year or number of months the VA provided MEC. Section 6055(a) requires
 every entity that provides MEC, to file annual returns reporting information
 for each individual for whom coverage is provided. The Veterans Letter, 1095B
 form, or equivalent communication, must be prepared annually for the prior tax
 year and filed with the IRS.
  
 Enrollment System Date of Death:  MVI will become the VA's one authoritative
 service for managing the Date of Death information.
  
 The purpose of this Informational patch is to announce the release of the
 Enrollment System (ES) 4.4 software which specifically focuses on accomplishing
 requirements of the ACA project. ES 4.4 permits the following functionality:  
     
 -      Enhance the E&E Web Service to provide the MEC start and end dates to 
        an authorized consumer.
 
 -      Enhance the Enrollment System to automate generation of the ACA 1095B
        mail generation files.
 
 -      Enhance the Enrollment System to receive, store and display ACA mail
        communication status and electronic copies of the mailed documents.
 
 -      Enhance the Enrollment System to provide Reports on ACA mail
        communication and IRS transmissions
 
 Enrollment System Date of Death:
 
 -      Modify the Enrollment System to stop sharing Date of Death information
        with VistA sites of record. This does not include sending the
        Enrollment Status of 'DECEASED.
 
 -      Modify the Enrollment System to ignore and not process Date of Death
        information from VistA sites of record by applying the site list that
        Enrollment System should ignore.
 
 -      Modify the Enrollment System to send Date of Death information to MVI
        even when the system parameter for Use MVI Date of Death Service
        Indicator is set to "YES".
  
  
  
  
 
 What to Expect:
 ===============
 The ES 4.4 implementation is expected to take less than eight hours.  During
 the ES 4.4 implementation, HL7 messaging to and from the ES will be disabled by
 the Vitria Interface Engine (VIE) team. After the ES 4.4 implementation, there
 will be no change in VistA. 
  
 Implementation:
 ===============
 The implementation of ES 4.4 requires deployment of Java software to dedicated
 servers at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC). The AITC staff will
 perform the installation with support from the development team. Support from
 the sites is not required. 
  
 The ES application will be unavailable and Veteran enrollment determinations
 will be delayed until the deployment is complete. Person Service Identity
 Management/Master Veteran Index (PSIM/MVI) and messaging to/from the sites will
 be unavailable during the deployment. An Automated Notification Reporting (ANR)
 will be created to announce the deployment that will list all impacted systems
 and to track the outage.
