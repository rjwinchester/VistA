 Associated Clear Quest Requests
 ===============================
 CR 13411
 CR 13412
 
 CR 13411 Problem:
 Some of the fields contained in the 1010EZR form do not reflect the Office
 of Management and Budget (OMB) approved form fields.
                                                           
 Solution:
 Solution is to upload the current fillable PDF to align the 10-10EZR with the
 OMB approved form (July 2013).
 
 CR 13412 Problem:
 The landing page for VOA is defective as it does not contain the link to the
 1010EZ form used by Anonymous/LOA 1 users. 
                                            
 Solution:
 Adding the link to the 1010EZ form will fix the issue, allowing anonymous and
 DS Logon Level 1 users to submit the form. Enables access of the Anonymous and
 DSLogon1users to a landing page containing Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to  
 a blank 10-10EZ  application form.
                                                    
                                     
 What to Expect:
 ===============
 No changes to any VistA packages are required. 
                                             
 
 Implementation:
 ===============
 VOA 4.0.3 is a centrally managed web-based application and will be
 implemented as a one-time rollout by the ES Technical team. No software will
 be installed at the facilities.
