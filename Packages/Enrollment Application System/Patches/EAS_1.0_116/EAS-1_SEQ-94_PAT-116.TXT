Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) 4.0 RELEASE

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The purpose of this Informational patch is to announce the release of the
 Enrollment Systems (ES) 4.0 build and ES 3.12.6 for the Veteran Online
 Health Application (VOA) Graphical User Interface/Front End, referred to
 as VOA UI.
  
 The Enterprise Health Benefits Determination Program (EHBD) provides
 enhancements to the Enrollment Systems. 
  
 This ES 4.0 build, developed in Java/.net technology, will have both
 Enrollment System Enhancement (ESE) and Enrollment Customer Enhancements
 (ECE) development efforts including enhancements to  ES applications and
 functionality such as the Enrollment System Core (ESC), Health Benefits
 Plan (HBP), Veterans On line Application (VOA), Enrollment System
 Enhancements, Veterans Benefits Handbook (VBH), Enrollment System
 Financial (ESF) Letters and Income Verification Match (IVM).
  
 Enhancements:
 =============
  
 Update Manage Batch Handbook Requests
    - How the user requests a batch of handbooks for mailing, views 
 Handbook batch request status information including historical 
 information, or cancels a scheduled batch request has changed.  ES now 
 allows for preferential selection of a priority group when scheduling a 
 batch request.
  
 View Handbook Batch File Statistics
    - Users can now view, for a specific date, statistics related to the 
 weekly generation of handbook and insert requests included in the batch 
 file and sent to the CMS.
  
 Maintain Veteran Email Address
    - Changes were made to the Communications/Delivery Preference and 
 Demographics/Addresses screens with respect to the Veterans email address.
  
 Health Benefits Plan (HPB)
    - Additions and updates were made to some HBP descriptions (viewable 
 in the online help).
  
 Presumptive Health Benefit Plan (HBP)
    - ES now automatically assigns or un-assigns the Presumptive Health 
 Benefit Plan to new Veteran records based on new rules and triggers 
 (update existing Veteran records scheduled for future release).
  
 Reports
    - Reports QM 26 & QM 27 were removed from the Reports screen.
  
 Batch Processes
    - "Batch Process for sending Final Letter requests to CMS" and "Batch 
 Process for handling the CMS Final Letter request results" were added to 
 the Batch Process Management screen.
  
 System Parameters
    - IVM Final Letter Indicator and VOA Anonymous/Level 1 Process 
 Indicator System Parameters were added.  
  
 VOA 
    - Deploying new servers and COTS ADOBE software at AITC to allow
 Veterans to log in through eBenefits to access a 10_10EZ form to fill out
 and submit for VA Health enrollment. This process will replace the
 existing frontend system located in Martinsburg and automate the process.
    - The VOA Web Service was changed to align with the latest version 
 of the 1010EZ form released by OMB, and
    - To return an error message back to the VOA frontend when the 
 functionality to support anonymous and LOA 1 users is turned off.
    -Provide interface to generate the existing online interactive 
 questionnaire for the VA Forms 10-10EZ/EZR.
    -Enable access to Veterans with DS Logon Level 2 by logging into the 
 eBenefits portal.
    -Provide the ability to consume DS Logon Level 2 credentials from 
 eBenefits/VAAFI Proxy.
    -Enable bi-directional connection for data exchange from/to VOAUI and
 ES
    -Provide the ability to pre-populate the forms with the Veteran's 
 existing data from ES.
    -Enable online submission of completed VOAUI to ES.
  
 What to Expect:
 ===============
 During the ES 4.0 implementation, which is expected to take less than 
 eight hours, HL7 messaging to and from the ES will be disabled by the VIE 
 team.
  
 Implementation:
 ===============
 The implementation of ES 4.0 requires deployment of Java and .NET 
 Software to dedicated servers at the AITC.  The AITC staff will perform 
 the installation with support from the development team. Support from the 
 sites is not required. 
  
 The ES application will be unavailable and Veteran enrollment 
 determinations will be delayed until the deployment is complete.  
 PSIM/MVI and messaging to/from the sites will be unavailable during the 
 deployment. An ANR will be created to announce the deployment which will 
 list all impacted systems and to track the outage.
