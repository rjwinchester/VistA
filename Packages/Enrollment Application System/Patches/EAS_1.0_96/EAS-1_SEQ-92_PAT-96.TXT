 be decommissioned shortly after all sites have installed this suite of patches.
 This patch will inactivate the HL7 protocols utilized for messaging with the
 HECL.

 ClearQuest entry: ESR_CodeCR8792 - VistA patch to inactivate HL7 messaging 
 with HEC Legacy.  
  
   
 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
 =====================
 The post-install process of this patch, EAS1096P, disables the appropriate
 protocols to stop communication with HEC Legacy (HECL) when the patch
 is installed.           
  
 Note: the "nnn" equates to the site's Station Number in the protocol
 names below.
  
 PROTOCOL (File #101)
  
 1)  The DISABLE (#2) field of the PROTOCOL (#101) file for the following 
     protocols will be updated with the text "Disable VistA to HEC Messaging".
  
    File# 101 - PROTOCOL
  
         VAMC nnn ORU-Z04 SERVER H   
         VAMC nnn ORU-Z04 SERVER V
         VAMC nnn ORU-Z05 SERVER
         VAMC nnn ORU-Z10 SERVER                                               
         VAMC nnn ORU-Z11 SERVER                                                
         VAMC nnn ORF-Z10 SERVER 
         VAMC nnn ORF-Z11 SERVER
         VAMC nnn QRY-Z07 SERVER
         VAMC nnn MFN-ZEG SERVER  
   
 2) Dual messaging which sends outbound messages to both HEC Legacy and
    the ES system is modified. The following HEC Legacy subscriber
    protocols are removed from the VAMC server protocols:
  
    File# 101 - PROTOCOL
  
         VAMC nnn ORU Z07 CLIENT  removed from VAMC nnn ORU-Z07 SERVER
         VAMC nnn ORU Z09 CLIENT  removed from VAMC nnn ORU-Z09 SERVER
         VAMC nnn ORF Z07 CLIENT  removed from VAMC nnn ORF-Z07 SERVER
  
 3) The RESPONSE PROCESSING ROUTINE (#772) field on the following protocols is
    changed from D ORF^IVMCM to D ORF^EASCM
  
        VAMC nnn QRY-Z10 SERVER
        VAMC nnn QRY-Z11 SERVER 
   
 4) An Error Message will be provided should any of the standard 
    Protocols listed above be missing from the site. All available 
    Protocols will be reset per the information above.
