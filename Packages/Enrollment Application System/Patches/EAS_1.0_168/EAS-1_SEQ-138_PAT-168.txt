 810016      Defect: Production defect: A ORUZ10 transmission failure
             occurs due to the Social Security Number (SSN) data stripped
             from the ZDP segment. Sites are recording 
             <SUBSCRIPT>IX+1^DIE1 errors when attempting to process HL7
             ORUZ10 financial updates sent from ES.
  
             Fix: 
             Code changes to remove the following method and method calls 
             that was removing the SSN from the ZDP segment and setting it
             to an empty string:
             cleanupSensitiveData(message.getSegments()).
