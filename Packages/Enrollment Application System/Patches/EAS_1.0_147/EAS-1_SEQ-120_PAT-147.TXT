 305033          ES Updates to support Self-Identified Gender Identity
 464842          AAP DGEN add alert bulletin going to all sites of record
 466618          Fortify : Resolve ESM Critical Priority Security
                 Vulnerabilities
 466619          Fortify : Resolve ESM High Priority Security Vulnerabilities
 475568          ES sometimes deletes Date of Death from MVI
  
 Problem:
 ----------
 305033 - Update ES to read new SIGI trait from MVI, and allow display and
          edit from ES UI as with other traits.
 464842 - When a user changes a Veteran's Preferred Facility in ES, the DGEN
          mail bulletin that notifies the site the person was added is being
          sent to all sites of record.  That bulletin should go only to the
          Preferred Facility.
 466618 - Fortify security scan revealed Critical severity issues.
 466619 - Fortify security scan revealed High severity issues.
 475568 - ES sometimes deletes Date of Death from MVI.
 496468 - ESM_2.0_ES FDD If the FDD is deleted in ES and there is no MSE or
          other ZMH entry, the HL7 ORU-Z11 does not have a ZMH line which
          does not allow the FDD to be deleted in VistA.
 496612 - Green Check Mark for Active Address is not working properly for the
          address coming from VOA.
 497575 - ESM_2.0_ES FDD ES does not delete the FDD when a Record is returned
          from eMIS with the same Branch of Service and Service Entry Date.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 305033 - Added SIGI to the identity traits object, populate from display
          when present on Primary View. Added SIGI to 1301/1302 add/update
          messages from ES to MVI.
 464842 - Added sendEmailBulletinPrefSiteOnly method to
          CommsEmailBulletinService and updated call on
          HEC_NOTIFY_SITE_PERSON_ADDED in VOAApplicationServiceImpl.
 466618 - Remediated Critical issues and submitted new Fortify scan and code.
 466619 - Remediated High issues and submitted new Fortify scan and code.
 475568 - Added consistency check for ORUZ05 message to check on-file Date of
          Death.
