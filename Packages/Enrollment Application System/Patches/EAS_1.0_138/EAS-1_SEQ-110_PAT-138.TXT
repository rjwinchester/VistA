Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) 4.3 RELEASE

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is obligated to support the Patient
 Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Effective January 1, 2014, the
 Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires every individual taxpayer in the United
 States to maintain minimum essential healthcare coverage or face a tax penalty.
 Enrollment in Veterans health care meets the Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC)
 threshold under 26 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1.36B-2 (c)(2)(ii) of
 the Treasury Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).
                                                                            
 The VA is required to provide the IRS with a list or file containing
 information on every Veteran and beneficiary that obtained MEC through the VA
 for a tax year. The information provided to the IRS includes: name, address,
 DOB, insurer information (VA information, Part III of the 1095B), and either a
 full year or number of months the VA provided MEC. Section 6055(a) requires
 every entity that provides MEC, to file annual returns reporting information
 for each individual for whom coverage is provided. The Veterans Letter, 1095B
 form, or equivalent communication, must be prepared annually for the prior tax
 year and filed with the IRS.
                                                                      
 The purpose of this Informational patch is to announce the release of the
 Enrollment System (ES) 4.3 software which specifically focuses on
 accomplishing the requirements of the ACA project. ES 4.3 permits the
 following functionality:  
 -      Identification of Veterans for whom to issue an annual Minimum
        Essential Coverage (MEC) letter and IRS Form 1095B. (Claims
        Processing and Eligibility (CPE) identifies the beneficiaries.)
 -      Determination of the MEC during the previous calendar year for an
        individual and populate the IRS Form 1095B.
 -      Establishes a secure interface between the Veterans Administration (VA)
        and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to share MEC information, e.g. IRS
        Form 1095B.
 -      Allows for ES to receive and store an acknowledgement from the IRS for
        receipt of IRS Form 1095B.
 -      Allows designated ES users to view, correct, and retransmit MEC
        information to the IRS on behalf of the Veterans.
 -      Allows designated ES users to complete a corrected IRS Form 1095B for
        Veterans and/or beneficiaries, to issue an annual MEC Letter, IRS Form
        1095B, and MEC Report, to share with IRS. (Currently Claims Processing
        and Eligibility (CPE) must correct IRS Form 1095B for the
        beneficiaries.)
  
 Enhancements:
 =============
  
 ACA Increment 4 adds the following capabilities:
 -      Deliver the required ACA correspondence and IRS reporting capabilities
        through an extension of VA enterprise capabilities for Veterans and
        beneficiaries 
 -      Provide the capability to generate and send a file or list of Veterans
        and beneficiaries and their months of VA health benefits MEC coverage
        for a tax year to the IRS
 -      Provide the capability to correct an IRS 1095B form for Veterans and
        beneficiaries and re-submit to the IRS
 
  
 What to Expect:
 ===============
 During the ES 4.3 implementation, which is expected to take less than 
 eight hours, HL7 messaging to and from the ES will be disabled by the 
 Vitria Interface Engine (VIE) team. After the ES implementation, there 
 will be no change in VistA. 
  
 Implementation:
 ===============
 The implementation of ES 4.3 requires deployment of Java software to dedicated
 servers at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC). The AITC staff will
 perform the installation with support from the development team. Support from
 the sites is not required. 
  
 The ES application will be unavailable and Veteran enrollment 
 determinations will be delayed until the deployment is complete. Person
 Service Identity Management/Master Veteran Index (PSIM/MVI) and messaging
 to/from the sites will be unavailable during the deployment. An Automated
 Notification Reporting (ANR) will be created to announce the deployment
 which will list all impacted systems and to track the outage.
