     check will be done to see if the BT Financial Indicator is
     different than the BT Financial Indicator on file.  (e.g. the
     new Financial Indicator is 1 (YES) and the BT Financial Indicator on 
     File is 0 (No),or the new status is 0 (NO) and the BT Financial 
     Indicator on File is 1 (Yes) or a null).
   - If the BT Financial Indicator has changed, a bulletin 
     will be sent to the BT CLAIMS PROCESSING Mail group.
