 Overview of Test Exclusions for Enrollment System Core (ESC):
  
 The VistA patches associated with the ES 4.1 release have been separated 
 from the ES 4.1 release.  As a result, some of the ES functionality will 
 remain dormant/inactive until the VistA patches are released. 
  
  
 Below is a list of the VistA patches associated with ES 4.1. 
 The patches will be released after ES 4.1 is deployed.

 VOA 4.1 release:
  
 To facilitate and expedite the full automation of VA's online application 
 offerings, VOAUI will enable user authentication through integration with 
 eBenefits/AccessVA/VAAFI (VA Authentication Federation Infrastructure)
 proxy and direct online submission to the Enrollment System (ES).
  
 The authenticated VOAUI will use ES services to query and retrieve veteran
 data and prepopulate VOAUI's 10-10EZ/EZR form.  These prepopulated forms
 will be available for the authenticated user to complete and/or update
 relevant information required and will be submitted online to ES.  VOAUI
 is accessible from the eBenefits portal and AccessVA for authorized users
 with DS-Logon Level 2.
  
 This VOAUI 4.1 enhancement release includes the following features:
 -  Integrate VOA with AccessVA's Identity Access Management (IAM)
    Portal Strategy
 -  Align with the latest OMB-approved VA 10-10EZ/EZR forms dated July 2014
 -  Provide document upload capability for the Veteran to attach/include 
    documentation when submitting to ES.
  
  
 What to Expect:
 ===============
 During the ES 4.1 implementation, which is expected to take less than 
 eight hours, HL7 messaging to and from the ES will be disabled by the VIE 
 team.
  
  
 Implementation:
 ===============
 The implementation of ES 4.1 requires deployment of Java and .NET 
 Software to dedicated servers at the Austin Information Technology 
 Center (AITC).  The AITC staff will perform the installation with support
 from the development team. Support from the sites is not required.
  
 The ES application will be unavailable and Veteran enrollment 
 determinations will be delayed until the deployment is complete. 
 PSIM/MVI and messaging to/from the sites will be unavailable during the 
 deployment. An ANR will be created to announce the deployment which will 
 list all impacted systems and to track the outage.
