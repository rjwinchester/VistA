 Problem:
 ----------
 514252 - In CC Viewer for foreign address, it does not display Country,
 Province, and Postal Code. It displays street name and city only.
 515430 - Nearest VACAA Facility section - Result field is not displaying
 status properly when addresses have not been sent to geocoding.
 515537 - On the CC Viewer page, the Special Authority indicator is not
 correct - for example, a Veteran with Agent Orange - Vietnam shows a
 Special Authority indicator of "No" on the CC Viewer page.
 515545 - There are instances where the VISN is not displayed on the CC
 Viewer page for the "Nearest VACAA Facility".
 515681 - TPA batch process email statistics for numberOfSuccessfulRecords
 appears to be inaccurate. numberOfSuccessfulRecords should be the same as
 the numberOfPositiveRecords or numberOfNegativeRecords, depending on which
 file is being produced.
 516086 - Site Granting Hardship: Information is not available.
 521869 - Nearest VACAA Facility Section - The Station Name of Waco, TX is
 mapping to the Philippines.
 521870 - Nearest VACAA Facility Section - The distance is reflecting "0"
 if no data is available.
 524367 - TPA file format is incorrect.
 527067 - If Camp Lejeune data entry has null value, ES is not able to open
 Community Care Determination page.
 532842 - On Community Care Determination page the residential address is
 displaying the state and zip code on a separate line.
 532851 - The results in the Nearest VACAA Facility section on the
 Community Care Determination page display with the acronym VACAA 
 misspelled.
 533518 - ES is allowing users in role of Observer to edit and save
 updates to Veteran records on the military service screen.
 Update and reset buttons should not be visible or active on the
 screen when user is not granted add/edit military service
 information permission.
 533678 - ES GUI is displaying the VISN of the Person and not the
 STATION_VISN.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 514252 - CC Viewer updated to show Country, Province, and Postal Code for
 foreign addresses.
 515430 - The Nearest VACAA Facility section - Result field now displays the
 correct status.
 515537 - All of the Special Authority indicators have been checked to
 determine whether or not a person should have the Special Authority
 indicator set to "Yes" on the CC Viewer page; the verification data has
 been fixed.
 515545 - Fixed the CC Viewer page to display the VISN correctly.
 515681 - Number of Total Records and Number of Positive Records (or 
 Number of Negative Records) is correct for this job which does not 
 process any records, merely places records into a file. Fixed the 
 code to also update Successful Records.
 516086 - Fixed to display the Site Granting Hardship information.
 521869 - PSSG returned the Waco site as the nearest VACAA facility
 for the Philippines address. Not an ES defect. A check has been placed
 on the UI to make sure any such records are not shown so as not to
 confuse the end users.
 521870 - Nearest VACAA Facility Section fixed so that if no data is 
 available it reflects "N/A".
 524367 - TPA formats have been verified.
 527067 - Check added to allow ES to open the Community Care
 Determination page if there is a null value in Camp Lejeune data entry.
 532842 - Community Care Determination page updated so city, state,
 and zip code display on same line.
 532851 - Spelling of VACAA has been corrected on the Community Care
 Determination page Nearest VACAA Facility section.
 533518 - Removed the variable from the reused permission check in
 militaryServiceSiteRecord. The permission value was defaulted to as
 always allowed, without any check for it.
 533678 - Fixed the CC Determination page to display the VISN correctly.
