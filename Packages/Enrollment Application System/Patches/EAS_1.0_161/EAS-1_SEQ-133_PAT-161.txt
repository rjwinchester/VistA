 Ticket #         Overview
 -------------    -------------------
  
 R16901844FY18  Problem: Temporary address at site when removed is still
                         active at other facilities
                Resolution: Made code changes to the 'processaddress' rule,
                         to update Change Effective Date if the Temporary
                         Address is inactivated by the site.
  
 Rational Team Concert (RTC):
  
 RTC #       Problem / Resolution:
 --------    --------------------
 661639  Problem: ES is not setting the Change Effective Date properly if 
         the Temporary Address is inactivated by the site.
         Resolution: Made code changes to the 'processaddress' rule, to
         update Change Effective Date if the Temporary Address is
         inactivated by the site.
  
 701641  Problem: Preferred Facility and Date of Death batch jobs do not 
         save updates.        
         Resolution: Updated transaction properties and changed the save
         function to the "genericDAO" operations in the batch job. Updated
         the Preferred Facility job to also save the separate entry in the
         person table so that the most recent facility box is checked on
         the Facility tab.
  
 708647  Problem: ES displays incorrect error message "Future Discharge 
         Date cannot be more than 730 days in the future".
         Resolution: Updated the "MilitaryServiceMessages.properties" file
         to display the following error, "Future Discharge Date cannot be
         more than 2 years in the future".
  
 710351  Problem: Deleting line 2 and/or line 3 of Residential Address 
         does not trigger ORUZ05.        
         Resolution: Modified the contact information rule flow and the
         trigger of the eCIS/VET360 CASS certification to always send out
         Z05 when processing.
  
 712051  Problem: eCIS did not respond and the Z05 message was not 
         triggered after the "Add a Person" (AAP) with 3 Lines is populated
         for the Permanent Address.
         Resolution: Made code changes to check for a null address before
         the merge is executed and to trigger a Z05 message when a response
         from eCIS is received.
