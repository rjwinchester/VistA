             tables on Financial page.
             Resolution: Data tables are now identified correctly as the

             appropriate tables.
 
 690824      Defect: Source Of Change - VA and VOA do not map correctly so
             'null' needs to be the source in RF1 segment.
             Resolution: From the Source of Change drop down, the VA and VOA
             options are now mapped so that the 'VA' option is mapped to
             VET360 and 'VOA' is mapped to USVOA.
 
 726078      Defect: Section 508 - Focus Indicator skips over the Financial
             Detail link on the Financial screen.
             Resolution: The code now includes an indicator tag so the
             Financial screen, Financial Detail link is now recognized.
 
 726080      Defect: Section 508 - Expand Group eeSummary and Select eeSummary
             clickable images but focus indicator changes when option is
             selected.
             Resolution: The user can now navigate through all active controls
             and select/deselect options while the reader remains focused
             rather than move to the top of the page.
 
 726081      Defect: Section 508 - Expand Group eeSummary and Select eeSummary
             focus indicator focuses on an image that has no functionality.
             Resolution: The user can navigate through all active controls by
             using the keyboard and the system maintains focus after an option
             is selected.
 
 728329      Defect: Spring configuration for "'ecisOutboundJMSTemplate'" is
             causing error messages showing in log files.
             Resolution: An error message was corrected by the changes made by
             RTC task #625544 (ES 5.0 release); additional verification will
             validate that messages are appearing in the log file.
 
 733031      Defect: Remediate High/Critical Fortify findings.
             Resolution: When conducting a Fortify SCA security analysis
             on Pluto Dev stream source code, all ES Critical/High/Medium
             findings were updated/addressed.
 
 739466      Defect: Duplicate inserts into ADR.PERSON_TRAITS.
             Resolution: When multiple transactions are processed at the same
             time, duplicate inserts no longer occur.
 
 741302      Defect: ES sending updates to VET360 when address is not changed.
             Resolution: ES no longer erroneously sends an address change to
             VET360; ES now compares the address fields' effective date before
             updating.
 
 741342      Defect: ES Sending phone related data with no source.
             Resolution: Production data had duplicate phone number types but
             no change effective date; therefore, because production data
             cannot be deleted, the phone compare algorithm was changed to
             look at all phones of each type not just the first type. 
 
 756010      Defect:  INC0810022-Sites reported a 4+ hour query response time
             and experiencing slow acknowledgements.  
             Resolution: Updated the EJB configuration for both the inbound
             query and acknowledgements to improve the processing time.
