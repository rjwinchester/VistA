             capability authorization check.

             Samoa, Mariana Islands, and Virgin Islands with P.O. Box and 
             General Delivery for a Residential Address; Added Northern 
             Mariana Islands to JavaScript to validate states.

             eMIS" when executing Test Execution Record "ESM_2.0_Verify MSDS

             Resolution: "Send Query to eMIS Broker" changed to "SEND QUERY TO 
             eMIS SERVICE".
 
 461266      Problem: There is a defect in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
             Transmission Query Logic.
 
             Resolution: Updated the selection query to use a subquery for the 
             current tax year in the bind variable. Added row number limit and 
             updated scheduler to run every day on smaller chunks instead of 
             one time per year on the whole population.
 
 464513      Problem: Incorrect tab order on Demographics/Identity Traits tab.
 
             Resolution: Removed invalid property ("tabindex...") from 
             stateSelection select element.
 
 474345      Problem: There is an error in the audit identification (ID) for 
             person table stub record creation.
 
             Resolution: Overrode the audit ID in the stub record flow to 
             StubRecordProcess instead of the default audit ID of the user in 
             session. Updated the stub record insert method in 
             PersonServiceImpl to set the security audit ID during the insert, 
             then set it back to logged in user before returning.
 
 474348      Problem: There is a performance defect with code for batch job
             GenerateACAMailExtract.
 
             Resolution: Updated the interface to support the unique ID/Public 
             Key (PK) in the mail files. Added spawned thread tasks to the 
             mail generation process to speed it up. Added custom execution to 
             override the thread pool size.
 
 474355      Problem: There are software ID validation failures for tax year 
             2015 IRS corrections.
 
             Resolution: Created separate client Java ARchive (jar) for 
             previous tax year schemas and used jarjar to version the package 
             names as IRS uses identical package names and classes across 
             different versions that cause classloader conflicts. Created a 
             versioned IRS payload handler to deal with the separate versions 
             and separate software IDs for each tax year. Added checks for the 
             tax year to invoke the specific payload handler for that year. 
             Added read_me file in the client jar library directory with 
             instructions for versioning the client for next year's updates.
 
 482695      Problem: Reports Filtered report results do not show 
             reports for current day.
 
             Resolution: Updated all reports to include ToDate in Report 
             Filter; updated end date with the timestamp from 00:00:00 to 
             23:59:59.
 
 493555      Problem: On the Demographics/Addresses/Add Edit Address page - 
             Screen reader does not read the error message.
 
             Resolution: Adjusted handler in onLoadInit function to set focus 
             to the Message/Error contentAreaLink if the link is loaded to the 
             page.
 
 493605      Problem: On the Demographics/Addresses/Add Edit Address page - 
             Source of Change label is not properly read by screen reader in 
             the Phone Numbers or Email Address sections.
 
             Resolution: Updated Source of Change and Site of Change rows for 
             both Email and Phone Number fields.
 
 493613      Problem: On the Demographics/Addresses/Add Edit Address page - 
             "label for" is missing for Add/Edit Address combination box.
 
             Resolution: Added label to "Add/Edit Address" text.
 
 493935      Problem: In the FDD Detailed Report, the Sort By field 
             name displays incorrectly.
 
             Resolution: Updated JasperReport file to display last name as 
             Last Name.

             required fields are not being marked correctly with the asterisk 
             symbol.
 
             Resolution: Blue asterisk issue has been fixed. The validation 
             for service component has been removed since service component is 
             not required in Add a Person.
 
 494789      Problem: Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) User Agreement Checkbox
             is not enforced.
 
             Resolution: Added code validation on logonAction that prevents
             users from logging in to the system without accepting the
             agreement checkbox first.

             from eMIS with the same Branch of Service and Service 
             Entry Date.
 
             Resolution: Matched Military Service Episode (MSE) to FDD upon 
             receipt from the broker of new MSEs. Removed FDD from the FDD 
             table (and automatically moved to history). The 7/90 day clock 
             will continue to run until its next trigger. Upon the next 
             trigger of the 7/90 clock, the clock processing will detect the 
             matching MSE and close the clock process.
 
 497994      Problem: User Functional Testing (UFT) issues for Online Help
             items.
 
             Resolution: Online Screen Help - Eligibility tab: Misspelled word 
             corrected. Address Accuracy and Veterans Choice List (VCL) 
             matched with User Guide - Phrase "in geocoding table" text 
             corrected. Community Care Determination History text corrected.

             response payload error.
 
             Resolution: Added payload logging to the error handlers in each

             any case where response code is not AA.

             Description.

             Veteran entries.
 
             Resolution: Changed the query to prepare TPA records from ES

             Resolution: Updated iLOG file to display the following missing 
             information: "Previous enrollment status is not equal to

             takes priority over Hardship.

             be used to process eCIS seeding results.
 
             Resolution: Updated ECIS seeding to use address ID field instead
             of address type field.
 
 572590      Problem: Manual Override drop down "Enrollment Systems Record
             Error" needs to be changed to "Enrollment System Record Error".
