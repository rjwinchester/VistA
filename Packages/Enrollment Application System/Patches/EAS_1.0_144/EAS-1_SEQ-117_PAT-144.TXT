 The Geographic-Based Means Test thresholds for Calendar Year 2017 are
 distributed with this patch. The updated values for the GMT THRESHOLDS
 file (#712.5) are used in the determination of a veteran's GMT Threshold
 for a given income year, based on locality and number of dependents.
   
 Geographical income level thresholds are set yearly by the U.S. Department
 of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This large set of income
 thresholds is usually referred to as the HUD index. The geographic based
 income limits for Income Year (IY) 2016 can be found January 1, 2017 at:
 http://www.domain.ext/healthbenefits/cost/income_thresholds.asp
  
 This patch, EAS*1.0*144, is one of three VistA 2017 threshold patches.  It
 addresses the annual updates for the GMT Thresholds. Patch DG*5.3*930 will
 update the thresholds for the Means Tests and the Maximum Annual Pension
 Rate. Patch IB*2.0*583 will address the annual updates for the Pharmacy
 Copay Thresholds.
