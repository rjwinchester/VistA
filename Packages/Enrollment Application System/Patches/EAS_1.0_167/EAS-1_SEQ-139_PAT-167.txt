 442640  Problem: ES is rejecting the Military Service data from eMIS due 
         to unknown values for the country codes.
  
         Resolution: Code changes were made to add logic to set the country
         to 'ZZ' (Unknown) if an unrecognized country code is received.
  
 752784  Problem: CC Determination Page is blank due to Residential Address
         table structure issues (INC0822948).
  
         Resolution: The table structure was corrected and additional
         'activeagg' data handling was added.
  
 801939  Problem: VET360 status NO_CHANGES_DETECTED leaves the CASS status 
         not updating during the processing of the job.
  
         Resolution: Fixed the 'Acknowledgement Message' to allow the CASS
         status to change to the 'certified' status once the CASS
         processing ends.
