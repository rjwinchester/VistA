Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) APPLICATION, VERSION 4.3.1

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The purpose of this informational patch is to announce the release of the
 Enrollment System (ES) 4.3.1 application version software. 
   
 ES 4.3.1 is a maintenance release of the Enrollment System Core (ESC)
 application. This version applies 27 updates to correct design, code and
 security related defects introduced in previous ES releases.  
   
 The following Rational Team Concert Work Items (RTC WI) are associated with ES
 4.3.1
 =============
 1.     RTC WI 279159.  Updated ES messaging format to send an explicit delete
        for agency code on the ZPD segment of the Z11 message when the field
        has been deleted by ES. 
   
 2.     RTC WI 280813. Addressed defect in ES where Z07 fails to upload if it
        contains a military APO/AE address. ES is updated to bypass US city/
        state validation rules for an APO address.   
   
 3.     RTC WI 288240. Updated ES code to not allow VistA to change on file
        Verified Non Veteran status to Veteran status. 
   
 4.     RTC WI 286492. Updated ES code to not allow user to query MSDS Broker
        if Veteran is in locked state due to no enrollment determination. MSDS
        may only be queried for a record that has an existing registration
        event. 
   
 5.     RTC WI 286516. Addressed defect of ES not populating address to the
        primary view for new registrations from VistA Z07. Updated ES code to
        delay adding ESR 200 Correlation in MVI until we have address
        populated in incoming person from Inbound Z07 message. 
   
 6.     RTC WI 288710. Updated ES validation rules for the Spouse Marriage
        Date to not allow dates that are prior to the veteran or spouse date
        of birth.
   
 7.     RTC WI 277655.Updated VOA processing rules to prevent catastrophic
        edit flag from being set on the primary view due to VOA retrieving
        the 200DOD correlation instead of the primary view. ES is updated to
        use the primary view traits during VOA processing. SDM ticket#
        I7407534FY16. 
   
 8.     RTC WI 292736. Updated ES handbook report processing to prevent
        automatic retrigger of undeliverable handbook mail for records
        that are flagged as returned by USPS. 
   
 9.     RTC WI 293077. Updated ES with a separate user capability for 'Manage
        VOA Applications' that is separately authorized from Add A Person
        (AAP) capability to prevent users having both capabilities when
        assigned only the AAP permission. 
   
 10.    RTC WI 294530. Updated ES rules for sharing ZMH on Z11 regardless of
        MSDS query status to allow sharing of the HEC Military Service Episode
        (MSE) to VistA.       
   
 11.    RTC WI 191335. Updated ES to automatically remove cancel/decline
        remarks if the cancel/decline status is changed from Yes to No. 
   
 12.    RTC WI 294904. Correct application error in ES AAP registration for
        records that are known to MVI but have no 200ESR correlation. ES is
        updated to add the ESR correlation during the AAP process. SDM Ticket

 13.    RTC WI 295264. Updated ES VFA processing rules to correct issues of
        calculating income test under the VFA umbrella. Rules updated as
        required to calculate less than 1 year old as of the VFA start date
        or later than VFA start date. In above both cases Income Test should
        be considered as current if test effective date >= VFA start date
        minus 1 year. Otherwise it will considered as expired. SDM Ticket #
        I5839741FY15/I8090309FY16
   
 14.    RTC WI 294787. Updated ES to correct defect of missing data on
        Medicare part B when user selects to copy Part A to Part B. 
   
 15.    RTC WI 300103. Updated ES code to populate lock status under Merge
        record so that ES won't allow user to edit the primary Veteran
        associated with Merge record while the merge is in progress.
