 Enhancements:

 1.     CCR 12941. Updated encryption algorithm for all service user passwords 
        from Triple DES to WASA recommended AES encryption. Removed encrypted

        entered income tests.

        GMT locations. 
  
 5.     CCR 13156. Corrected defect of Handbook Print Records to CMS are

        handbook records to 150,000 or less for printing. 
  
 6.     CCR 13917. Corrected defect of Address committed with invalid character
        markup. System now will properly escape all special characters for XML

 8.     CCR 13856. Added system parameter to enable/disable transmission of

        during Add a Person (AAP) Registration.  
  
 11.    CCR 13725. Corrected defect of handbook error records being hung up in
        mail status 'Send to CMS'. System will now set Handbook error records
        to status 'Reject at HEC'
  
 12.    CCR 13926. Corrected defect of deprecated site DFN being treated as
        valid site. System will now filter out deprecated site DFNs from the
        active correlations.

 15.    CCR 13724. Corrected defect of Country Code being deleted by Z07.
        System will now default the country code to USA if unavailable, or
        prevent deletion of country code if already on file.
  
 16.    CCR 13960. When the Z07 from VistA has a null value in the preferred
        facility field, automatically populate the Preferred Facility with that
        site's identifier. Currently the facility is left as missing and
        veteran handbook cannot be generated.  
  
 17.    CCR 13829. Corrected defect of manage registry screen throwing an error

 18.    CCR 12942. Updated weblogic configuration to set CookieSecure parameter

        Not Properly Secure Cookies. 
  
 19.    CCR 13036. Corrected defect of Z05 not triggered on registering new Vet
        via AAP when country not entered on AAP search screen. System will now
        use default country and transmit Z05 upon registration completion.

        the resubmission screen after veteran has successful application
        processed.  System will now close all pending orphaned applications
        once successful registration is processed.
