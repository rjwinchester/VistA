============

 *********************************************************************
      This is an INFORMATIONAL patch that includes updates to the
      Enrollment System (ES) 4.1 User Guide, Installation Guide, and
      Release Notes.
  
      These updates reflect the fact that the interface between the 
      Veteran Health Identity Card (VHIC) system and ES is not
      functional. The documents are being updated to reflect that the
      VHIC functionality in ES is dormant in the 4.1 release.
  
      The documents updated:
  
      - User Guide
      - Installation Guide
      - Release Notes

 ================
 1.  INC000001222995 - ES 4.1 Documentation Update
   
   Problem:
   --------
   Some of the ES 4.1 documents do not indicate that the VHIC interface
   functionality in ES 4.1 is dormant.
  
  
   Resolution:
   -----------

   4.1 release:
  
   1.  Updated the User Guide
  
   Page 11:
  
   Changed text color of VHIC functionality to grey, and added a 
   footnote to indicate the VHIC functionality is dormant.
   ------------------
   This functionality is implemented in an inactive state and will be 
   activated when the VHIC service becomes available.  
  
   Page 213:
  
   Changed text color of VHIC functionality to grey, and added a 
   footnote to indicate the VHIC functionality is dormant.

   functional in a future release.
  
   Pages 397 and 398:
  
   Changed text color of VHIC functionality to grey, and added a 
   note to indicate the VHIC functionality is dormant.
   ------------------
   VHIC Status (Inactive - the VHIC APIs which populate these fields 
   will become active in a future release)
  
  
   2.  Updated the Installation Guide (page 9)
  
   Changed text color of VHIC functionality to grey, and added a 
   footnote to indicate the VHIC functionality is dormant.
   ------------------
   This functionality is implemented in an inactive state and will be 
   activated when the VHIC service becomes available.

   footnote to indicate the VHIC functionality is dormant.

   activated when the VHIC service becomes available.
