Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) APPLICATION, VERSION 4.0.2

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The purpose of this informational patch is to announce the release of the
 Enrollment System (ES) 4.0.2 application version software. 
  
 ES 4.0.2 is a maintenance release of the Enrollment System Core (ESC) 
 application. This version applies 19 updates to correct design and code 
 defects introduced in previous ES releases.  
  
 The following defects were corrected:
  
 1.   CCR 12752. Corrected Veteran merge error when on file Military 
 Service Episode (MSE) is null. System will now allow proper merge of a 
 new MSE to the on file person record. 
  
 2.   CCR 12753. Corrected defect of Z05 is not sent when new address 
 is added to Veteran record where no previous address exists. System will 
 now properly trigger Z05 message when an initial address is added to 
 Veteran record from the User Interface (UI).
  
 3.   CCR 12755. Corrected Veteran merge error when on file Employment 
 status is null. System will now allow proper merge of a new Employment 
 status to the on file person record. 
  
 4.   CCR 12137/12837. Corrected issue of users unable to enter Rx Copy 
 or Income test for income years outside the Veteran's Financial 
 Assessment (VFA) umbrella. System will now allow tests to be entered 
 according to defined VFA umbrella rules. 
  
 5.   CCR 12878. Corrected issue of workload cases not created when Z11 
 is not sent due to failed consistency check (CC). System will now create 
 workload case for all instances of failed CC that blocks the outbound 
 message. 
  
 6.   CCR 12950. Corrected 'password required' error on user account 
 search screen. System will now allow subsequent searches for a user id. 
  
 7.   CCR 12968. Corrected issue of phone number not displayed on UI 
 after Add a Person (AAP). System now displays phone number on the 
 overview and demographics screen after AAP action. 
  
 8.   CCR 12710. Added additional logger output to internal classes for 
 use by technical teams during troubleshooting. 
  
 9.   CCR 12723. Corrected Null bread crumb trail on View Health 
 Benefit Plans (HBP) UI screen. System now displays the HBP bread crumb 
 trail in the UI. 
  
 10.  CCR 12827. Corrected performance problem on the retrieve 
 candidates query sent from Income Verification Match (IVM) system. 
 Internal only. 
  
 11.  CCR 12896. Batch job for AAC letter scheduler is updated to 
 auto-execute twice per week. 
  
 12.  CCR 12805. Corrected missing discharge type field in the E&E web 
 service response. System now provides discharge type in the MSE node of 
 the E&E payload. 
  
 13.  CCR 12635. Updated production Virtual Content Generator (VCG) 
 service endpoint to avoid using direct server name. 
  
 14.  CCR 12722. Corrected issue of multiple HBP entries inserted to 
 the history tables during address update. Internal only. 
  
 15.  CCR 12986. Corrected issue of intermittent failures to add 200ESR 
 correlation to MVI during inbound Z07 processing. System will now add 
 correlation for all new records during inbound processing. 
  
 16.  CCR 13004. Corrected error on AAP screen if no country is entered 
 by the user when filling in address and phone details. System will now 
 default the country field during the AAP process. 
  
 17.  CCR 13008. Corrected error on null county if not entered as part 
 of address details. System will now populate county if address is based 
 upon zip code. 
  
 18.  CCR 13013. Corrected issue period of service not being calculated 
 when non-veteran moves to veteran service connected status. System will 
 now automatically recalculate period of service upon service connection 
 status change. 
  
  
 What to Expect:
 --------------
 No changes to any VistA packages are required. During deployment of ES 
 4.0.2 HL7 messaging to and from ES will be disabled. Implementation is 
 expected to take less than 8 hours. 
  
  
 Implementation:
 --------------
 ESR 4.0.2 is a centrally managed web-based application and will be
 implemented as a one-time rollout by the ES Technical team and the AITC. 
 No software will be installed at the facilities. ES application will be 
 unavailable and Veteran enrollment determinations will be delayed until 
 the deployment is complete.  
 Messaging to/from the sites as well as E&E web services will be 
 unavailable during the deployment. An ANR will be created to announce the 
 deployment which will list all impacted systems and to track the outage.

 Remedy Tickets & Overview:
 -------------------------
 Problem:
 -------
 1.  #824622  Unable to enter RX Copay Test for IY 2012.
 CCR 12137 created on 3/13/13.  In ESR Production, the user attempted to 
 add 2012 IY RX Copay Test and ESR does not display any functionality to 
 add the information.  The only action button is "Cancel" which appears to 
 be a defect.  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Corrected VFA start date umbrella rule in code file 
 PersonHelperServiceImpl.java 
  
 Problem:
 -------
 2.  #1007040  No enrollment transmissions sent to sites.
 Patient was updated by VBA on 12/20; however, no enrollment transmissions 
 were sent to the sites.  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Corrected workload case creation rule logic in code file 
 UnsolicitedOutboundMessageService.java
  
 Problem:
 -------
 3.  #994331  HINQ response failed to update reduced percentage.
 Incoming HINQ Response failed to update the SC Percentage to reduce it 
 from 100% to 40%.  The HINQ request should have reduced the SC percentage 
 or created a work item of the potential SC reduction for manual 
 intervention.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Corrected workload case creation rule logic in code file 
 UnsolicitedOutboundMessageService.java
  
 Problem:
 -------
 4.  #1021765  200ESR correlation not created.
 Enrollment Systems Redesign - External Interface Issue:  No 200ESR 
 correlation is created in MVI for new Veteran as part of inbound Z07 from 
 VistA. Captured transactions and payloads show ESR is not even attempting 
 to generate the 1301. It checks for correlation then just proceeds as if 
 it found it even though it is clearly not present in the MVI response. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Corrected return value logic for has 200ESR() in code file 
 PersonIdentityTraits.java
  
 Problem:
 -------
 5.  #1035614 Period of service does not automatically calculate.
 Period of service does not automatically recalculate when Veterans Status 
 changes from Non Veteran (Ineligible to Eligible) creating an 
 inconsistency that prevents transmission of Veteran status to VistA.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Updated ILOG rules contents.xmi and ProcessVBAFromMVR.irl files to always 
 enforce rule to recalculate period of service upon status update.
