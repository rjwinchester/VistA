Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) 5.7 RELEASE

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The purpose of this informational patch description is to announce the 
 release of the Enrollment System (ES) 5.7. This release, developed in Java
 technology, contains Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 
 development and upgrade efforts, including enhancements to support ES
 Community Care (ESCC) and ES Sustainment.
  
 ES 5.7 was successfully deployed on Saturday, August 17, 2019.
  
 The following functionality is updated in this ES 5.7 release:
  
 ESM
 1. ES is being modified to support entry and sharing of a single personal 
    email address only.  ES will no longer support entry or sharing of a 
    business email address.  Business email addresses entered prior to the
    ES 5.7 release will continue to be displayed; however, they will be
    greyed out and cannot be updated.   Users will be limited to deleting
    the business email addresses.
  
 Enrollment System Community Care (ESCC)
 1. ES has been modified to include a new "View Geocode Transmit History"
    hyperlink on the "Community Care Determination" page. Once selected, 
    the user is navigated to a new "Geocode Transmit History" page. The
    "Geocode Transmit History" screen data is populated with all the
    historical data from Planning Systems Support Group (PSSG). If there is
    no Geocode Transmit History data present for the Veteran, a green
    banner is presented at the top of the "Community Care Determination"
    screen stating, "No Geocode Transmit History Data available for this
    Veteran" and the "View Geocode Transmit History" hyperlink is disabled.
    The "Geocode Transmit History" page allows users to export the Geocode
    Transmit History data in .csv file format. Once exported, users can
    load the export file in Excel or any application that can read .csv
    file formatted files.
  
 2. The success message that ES displays when a user clicks the "Send to
    Contractors" button to share Veteran data with Third Party 
    Administrator (TPA) and Community Care Network (CCN) contractors now
    reads as, "Person data marked to send to TPA and CCN Contractors." This
    is a confirmation message to the ES user stating that the demographic
    data has been sent to the TPA and CCN Contractors. ES is modified so
    that it will generate an email to the VA OCC CORs whenever an Other
    Health Insurance (OHI) file is received from a CCN Contractor. When OHI
    is received and processed from a CCN contractor, the notification email
    will go to the respective region. For example, Region 1 COR Team will
    only get notifications for Region 1.
  
 3. Staff members that are on the email distribution list (Mail Groups) can
    view the summary level of OHI information sent to ES and they can 
    verify that the email notification was sent when OHI was received from
    any of the CCN contractors. "CCN OHI Report" is added in the Subject
    line of the email. The body of the email will include the following
    embedded content: CCN Contractor Name; File Name; # of Records Sent by
    CCN Contractor; # of Records Received by ES; # of records Processed by
    ES; and the # of Records Rejected by ES due to Validation Errors. ES
    will generate a single notification per OHI file received.
  
 4. ESCC enhancements and modifications also include the following:
    a. Support MISSION Act defects in production
    b. Support CCN testing
    c. Support CCN defects from testing
    d. Development environment code clean up
    e. Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) logging and reporting
  
 Operational Decision Management (ODM)
 1. Under ODM, the 71 iLOG rule sets were transferred from iLOG to ODM. A 
    Mediation Framework was established to allow the System Administrators 
    to switch between the iLOG and ODM rules sets as the rules sets are
    integrated into the ES application. Once the migration is fully 
    completed to ODM, the rules will not be switched back to iLOG unless
    there is a systemic issue with ODM. ES 5.7 integrates the rule sets
    that support the Person Eligibility, Enrollment, Financial, and
    Military Service functionalities.
  
 2. Updates also include rule retirement for the following:
    a. Integrate Beneficiary Travel Rules
    b. Integrate Calculate Financial Decisions Rules
    c. PatientVistSummary
    d. ProcessPersonSignature
    e. NonVeteran

 RTC #       Problem / Resolution:
 --------    --------------------
  
 681161      Problem: A Section 508 defect was reported where the Jaws 
             Reader Voice tool was not always reading out errors to the
             user for some required fields if the required field was not
             being completed correctly in Add a Person.
             Resolution: Changed code so that each required field has an
             ActionMessage that will individually mark the respective field
             with error and the Jaws Reader Voice tool reads out the error 
             to the end user for all required fields marked with an error
             if they are not completed correctly.
  
 716753      Problem: INC0207738 - A defect was reported where ES users 
             were unable to enter a new Copay Test as part of a Veteran's
             Financial Assessment.
             Resolution: Updated back-end code to apply Veteran Financial
             Assessment (VFA) rules to Means Test only. ES users are now 
             able to enter a new Copay Test as part of the Veteran's
             Financial Assessment.
  
 951065      Problem: A Section 508 defect was reported for users requiring
             assistive technologies where required fields were not always
             displaying an error condition to the user if the required 
             field was not being completed correctly on the
             "Demographics/Identity Traits" pages.
             Resolution: Added an else-block to check if the Date of Birth 
             is left null. The code was modified to mark individual fields
             with error on the "Demographics/Identity Traits" pages. Also,
             the Jaws Reader Voice tool reads out the error to the end
             user.
  
 951071      Problem: A Section 508 defect was reported for users requiring
             assistive technologies where required fields were not always
             displaying an error condition to the user if the required 
             field was not being completed correctly on the
             "Demographics/Personal" pages.
             Resolution: Added code to put focus on error message banner 
             when applicable. Modified code to get required fields to be
             individually marked when there is an error on the
             "Demographics/Personal" pages, and the Jaws Reader Voice tool
             reads out the error to the end use.
  
 951076      Problem: A Section 508 defect was reported for users requiring
             assistive technologies where required fields were not always
             displaying an error condition to the user if the required 
             field was not being completed correctly on the "Search Items
             Tab - Create Date Range To:" page
             Resolution: The property for this field is improperly 
             labeled. It was changed to "createDateTo", this way it matches
             the Action Form and generate the error. Also, the Jaws Reader
             Voice tool reads out the error to the end user.
  
 963122      Problem: A defect was reported where the HBP names for 
             Wait-time and Mileage or Hardship and Wait-Time was being
             truncated in the Detail Report when multiple HBP entries were
             being added.
             Resolution: Updated the height of the HBP field in the report 
             to accommodate multiple HBP entries and updated the names of
             the Health Benefit Plans in the code. The HBP for post MISSON
             Act now displays one HBP for the corresponding Veterans Choice
             Eligibility (VCE).
  
 984135      Problem: A defect was reported where the "Send to Contractors"
             button was not being displayed on the Community Care
             Determination screen if the Community Care Eligibility is
             Ineligible (X).  The expected functionality is that when the
             enroll status is Deceased, Not Eligible, or 
             Cancelled/Declined, the VCE Community Care Eligibility is
             Ineligible (X) and the send to Contractor button should be
             available in the Community Care Determination Page.
             Resolution: This issue is now resolved and when the Community
             Care eligibility code is Ineligible (X) in the Community Care
             Determination screen, the "Send to Contractor" button is
             displayed.
  
 984183      Problem: A defect was reported where the CCN Contractor 
             Message Search page is not displaying the correct result for
             Selected CCN Contractor Search field.
             Resolution: This issue was resolved by including the 
             Contractor field as a search filter.
  
 985996      Problem: A defect was reported regarding the errant creation 
             of the ORU Z05 message when users selected the Add
             email>>>Update option. This defect affected newly created
             records or records that already had an email associated with
             the record.
             Resolution: This issue is now resolved and the ORU Z05 
             message is no longer created in these scenarios.
  
 986816      Problem: A defect was reported regarding the 
             cancelled/declined enrollment workflows due to the
             implementation of the VA MISSION Act (MA). For affected
             Veterans, their eligibility for Community Care was not being
             calculated correctly. For a record that was Enrolled, then
             Cancelled/Declined, and then set back to Enrolled, it should
             be treated as a new application for CC determination.
             Resolution: Initial Grandfather (G) eligible record must also
             have Enrollment Date After MA Enactment Date. Enrolled persons
             recalculation for CHOICE requires Enrollment Date After MA
             Enactment Date in addition to requirement of "was ever G". The
             Enrollment Date is After MA Enactment Date only if the 
             Enrollment Date is not null and is after June 5, 2018. A null
             Enrollment Date is considered before MA Enactment Date.
  
 986817      Problem: A defect was reported where the VCE code and
             descriptions were being displayed in the Community Care
             Determination Manual Override New Outcomes field.
             Resolution: Removed VCE codes from CCD Manual Override New
             Outcome labels and only the VCE description is now displayed 
             in the Override New Outcomes field.
  
 986896      Problem: A defect was reported where the Temporary Mailing
             Address displays in the Third-Party Administrator (TPA) and 
             CCN log but not in the Export spreadsheet.
             Resolution: Updated header column to correctly display the
             Permanent/Temporary Mailing Address in the Export spreadsheet.
  
 987253      Problem: A defect was reported where the CCN and TPA export 
             files were not displaying the column headers/labels correctly
             in the Export file. The Enrollment Effective Date, Province
             Foreign Address, and Postal Code for Foreign Address labels
             were incorrect.
             Resolution: Updated the column labels with the correct values
             "Enrollment Effective Date", "Province Foreign Address", and
             "Postal Code for Foreign Address"; in addition, the record 
             with the greatest number of VCEs is now being used to generate
             the column headers for the Export file. This change was made
             for both the CCN and the TPA files.
  
 988514      Problem: A defect was reported in the TPA Message Log Export
             spreadsheet where Social Security Numbers (SSN)s that started
             with a zero were not being displayed correctly.
             Resolution: This issue was resolved and only the last four 
             digits of the SSN are displayed in the TPA Message Log Export
             spreadsheet.
  
 988523      Problem: A defect was reported in the CCN Contractor Message 
             Log screen where the "RETURN TO COMMUNITY CARE DETERMINATION"
             hyperlink was missing.
             Resolution: The CCN Contract Message Log has been updated to 
             show the RETURN TO COMMUNITY CARE DETERMINATION link next to
             the Export button.
  
 994063      Problem: A defect was reported when an email and/or phone 
             number is deleted in VistA, ES was not deleting the email
             and/or phone number for the record in Vet360.
             Resolution: This issue has been resolved. When an email and/or
             phone number is deleted in VistA, ES now send the deletion
             message to Vet360 so the Vet360 record will reflect the
             deletion(s).
  
 997063      Problem: A defect was reported where the confidential address 
             was being shared with the CCN.
             Resolution: Confidential address is no longer shared with CCN.
             Only the Residential Address, Permanent Mailing Address or
             Temporary Mailing Address is shared with CCN.
  
 998576      Problem: A defect was reported in the Appointment Request 
             screen when the Appointment Request value was changed from a
             Yes to a No, the Appointment Request Date was being populated
             with the system date that the Appointment Request was changed
             to No instead of showing a blank date field.
             Resolution: When an Appointment Request is changed from Yes to
             No, the Appointment Request Date now displays as blank.
  
 998758      Problem: A defect was reported where the New Hardship
             Determination was not being displayed in red text in the
             Community Care (CC) Determination History page when the
             clinically indicated date was removed
             Resolution: When the clinically indicated date is now removed,
             the CC Determination History page displays the New Hardship
             Determination in red text.
  
 999788      Problem: A defect was reported where the Purple Heart status 
             was not updating correctly in ES. When a Purple Heart is
             initially marked as rejected, but then later updated to
             accepted, ES was not accepting the change and left the Purple
             Heart status as rejected.
             Resolution: Removed Purple Heart rules from ODM parameter and 
             the status can now be updated correctly.
  
 1001388     Problem: A defect was reported where VET360 was not sending 
             the personal email to the CCN contractors via the VET360
             interface.
             Resolution: Fixed code in
             VET360InboundProcessService.updateEmails; email was not added 
             to the incoming person. When the incoming person was sent via
             the VET360 interface, since the email was missing in the
             person object it couldn't process it.
  
 1001810     Problem: A defect was reported where ES was throwing an
             application error when users tried to perform a Person 
             Un-Merge.
             Resolution: Changed the obtain call to use IdMWebservice call 
             and user can now perform the Person Un-Merge in ES.
  
 1005908     Problem: A defect was reported for incoming changes from 
             VET360 for addresses, phones and emails which updates the
             address, email or phone database tables. The geocoding
             required flag was not being set for any change in address, for
             this reason not deliverable addresses and address updates were
             not being geocoded.
             Resolution: The geocoding required flag is set for any change 
             in address, resulting on address updates now populating with
             the geocoding. Incoming VET360 updated addresses are now
             geocoded.
  
 1007551     Problem: A defect was reported with the address validation 
             tool where city names that are greater than 15 characters
             would throw the "City cannot be greater than 13 characters"
             error message and prevent the user from adding/updating the
             address.
             Resolution: When accepting the address returned from the
             validation service, if the city name has more than 15 
             characters, then the short city name is substituted. In
             addition, new validation was added to avoid users saving a
             validated address that includes a city name greater than 15
             characters.
  
 1009725     Problem: A defect was reported when retransmitting CCN 
             records. The retransmittal message was not including the
             Priority Group and Enrollment Date values.
             Resolution: Added code to include Priority Group and 
             Enrollment Date to the CCN Service Log record.
  
 1022891     Problem: A defect was reported where the Means Test status was
             being displayed on the banner for the Financials Overview 
             screen.
             Resolution: The Means Test status is no longer displayed in 
             the Financial Overview Screen banner.
  
 1055069     Problem: A defect was reported where CC Basic plans are
             getting assigned to Non-Veterans with one of the Non-Veteran
             Eligibility Codes Enroll status=NOT APPLICABLE.
             Resolution: Change in iLOG rule for "not applicable enrollment
             status" to flow through DetermineVCE rules.
  
 1057055     Problem: A defect was reported in Production where the TPA
             file is failing to transmit through DAS.
             Resolution: This defect was resolved by adding a configuration
             (directory) parameter for TPA files, adding an error handling
             logic to handle the file not found errors, and adding
             additional debug statements.
  
 1062529     Problem: A defect was reported where the Community Care Manual
             Override option was still available after the Veteran's
             enrollment status was changed to Cancelled/Declined and the 
             VCE was not being recalculated.
             Resolution: Corrected manual override, which was comparing
             incorrect variable. When the enrollment status is changed to
             Cancelled/Declined, the Manual Override button is now removed 
             and the VCE is recalculated correctly.
  
 1063879     Problem: A defect was reported in the Enrollment and 
             Eligibility (E&E) Webservice schema where the data was not
             matching the healthBenefitPlan.planName data.
             Resolution: Corrected schema element for
             healthBenefitPlan.planName. The E&E Webservice schema now 
             matches healthBenefitPlan.planName data.
  
 1065737     Problem: A defect was reported in production where ES 
             inadvertently deleting the Date of Death (DOD) caused by an
             inherent delay from the time DOD is updated in MVI and the
             time ESR gets the notification.
             Resolution: This was fixed by ES syncing the Date of Death 
             upon the retrieval from MVI and prior to sending any 1302
             update.
