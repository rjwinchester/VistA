Subject: ENROLLMENT SYSTEM (ES) 5.8 RELEASE

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The purpose of this informational patch description is to announce the 
 release of the Enrollment System (ES) 5.8. This release, developed in Java
 technology, contains Enrollment System Modernization (ESM) Phase 2 
 development and upgrade efforts, including enhancements to support ES
 Sustainment.
  
 ES 5.8 was successfully deployed on Saturday, October 19, 2019.
  
 The following functionality is updated in this ES 5.8 release:
  
 Enrollment System Modernization (ESM)
 1. ES is enhanced to send eligibility, enrollment, and registration 
    changes to VET360 and receive updates through VET360 for changes made
    to beneficiary records in Cerner Millennium.
  
 2. ES is enhanced to display, assign, and share Veteran Medical Benefit 
    Plans (VMBPs). ES will continue sending Veteran Medical Benefit Plan 
    data to VistA sites using the existing framework. Nineteen new Core and
    Supplemental VMBPs are added to ES with an abbreviated name, plan code,
    and description for each plan. 
    a. Core: A record can only have a single core plan and will be
       automatically assigned the best core plan for which the record is
       eligible.
    b. Supplemental: A record can have zero, one, or multiple supplemental
       plans and will be automatically assigned all supplemental plans for
       which the record qualifies.
  
 3. The ES User Interface (UI) has been modified so that all instances of 
    the Health Benefit Plans (HBPs) will now be labeled as Veteran Medical
    Benefit Plans (VMBPs).
  
 4. ES will automatically assign a Veteran Medical Benefit Plan, based on
    eligibility rules, to new and existing records within the system. 
    Veteran Medical Benefit Plans will be assigned to new records upon
    completing the Add a Person (AAP) process. Veteran Medical Benefit
    Plans will be assigned to existing records by an automated batch
    process when ES 5.8 is deployed.
    a. The batch process will begin with the deployment of ES 5.8 and will
       assign new Core and Supplemental VMBPs to existing records at a 
       rate of approximately 5,000 per hour. This will take a period of
       time (Potentially multiple months) to complete.
    b. Note: During this time period, it should not cause concern if a 
       record is located and is not yet assigned a Core VMBP.
  
 5. ES will automatically assign and/or unassign VMBPs based on system 
    updates from the authoritative sources and updates by staff. The
    assigning and unassigning of Core Veteran Medical Benefit Plans will
    not impact the assigning and/or unassigning of Community Care plans.
  
 6. The Veteran Medical Benefit Plan on file for each record will be 
    included as an available field within the E&E webservice. Object names
    within the E&E service requests will remain "healthBenefitPlans".
  
 7. ES calculates the RX copay exemption status result, based on the 
    income information entered by a HEC user, to determine if the Veteran
    has a prescription copay, and uses the result in determining the
    Veteran Medical Benefit Plan and to assign and  unassign Veteran
    Medical Benefit Plans based on eligibility rules.
  
 Operational Decision Management (ODM) 
 Under ODM, the 71 iLOG rule sets were transferred from iLOG to ODM. A
 Mediation Framework was established to allow the System Administrators to
 switch between the iLOG and ODM rules sets as the rules sets are
 integrated into the ES application. Once the migration is fully completed
 to ODM, the rules will not be switched back to iLOG unless there is a
 systemic issue with ODM. ES 5.8 integrates the rule sets that support the
 Process Health Benefit Profile functionalities.

 RTC #       Problem / Resolution:
 --------    --------------------
  
 521867      Problem: Army Post Office/Fleet Post Office (APO/FPO) 
             addresses cause ORU Z05 messages to fail in VistA. If an
             address does not have a county code, VistA will send an error
             back to the ES application.
             Resolution: Updated refactoring method to send a county code 
             for APO/FPO/Diplomatic Post Office (DPO) addresses.
  
 525193      Problem: A defect was reported where the Enrollment System
             Redesign (ESR) alters the Mother's Maiden Name (MMN) field in 
             a new registration.
             Resolution: Corrected parsing of the MMN field so the 
             information wouldn't run together.
  
 778045      Problem: While entering confidential address, a defect was
             discovered where the ES won't save or display the confidential
             phone number. The confidential phone number was not being 
             added to the phone list because the confidential phone number
             did not contain a change date.
             Resolution: Added a change date set to the confidential phone
             number of the transmission date when the incoming Z07 message 
             was received.
  
 866364      Problem: Section 508 - Report EE22 table data is not well 
             placed for a screen reader user.
             Resolution: Removed blank table cells and rearranged the 
             table so that the Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN)
             name and Facility name read on the same line.
  
 866376      Problem: Section 508 - Report EED23table data is not well 
             placed for a screen reader user.
             Resolution: Removed blank table cells and rearranged the 
             table so that the VISN name and Facility name read on the same
             line. 
  
 871698      Problem: The rated disability name lookup never returns a 
             value. When the user enters their disability code, the
             description box displays "looking up description..." and never
             goes past this screen. Due to this, the user cannot verify
             that they are entering the correct disability code.
             Resolution: Changed the implementation of the
             handleRDHttpResponse method of the ESR-Script.js to handle the
             encoded data return from the RatedDisabilityLookupAction
             class. 
  
 1085747     Problem: If a Confidential Address comes in on an in incoming
             message with a future Start Date and there is no Confidential
             Address on file, a Null Pointer Exception (NPE) occurs on the
             Process Address Rule.
             Resolution: Added a Null Check to the Rule.
  
  
 1104367     Problem: ManageContactInformation Rule execution is failing 
             for zip code 00662.
             Resolution: The ADR team created a new County_Type  from the
             STD_County table by eliminating duplicate rows. The 
             combination of CountyNumber and State_ID should be unique. The
             Hibernating mapping file is updated to refer to a new view.
  
  
 1111747     Problem: Logs are filling up due to hibernate flush errors.
             Resolution: Removed the Phone object mapping from the CIPhone
             object and mapped phone_id instead.
  
  
 1115687     Problem: Prescriptions were mis-mailed in August 2019 caused 
             by a batch delete on the corporate side where ES mistakenly
             updated the addresses to end-dated values from VET360.
             Resolution: Added check to ignore address updates from VET360
             where effective end date is set in
             VET360InboundProcessService.
