 The Geographic-Based Means Test thresholds for Calendar Year 2017 are
 distributed with this patch. The updated values for the GMT THRESHOLDS
 file (#712.5) are used in the determination of a veteran's GMT Threshold
 for a given income year, based on locality and number of dependents.
   
 Geographical income level thresholds are set yearly by the U.S. Department
 of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This large set of income
 thresholds is usually referred to as the HUD index. The geographic based
 income limits for Income Year (IY) 2016 can be found January 1, 2017 at:
 https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html#2016
  
 This patch addresses the annual updates for the GMT Thresholds. 
 Patch DG*5.3*930 will update the thresholds for the Means Tests and 
 the Maximum Annual Pension Rate. Patch IB*2.0*583 will address the 
 annual updates for the Pharmacy Copay Thresholds.

 SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL:
 ===================
 The software for this patch is not being distributed through the National 
 Patch Module. This patch is being distributed as a host file. The host 
 file will contain the following KIDS build:
   
              Host file name:    EAS_1_P146.KID
   
                       Build:    EAS*1.0*146
   
 Sites may retrieve the software directly using Secure File Transfer
 Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following OI
 Field Offices:
   
                      Albany   : domain.ext
                      Hines    : domain.ext
                Salt Lake City : domain.ext
        First Available Server : download.vista.domain.ext
   
 The following file will be available:
      File Name            Description
      ---------            -----------
      EAS_1_P146.KID       Host File containing KIDS software distribution
   
  Note:  Use ASCII mode when transferring the .KID file.
   
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This host file can be installed with users on the system.  The installation 
 should not be queued to run.  Installation will take approximately 20 minutes.
 The updates to the GMT THRESHOLDS file (#712.5) are extensive. Due to the 
 volume of updates, the installation process will appear to stall and/or stop.
 This is normal, as the file updates may take up to 20 minutes to complete.
  
        *****Please be patient and allow the process to complete.*****
  
 Also, when comparing the transport global to the current system, entries 
 will scroll by on the screen.  This is normal as there are approximately
 52,120 entries included in the GMT THRESHOLDS file (#712.5) distributed
 with this patch and a comparison is done on each of these entries. It is
 possible your session may time out before the compare has completed. If
 so, you may not be able to get a complete screen capture of the compare.
 This will not, however, mean that there is any problem with the software.
 To avoid a session time-out, you can designate a printer (non-queued) as
 the device for the compare.
