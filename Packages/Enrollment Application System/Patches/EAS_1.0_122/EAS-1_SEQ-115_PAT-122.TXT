 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) I6275652FY16 - While working on an issue with LTC Billing Clock an 
                   error occurred 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    While using the LTC Billing Clock Maintenance [IBAEC LTC CLOCK EDIT] 
    option a user entered "?" at the "Select PATIENT NAME:" prompt and
    received an undefined error.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine EASECU2 to allow users to perform a search 
    using a single "?" or a double "??" as FileMan allows and not receive
    an undefined error. Per current SAC Requirements, we have also updated
    the routine in regards to DILOCKTM.

 Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
  
   Note: Routine EASECU2 was previously updated by patch EAS*1*5.  This 
   was before patch installs were recorded in the INSTALL (#9.7) file.
