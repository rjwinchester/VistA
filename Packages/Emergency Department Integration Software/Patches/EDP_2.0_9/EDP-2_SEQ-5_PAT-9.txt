 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1.I10851094FY16 - EDIS - Change to correct fields .01 and .02 in File 230
 Subfile 230.04
    Problem:
    --------
    For File 230 Subfile 230.04 the fields .01 and .02 need changes. 
  
    Currently, subfile is listed as such:
  
       TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:
       This multiple serves two purposes: 
  
       1)  If the site has chosen to allow free text diagnoses, the list of
       diagnoses entered is stored here.  In this case there will be no ICD
       9 code.  Clerical staff will enter the diagnosis list into PCE at a 
       later time using information from this list.  
  
       2)  If the site has chosen to use coded diagnoses, this multiple is 
       used to hold the selected diagnoses until a PCE visit is created.  
       In that case, PCE becomes the real holder of the diagnosis list.  
  
       The parameter that controls the behavior of this list is in the 
       TRACKING AREA file (231.9).
  
    The technical description makes reference to ICD9 code which is no
    longer valid.
  
    Currently, .01 is listed as such:
  
       230.04,.01 DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS 0;1 FREE TEXT (Multiply asked)
  
        ....
  
        TECHNICAL DESCR: If the parameters are set so that coded
        diagnoses will be required, the text will
        match the Clinical Lexicon text. Some
        Clinical Lexicon entries map to more than one
        ICD code. $$ICDONE^LEXU is used to determine
        which code to store here. 
  
    The Technical description is too long and refers to $$ICDONE^LEXU which
    is no longer a valid API.
  
    Currently, .02 is listed as such:
  
       230.04,.02 ICD9 CODE 0;2 POINTER TO ICD DIAGNOSIS FILE (#80)
  
        ....
  
  
        TECHNICAL DESCR: Clinical Lexicon utilities are used by the
        application to look up diagnoses. Some
        Clinical Lexicon entries map to more than one
        ICD code. $$ICDONE^LEXU is used to determine
        which code to store here. This also becomes
        the code that is stored in PCE. 
  
  
    Again this technical description is too long and should remove the API 
    reference but also the field name of ICD9 Code should be ICD CODE.
  
    This was discussed by the MED 59 team and the consensus recommendation 
    was to have this repaired by the EAM team in the course of some of 
    their other patchwork. 
      
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the 230.04 subfile to:
  
       TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:
       This multiple serves two purposes: 
  
       1)  If the site has chosen to allow free text diagnoses, the list of
       diagnoses entered is stored here.  In this case there will be no ICD
       code.  Clerical staff will enter the diagnosis list into PCE at a 
       later time using information from this list.  
  
       2)  If the site has chosen to use coded diagnoses, this multiple is 
       used to hold the selected diagnoses until a PCE visit is created.  
       In that case, PCE becomes the real holder of the diagnosis list.  
  
       The parameter that controls the behavior of this list is in the 
       TRACKING AREA file (231.9).
  
    Modify field .01 to:
  
       230.04,.01 DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS 0;1 FREE TEXT (Multiply asked)
  
        ....
  
        TECHNICAL DESCR: If the parameters are set so that coded
        diagnoses will be required, the text will
        match the Clinical Lexicon text. Some
        Clinical Lexicon entries map to more than one
        ICD code. 
  
    and modify field .02 to:
  
       230.04,.02 ICD CODE 0;2 POINTER TO ICD DIAGNOSIS FILE (#80)
  
        ....
  
  
        TECHNICAL DESCR: Clinical Lexicon utilities are used by the
        application to look up diagnoses. Some
        Clinical Lexicon entries map to more than on ICD code.
