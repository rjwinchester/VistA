Description:

 Patch EDP*2.0*7 addresses the following two (2) issues:
  
 1. I10849240FY16 - Users who have never been assigned an EDIS staff role 
    see Assess and Visit buttons in triplicate.
  
 2. I10842158FY16 - The Shift Report is generating incorrect data.

 =============================================
  
 1. I10849240FY16 - Emergency Department Integrated Software - GUI 
                       Issue:
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Users who have been given EDIS access can log in to EDIS without being
    assigned an EDIS staff role through the Assign Staff screen. When these
    users enter into a patient's worksheet they see Assess and Visit 
    buttons in triplicate.
  
    Technical Explanation:
    ----------------------
    EDIS is attempting to give these users access to all worksheets. It
    goes through each role's worksheets and assigns them to the user. Since
    the Assess and the Visit worksheets are assigned to all three roles
    access is given three times and these buttons show up three times each.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine EDPBWS has been modified to check that the Assess and Visit
    worksheets are only given once per user.
  
    Routine:EDPBWS
  
 2. I10842158FY16 - Emergency Department Integrated Software - Reports 
                    Issue:
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Shift Report is generating incorrect data because it is not
    properly counting New Patients. The problem is due to a programming
    error which causes the report to exit the code which calculates data
    related to admissions.
  
    Technical Explanation:
    ----------------------
    Internally, the shift report code gives each shift column a written out
    numeral title (ie "one" instead of "1") however a check point at the
    start of the report only handles number values.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine EDPRPT5 has been modified to correct the check point.

 Backout/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksums match
 the pre-patch checksums from the patch description.
