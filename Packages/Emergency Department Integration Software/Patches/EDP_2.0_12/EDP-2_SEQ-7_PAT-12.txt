 Defect Tracking System Tickets(s) & Overview:
 =============================================
  
 1. I10851184FY16 - Emergency Department Integrated Software - 
                    Other:Frequent Error DIAGPCE + 16 EDPQLE 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    An error in a site's error-trap occurs, when an EDIS user attempts to
    edit and save a patient's record, and that record ultimately contains
    "null" in the CPT procedure narrative field.
  
    Technical Explanation:
    ----------------------
    A patient's record may be edited using PCE and EDIS simultaneously.
    If an encounter is being processed per a patient being maintained
    via EDIS; and EDIS processing is attempting to save that patient's
    data with the CPT procedure narrative equal to "null", the attempt
    to save the record in EDIS will cause a hard-error.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine EDPQLE has been modified to verify EDIS does not attempt to
    save a "null" CPT procedure narrative.
  
    Routine:EDPQLE
  
 2. I10847965FY16 - Duplicate Primary Providers 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Duplicate primary providers are appearing on encounters.
  
    Technical Explanation:
    ----------------------
    On occasion duplicate primary providers were assigned to EDIS
    encounters.  As an example, when EDIS and CPRS are used to record
    encounter data at the same time, both the provider using EDIS and
    the provider using CPRS were stored in PCE as the "PRIMARY
    PROVIDER".
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine EDPLPCE has been modified to verify multiple primary
    providers are not recorded per encounters edited via EDIS.
  
    Routine:EDPLPCE

 Backout/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksums match
 the pre-patch checksums from the patch description.
