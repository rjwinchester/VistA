Description:
============

 IMPLEMENTS ICD 10 REMEDIATION FOR EDIS 2.1.2 ENHANCEMENT WITH MINOR FIXES
  
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the implementation date (currently October 1, 2015) will use the 
 ICD-10 code set. Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes
 increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure
 Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9
 codes to nearly 87,000. Both systems also expand the number of characters
 allotted to seven alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include
 the decimal point, which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM
 code set. There is no decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set.
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research.
  
 The intent of this patch is to:
  
 1. Provide the ability to search on ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. The search
 function is performed on the Emergency Department Integration System using
 Advanced Search Functionality. Diagnosis codes entered for a "Time in"
 date prior to the ICD-10 implementation date will be ICD 9 codes. 
 Diagnosis codes entered on or after the ICD-10 implementation date will be
 ICD-10 codes.  
  
 2. Provide the ability to edit closed view to update the "Time In" and
 change ICD-9 codes to ICD-10 codes or to change ICD-10 codes to ICD-9 
 codes.
  
 3. Add the ICD column header and ICD Type column header to reports. In
 reports that already have the ICD-9 column header, the header will be 
 changed to just ICD. Reports affected by this change are the Activity 
 report, The Delay report, The Exposure Report, The Mental Health Report 
 (formerly known as the Behavioral Health or BVAC report), Admissions 
 Report, Custom Worksheets and Ad Hoc reports.
  
 4. Correct 5 minor defects.
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overviews:
 -----------------------------
 1. CQ EDIS00001187 (Remedy INC000000897239)
    EDIS will now allow a user to remove a patient without selecting a 
    Provider for the following special classes of Disposition:
    - Left without being treated
    - Patient name entered in error
    - Sent to primary care
  
 2. CQ EDIS00001188 (Remedy INC000000897799)
    Nurses and Resident roles now correctly open the Edit Closed worksheet.
  
 3. CQ EDIS00001189 (Remedy INC000000898138)
    Selecting the first bed in the list of the Visit worksheet no longer 
    brings up a 'Missing Bed' popup when clicking on the "Save" button.
  
 4. CQ EDIS00001190
    The Provider report has been removed from EDIS.
  
 5. CQ EDIS00001192
    After a user switches from viewing an Edit Closed worksheet to editing 
    and saving a Visit worksheet, the Visit worksheet no longer blanks out.
