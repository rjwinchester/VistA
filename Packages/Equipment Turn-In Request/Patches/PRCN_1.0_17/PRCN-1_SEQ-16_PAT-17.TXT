Description:

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1. I8461549FY16 Cannot COMPLETE an equipment request
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Analysis found that when a user has a null Engineering Training Vendor
    (or not defined in Vendor file) for a request during edit/approval,
    the user will not see the 'Engineering Review Completed' status set 
    properly.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modify the routine so that it ensures the lookup/edit of the 
    Engineering Training Vendor and returns the FileMan lookup/edit from
    the VENDOR file (#440) to the EQUIPMENT REQUEST file (#413) and
    properly handles a null or miscellaneous vendor entry. This will make 
    sure the subsequent edits (after the vendor lookup/edit) will update
    the selected EQUIPMENT REQUEST in the Equipment Request file (#413),
    and correctly set the status to 'Engineering Review Completed'.
