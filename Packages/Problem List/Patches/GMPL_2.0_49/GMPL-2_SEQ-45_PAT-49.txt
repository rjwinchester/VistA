  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch introduces the problem selection list enhancements that are 
 documented in NSR 20160107: Problem List Diagnosis Menu. In order to 
 document a problem within the Problems tab, users must use the Lexicon 
 search to document the problem which often is time consuming and 
 inefficient for common problems. To alleviate this burden, this request 
 seeks to provide a list of commonly used diagnoses in SNOMED CT for a 
 user and/or clinic. A Clinical Application Coordinator (CAC) will have 
 the capability to assign users and/or clinics to any of the problem 
 selection lists through the associating menu options.
  
 As such, this patch contains updates to the problem selection list menu 
 options to streamline the creation and maintenance of selection lists for 
 efficient patient problem documentation in CPRS. The various options on 
 the following menu tree will be updated and can be accessed from the 
 Create Problem Selection Lists option [GMPL BUILD LIST MENU] of the 
 Problem List Mgt Menu [GMPL MGT MENU]:
  
    1      Build Problem Selection List(s)
    2      Copy Selection List from IB Encounter Form
              **> Out of order:  This option has been disabled due to the 
 Problem List SNOMED CT implementation.
    3      Assign/Remove Problem Selection List
    4      Delete Problem Selection List
    5      Check Problem Selection List Problem Codes
    6      Import Problem Selection List
  
  
 A CAC can perform the various actions on problem selection lists as 
 illustrated above. Option 3: Assign/Remove Problem Selection List allows 
 a user to assign or remove selection lists from certain entities using the
 accustomed General Parameter Tools interface. See the OR*3.0*429 patch 
 description for more information.
  
 Option 4: Delete Problem Selection List allows a user to delete a 
 selection list and its content that is no longer in use. A list can only 
 be deleted if it is not currently assigned to a User, Clinic, Division, or
 System entity. This option also checks for any user list assignments in 
 the NEW PERSON file and removes the deleted list appropriately.
  
 Option 5: Check Problem Selection List Problem Codes scans all the 
 current selection lists in the system for any problems that have inactive 
 SNOMED and/or ICD codes. The following sample report is displayed to the 
 user. It has been updated to display the problems with inactive codes, as 
 well as the corresponding category and list it is under. Problems with 
 inactive SNOMED concept codes will be identified with <INACTIVE SCT 
 CODE>, inactive ICD codes will be identified with <INACTIVE ICD CODE>, 
 and if both SNOMED & ICD codes are inactive: <INACTIVE SCT/ICD CODE>.
  
 Code Set Version Review of Problem Selection Lists                 Page: 1
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The following Problem Selection List(s) contain one or more problems that 
 have inactive SNOMED and/or ICD codes attached to them. Any current users
 or clinics using these Selection Lists, will not be able to add the
 problems with inactive codes, until the list and the inactive codes are
 updated. The list may not be assigned to any additional users or clinics
 until updated.
  
  
  TEST LIST:
    CARDIO:
      Acute Myocardial Infarction (ICD-9-CM 410.9)   <INACTIVE ICD CODE>
      Coronary Artery Disease (ICD-9-CM 414.9)   <INACTIVE ICD CODE>
      Angina Pectoris, Unstable (ICD-9-CM 411.1)   <INACTIVE ICD CODE>
      Chest Pain (ICD-9-CM 786.50)   <INACTIVE ICD CODE>
      Angina Pectoris (ICD-9-CM 413.9)   <INACTIVE ICD CODE>
      Dyspnea (ICD-9-CM 786.09)   <INACTIVE ICD CODE>
    GENERAL:

 This patch also introduces a new import utility (Option 6) that will
 assist in the addition and distribution of National problem selection list
 content. This utility or menu option is locked with the new GMPL IMPRT
 UTIL security key and should only be assigned to CAC users. The utility
 allows CAC's to import external list content to the VistA system using two
 import methods:
  
           HF        CSV host file
           WEB       CSV file from a web site
  
 Both methods require the selection list content to be in a specific 
 spreadsheet format and saved as a comma separated value (.CSV) file. If 
 utilizing the "HF" method, the CSV host file must reside on an accessible 
 host system. If utilizing the "WEB" method, the CSV host file must reside 
 on an accessible website.
  
 This patch will also install the first version of the VA-NATIONAL PROBLEM 
 SELECTION LIST which comprises of the following national selection list 
 categories:
  
         VA-PRIMARY CARE
         VA-CARDIOLOGY
         VA-DENTAL
         VA-DERMATOLOGY
         VA-DIABETES
         VA-EARS NOSE THROAT
         VA-EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT
         VA-ENDO METAB EXCEPT DIABETES
         VA-GASTROENTEROLOGY
         VA-GENERAL SURGERY
         VA-GYNECOLOGY
         VA-HEMATOLOGY
         VA-INFECTIOUS DISEASE
         VA-MENTAL HEALTH
         VA-NEUROLOGY
         VA-NEUROSURGERY
         VA-ONCOLOGY
         VA-OPHTHALMOLOGY
         VA-ORTHOPEDICS
         VA-PAIN
         VA-PLASTIC SURGERY
         VA-POLYTRAUMA
         VA-PULMONARY
         VA-RENAL NEPHROLOGY
         VA-RHEUMATOLOGY
         VA-UROLOGY
  
 Once installed, commonly used diagnoses under these categories will be 
 available for CAC's to copy and utilize when building local problem 
 selection lists for their site users/clinics.
  
 The Copy to New Category [GMPL MENU COPY GROUP] protocol menu action is 
 created for this purpose. This menu action allows CAC's to adopt any 
 national categories for local list category creation and use without 
 modifying the national version/standard.
  
 In order to support all these enhancements, the file structures for the 
 PROBLEM SELECTION LIST file #125 and PROBLEM SELECTION CATEGORY file 
 #125.11 were also redesigned. To enable a tighter coupling between a 
 selection list and its categories, the PROBLEM SELECTION LIST CONTENTS 
 file #125.1 will now be a subfile/multiple of the PROBLEM SELECTION LIST 
 file #125. The same concept applies to the PROBLEM SELECTION CATEGORY 
 CONTENT file #125.12 which will now be a subfile of the PROBLEM SELECTION 
 CATEGORY file #125.11. With this new redesign, the file data is also 
 migrated to their respective file record entries to ensure continued 
 operability.
  
 A new CLASS field is also added to the List (#125) and Category (#125.11) 
 files in order to delineate, control, and manage the editing capabilities 
 of national, local, or VISN level lists and categories. CAC's will not be 
 able to create any "national" lists and categories using the "Build 
 Problem Selection List(s)" menu option.
  
 This patch also scans the PROBLEM SELECTION LIST and PROBLEM SELECTION 
 CATEGORY files for any duplicate names or names in mixed/lower case 
 format. A report of finding will be generated to the installer and OR 
 CACS mail group via MailMan and any mixed/lower case names will
 automatically be converted to upper case.
  
 If a CAC is not in the OR CACS mail group when the patch is installed, 
 please have the installer forward any reports to the local CAC. The CAC
 will have to review any duplicate list and/or category names found and
 edit/delete/reconcile the entries as appropriate.
  
 Sample Duplicate Name Report/Message:
 =====================================
  
 Subj: Duplicate Problem Selection List/Category Name Report  [#203470]

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Duplicate problem selection list/category names are no longer allowed with
 patch GMPL*2.0*49. The following list/category names are duplicates. 
 Please have your CAC review these with the pre-existing file entries and
 rename, delete, or reconcile the duplicate entries as needed.
  
      Duplicate List Names:
  
      ORTHOPEDIC
  
      Duplicate Category Names:
  
      NEUROLOGY

 03/13/17@12:59 18 lines
 From: GMPL*2.0*49 INSTALL  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Mixed/lower case problem selection list/category names are no longer 
 allowed with patch GMPL*2.0*49. This patch scans the Problem Selection
 List and Problem Selection Category files for any names in mixed or lower
 case letters and converts them to upper case.
  
 For those conversions that failed, please have a CAC or somebody with 
 FileMan access manually modify the name to upper case.
  
 The following list names converted successfully:
  
      Test List 1
  
 The following category names converted successfully:
  
      Cardiovascular
  
  
 If there are any pre-existing User/Clinic selection list assignments 
 prior to patch installation, a report will also be generated and sent to
 the installer and OR CACS mail group via Mailman. If there are any 
 users that are assigned to a selection list that no longer exists, 
 they will also be captured in this report. The following is a sample
 report:
  
 Subj: Pre-existing USER/CLINIC Selection List Assignment Report  [#154024]
 08/15/17@09:50  129 lines
 From: GMPL*2.0*49 INSTALL  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 This report was auto generated during installation to identify Problem
 Selection Lists assigned to users and clinics prior to the installation of
 GMPL*2.0*49. After installation all users and clinic assignments will be
 migrated to the new Default Selection List Display parameter setting. If
 users and clinics desire to use the National Problem Selection List as
 their default setting then use the Assign/Remove menu option to reassign
 those users or clinics listed in the report.

 Patch Installation:
 ===================
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 There is a pre and post-installation routine (GMPLY49) included. This 
 routine will be automatically deleted once installation has completed.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 The pre-installation routine will automatically scan and correct 
 any mixed/lower case list/category names found and send a report to 
 the installer and OR CACS mail group via MailMan. Additionally, it will 
 scan for any pre-existing User/Clinic selection list assignments and 
 send a report to the same recipients as just mentioned. Any invalid 
 user selection list assignments within the NEW PERSON file will be removed
 appropriately. It will also remove the pre-existing data dictionaries for
 the PROBLEM SELECTION LIST file (#125) and PROBLEM SELECTION CATEGORY file
 (#125.11).
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 Please refer to the Problem Selection List Enhancements Deployment, 
 Installation, Back-Out, and Rollback Guide for installation instructions.
  
 **NOTE: Users should stay out of the Problem Selection List ListManager 
 Application entirely during the installation of this patch as data from 
 files #125.1 and #125.12 are being migrated to files #125 and #125.11 
 respectively. 
  
 Utilizing this ListMan App during the data migration process could lock 
 up certain records and prevent data from being migrated successfully. If 
 this should occur, a lock error message will be generated to the 
 installer identifying those records during the post-installation.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 The post-install routine will automatically migrate data from files 
 #125.1 and #125.12 to files #125 and #125.11 respectively. It is 
 imperative that users stay out of the Problem Selection List ListMan App 
 until the installer has received messages that the migration has 
 successfully completed.
  
 It will also set the CLASS field for all pre-existing lists and 
 categories to "Local". Additionally it will scan for duplicate 
 list/category names and send a report to the installer and OR CACS 
 mail group via MailMan. A few other post-processing items such as updating
 the display order of several option and protocol menu items are also 
 performed. The GMPL CODE LIST menu option is also marked out of order.
