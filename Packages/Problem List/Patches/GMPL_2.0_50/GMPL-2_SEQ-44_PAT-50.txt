Subject: FIX GMPLSAVE ERROR OUT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address a problem with an improperly altered SNOMED 
 (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine) narrative causing the routine
 GMPLSAVE to error out and fail to save a new diagnosis to the Problem List
 from PCE (Patient Care Encounter) and the PCE data is lost.

 CA Ticket Overview:
 ===================
  
 1. I9913186FY16 <UNDEFIND>NEW+29^GMPLSAVE
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The clinician is entering a patient encounter. The clinician adds a new 
 ICD10 (International Classification of Diseases) diagnosis to the PCE
 form. The clinician will click the check box to add this diagnosis as a
 new problem in the Problem List. The clinician will then add a SNOMED code
 to the new diagnosis. The clinician will save the completed PCE in CPRS 
 (Computerized Patient Record System) GUI (Graphical Uaer Interface).
 If the SNOMED code has a narrative with an embedded set of parentheses the
 routine GMPLUTL will alter the narrative to remove the embedded set of
 parentheses and any text they may contain. This will cause the routine
 GMPLSAVE to error out and not save the new diagnosis to the Problem List.
 PCE will lose this diagnosis data as well. The PCE form data and any
 associated progress note are saved without the diagnosis being saved to
 the Problem List or linked to the encounter.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the routine GMPLUTL to not remove the embedded parentheses and any 
 text they may contain in the SNOMED narrative.
  
  
  
 ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the
       INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
   
    3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter GMPL*2*50)
   
         a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
             transport global.
         b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
             the components of the KIDS build.
         c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when this 
             patch
             is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
             (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
         d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
             message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
             backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
       GMPL*2*50.
  
    5. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//" respond NO.  
   
    6. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
  
 Back-out Procedures
 ===================
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System. 
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 =================================
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 GMPL*2.0*50 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch GMPL*2.0*50 in
 the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;2.0;Problem List;**[Patch List]**;Aug 25, 1994;Build 2

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.
