Subject: PROBLEM LIST MENU OPTION GMPL NTRT F/U RPT ERRORS OUT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issue:
  
 The Problem List Mgt Menu [GMPL MGT MENU]'s report option, Problem List
 NTRT Follow-Up Report [GMPL NTRT F/U RPT], errors out in VISTA.
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. CA-SDM R18820037FY18 - Problem list menu report option errors out in
    VISTA.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a Registered Nurse or a Licensed Practical Nurse (who has the ORELSE 
 key but doesn't have the PROVIDER key) edits an encounter note (either by 
 adding an addendum or by editing the encounter of a completed note), he 
 or she selects an International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
 Related Health Problems, 9th revision (ICD-9) code to update to a 10th
 revision (ICD-10) code. After the ICD-10 code is selected, the nurse is
 prompted for a Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms
 (SNOMED CT) code. After the nurse clicks the OK button, the patient's
 problem list is updated with the new codes. In addition, the Responsible
 Provider for the edited problem is changed from its original value to
 UNSPECIFIED (0) and saved to the updated problem record.
  
 If the updated problem record is flagged as needing a National 
 Terminology Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) follow-up, it will appear in the
 report. When the Problem List NTRT Follow-Up Report [GMPL NTRT F/U RPT] 
 option is run and the Responsible Provider is UNSPECIFIED (0), the report
 errors out and the user is forced out of VISTA.
  
 The Problem List NTRT Follow-up Report [GMPL NTRT F/U RPT] option runs the
 routine GMPLNTRT. The report builds an array of records sorted by
 Division, Responsible Provider and so on. When the Responsible Provider
 is UNSPECIFIED (0), the variable used to build the index is set to null.
 When the routine attempts to add a new record to this index, the variable
 with the null value will cause the routine GMPLNTRT to crash.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A modification was made to routine GMPLNTRT to test the value of the
 variable used in building the array of records. If this variable's value
 is UNSPECIFIED (0), the variable will be set to "n/a" and sorted with the
 records in which the Responsible Provider is not known.
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 VA Illiana HCS (Danville)
 VA Portland HCS
  
 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes 
 to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the 
    Installation Menu.
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select Backup a Transport Global and when
    prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch GMPL*2.0*52. This option
    will create a backup message of any routines exported with this patch.
    It will not backup any other changes such as DDs or templates. If for
    any reason the patch is to be rolled back, this backup will be required
    to restore the patch's routine(s) to the pre-installation version(s).
  
 5. From the Installation Menu you may elect to use the following options. 
    When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch GMPL*2.0*52:
  
     a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
     
     b. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to print only 
        a summary of the patch, to print a summary of the patch and the
        routines in the transport global, or to print only the routines in
        the transport global.
  
     c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed. (It compares all components of this patch's routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
 6. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    choose the patch to install.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//'
    respond 'NO'.

    Protocols? NO//' respond 'NO'. 
  
 9. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0.
  
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ===========================
 If the site needs to roll back the installed patch, it can be done by 
 restoring from a backup copy of the routine. During the patch installation
 the installer has the option of using the Backup a Transport Global option
 in the Installation menu. This creates a backup copy of the routines in
 the patch and sends copies by MailMan to user(s) selected by the patch
 installer. To restore from MailMan:
  
 1. Enter the MailMan Menu [XMUSER]
  
 2. At the Select MailMan Menu Option: prompt type in RML for the
    Read/Manage Messages.
  
 3. At the Read mail in basket: prompt select the basket the routine backup
    Message is stored in.
  
 4. At the Enter message number or command: prompt select the message 
    that has the routines.
  
 5. At the Type <Enter> to continue or '^' to exit: prompt enter '^' to 
    skip to the message action prompt.
  
 6. At the Enter message action (in SELECTED basket): prompt type in X for
    Xtract KIDS.
  
 7. At the Select PackMan function: prompt type in 6 for INSTALL/CHECK
    MESSAGE.
  
 8. The user will be presented with the following warning and a prompt:
  
 Warning:  Installing this message will cause a permanent update of globals
 and routines.
 Do you really want to do this? NO// 
  
 At this prompt type in Y for YES to install the backup copies.
  
 9. The user will be presented with the following message and a prompt:
  
 Routines are the only parts that are backed up.  NO other parts
 are backed up, not even globals.  You may use the 'Summarize Message'
 option of PackMan to see what parts the message contains.
 Those parts that are not routines should be backed up separately
 if they need to be preserved.
  
 Shall I preserve the routines on disk in a separate back-up message? 
 YES// 
  
 Answering yes to this prompt is optional. The site can reinstall the 
 patch.
  
 If the user answers YES to this prompt:
     9.1 At the Subject: prompt type in a descriptive subject.
     9.2 At the Send mail to: prompt select the user to send this message.
     9.3 At the Select basket to send to: prompt select the basket to
         send this message. It will default to the IN basket.
     9.4 At the And Send to: prompt select any additional user to send the
         Message to or hit enter to continue.
  
 A message similar to the following will be presented to the user: 
 Building PackMan backup message with subject backup
