Subject: Erroneous Problem File Cleanup

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch will correct several types of erroneous Problem File entries.
 One of these include entries that contain a SNOMED CT (SCT) concept code
 in the Diagnosis (#.01) field. This is caused by updating problems with
 inactive ICD-9 diagnoses via the Diagnosis tab of the encounter form
 dialog of CPRS v30A. When this occurs the SCT concept code is incorrectly
 stored into the Diagnosis field. As a result, the corresponding details
 display and audit history are also rendered incorrectly. This particular 
 issue will be resolved in CPRS GUI v30B.
  
 This patch will perform a file scan and cleanup of these erroneous 
 entries. Once these tasks have completed and errors have been found, two 
 separate MailMan messages will be generated to the installer with 
 instructions on how to access both the error and cleanup reports.
  
 Sample Error Scan Complete message:

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A scan of your system's Problem file #9000011 has been performed for 
 possible errors. There are 9 record entries that contain a SNOMED CT
 concept code in the Diagnosis field #.01.
  
 To see a report of these records, please access the SNOMED in Diagnosis 
 Field Error Report [GMPL DIAG ERROR REPORT] which is attached to the
 Problem List Mgt Menu [GMPL MGT MENU].
  
 These record entries will initially be corrected with the installation of
 GMPL*2.0*40 or by running the Generate SNOMED in Diagnosis Field 
 Err/Cleanup Rpt [GMPL GENERATE DIAG RPTS] menu option off the Problem List
 Mgt Menu.
  
 Once the cleanup is complete, a separate MailMan message will be sent to 
 the installer containing instructions on how to access the cleanup report.
  
  
 Sample Cleanup Complete message:
  
 Subj: SNOMED Error Cleanup Complete  [#151757] 07/01/15@12:56  7 lines
 From: GMPL*2.0*40 INSTALL  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A cleanup of the Problem file has been performed and 9 record
 entries have been corrected. 
  
 These entries no longer contain a SNOMED CT concept code in the Diagnosis
 field #.01. To see a report of these corrected records, please access the
 SNOMED in Diagnosis Field Cleanup Report [GMPL DIAG CLEANUP REPORT] which
 is attached to the Problem List Mgt Menu [GMPL MGT MENU].
  
  
 If no errors are found by the scan, then the following example message 
 will be generated to the installer:

 Please scroll to the right for more information.
  
 These entries no longer contain a SNOMED CT concept code in the Diagnosis 
 field #.01. The correct primary ICD diagnosis and secondary diagnosis
 code(s) is now stored in the appropriate fields. The corresponding SNOMED
 CT concept and designation codes have also been correctly filed in their
 respective fields. The provider narrative and problem fields were also
 updated accordingly as well.

 Consequently the details display and audit history will be corrected as 
 well and no longer display the erroneous messages respectively: No Code
 Selected and Invalid coding system specified.
  
  
 The other erroneous Problem File entries that will be corrected originate 
 from a Patient Safety issue (PSPO 2868) where it was determined that the 
 SNOMED mapping for the term,"History of polyp of colon" was incorrectly 
 mapped. The SCT code 428283002 was mapped to the incorrect ICD-9 
 diagnosis code V15.89. The description for this V code, "Other specified 
 personal history presenting hazards to health" did not correspond with 
 the above SNOMED description. It was determined that the ICD-9 code of 
 V12.72 (Personal History of Colonic Polyps) was more appropriate for this
 mapping. 
  
 This caused the Colonoscopy reminders to fail to trigger correctly. With 
 the Clinical Reminders ICD-10 project, clinical reminders was updated to 
 allow the use of ICD-10-CM and SNOMED CT codes in taxonomies. After 
 ICD-10-CM and SNOMED CT codes have been added to taxonomy, they will be 
 included in the list of codes to search for during reminder evaluation. 
 For example, in order to search the Problem List for an ICD-9 diagnosis 
 code or a SNOMED CT code, both of the codes have to be in the taxonomy. 
 This enhancement was completed in PXRM*2.0.26 which is part of a 
 multi-package build containing DG*5.3*862, GMPL*2.0*44, and PXRM*2.0*26. 
 This build was released July 24, 2015 so it should be installed at all 
 sites.
  
 CAC's will need to verfiy that the SNOMED CT codes are added to the 
 taxonomies so that the linked colonoscopy reminders are triggering 
 correctly even with an incorrect ICD-9 code or mapping. This was a 
 workaround that could have been utilized.
  
 This patch scans the Problem File for these incorrect mappings and 
 performs any necessary corrections. If any incorrect mappings are found, 
 a mapping report will be generated to the installer via a MailMan message.
  
 Sample Mapping Report:

 Problem file scan runtime: Jan 14, 2016@14:32:58
  
 A scan of your system's Problem file #9000011 has been performed for 
 possible errors. There are 5 record entries that contain an incorrect
 SNOMED CT 428283002 to ICD-9-CM V15.89 code mapping for the term "History
 of polyp of colon". As a result the V15.89 code is incorrectly stored in
 the Diagnosis field #.01.
  
 This report contains a list of these erroneous record entries which will 
 be corrected after the installation of GMPL*2.0*40. Once the cleanup is
 complete, the correct V12.72 code will be stored in the Diagnosis field.
  
 **ATTENTION CACs!!**: Once the cleanup is complete, please also review the
 Colonoscopy clinical reminders for the corresponding patients and verify 
 that the corrections have been updated appropriately for those as well.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 There are no special considerations for pre-installation. However there 
 is a post-installation routine (GMPLY40) included. This routine will be 
 automatically deleted once installation has completed.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 N/A
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch loads several routines and may be installed with users on 
 the system although it is STRONGLY recommended that it be installed during
 non-peak hours to minimize potential disruption to users. This patch
 should take less than 1 minute to install.
  
 **NOTE: Users should stay out of the Problem List Application entirely 
 during the installation of this patch as a file scan and cleanup is 
 potentially performed. Utilizing the Problem List during the file scan & 
 cleanup tasks could lock up certain records and prevent them from being 
 successfully corrected. If this should occur, a MailMan message will be 
 generated to the installer identifying those records.
  
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch 
     #(ex. GMPL*2.0*40):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
     Install? NO//', respond with NO. KIDS will automatically attach the 
     new menu options to the designated menu tree during the installation 
     process. There is no need to rebuild the menu trees upon completion 
     of installation.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//', response with NO.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//', respond with YES. Disable all GMPL* options and 
     protocols. NOTE: GMPL MGT MENU option may not disable due to the 
     build configuration. This is ok as the new menu options should be 
     attached as sub-items during installation.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 The post-install routine will call an API that will queue the file scan 
 and cleanup tasks for the Problem file. It is imperative that users stay 
 out of the Problem List until the installer has received messages that 
 these tasks have completed.
  
  
 Backout Plan:
 -------------
 If for some reason this patch needs to be backed out, the following are 
 the instructions.
  
 1) If a backup of the routines have been created using the "Backup a 
 Transport Global" option in Step 3 of the Patch Installation, then the
 original routines can be restored by installing the Backup Packman
 (MailMan) message.
