Subject: CHANGES TO PROBLEM LIST COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF NSR 20130312

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Computerized Patient Records System CPRS v30.B 
 project and includes enhancements to the Problem List comments/annotation 
 functionality in support of NSR 20130312.
  
 This NSR contains two requests:
  
 1. Removal of the block on one clinician editing or deleting a Problem 
 List comment entered by another. The current situation poses a 
 potential patient safety risk whereby invalid comments remaining on a 
 problem list entry can mislead clinicians by displaying information that 
 is no longer valid. This may include such things as obsolete data, care 
 plans/intentions that are no longer applicable. As a historical note, 
 this block is a VA creation, was not part of the original design, and 
 does not exist in the IHS version.
  
 2. Increasing the length of the comment field from 60 characters 
 to 200. The original length is an artifact of 1980's disk space, and was 
 never intended to remain at that size.
  
 These two minimal modifications would remove two significant barriers to 
 the effective clinical use of the Problem List in general. The issues to 
 be corrected are major contributors to clinicians carrying around their 
 own problem lists in progress notes, a practice which has been widely 
 criticized as a patient safety issue. Both the block and the size limit 
 on Problem List annotations are universally unpopular with clinical users.
  
 This patch also addresses a few other issues:
  
 1. The ability to add duplicate problems when creating/editing a user
 selection list in VistA. This is resolved so that duplicate problems can 
 no longer be added to a selection list category. When attempting to do 
 so, the user will be presented with a warning message and prompt to 
 enter another search term to be added.
  
 2. NTRT requests/bulletins for unmapped problems are generated to the
 Standards and Terminology Systems (STS) team incorrectly. When ICD-10 
 implementation becomes active, there is no longer a need to generate 
 these bulletins as the STS team will no longer be responsible to map
 between SNOMED CT (SCT) and ICD-10 diagnoses. These bulletins will be
 disabled when a user selects a SCT term that is mapped to R69. by 
 default. However these bulletins will continue to be enabled for unmapped 
 problems that contain a SCT and 799.9 pairing.
  
 3. When utilizing the Lexicon search within the following areas of the 
 Problem List Manager interface: addition of a new problem, modification of
 an existing problem, & addition of a problem onto a user selection list; 
 SCT designation ID's are either missing or being returned incorrectly for 
 certain concepts(particularly "Fatigue (SCT 84229001)"). This has been 
 resolved so that the correct designation ID's are being returned for the 
 corresponding concepts.
  
 4. An <UNDEFINED>NEW+28^GMPLSAVE *GMPSYN("S") error would occur when 
 adding a SCT/ICD-10 diagnosis to the Problem List via Encounter form 
 dialog. This error has been corrected.

 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) address as directed by the CPRS
 Implementation team. Installation instructions will be distributed when
 your site begins the implementation process.
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at:

 Patch Installation:
 =================== 
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.30.b Installation Guide" for installation 
 and set-up information. This document is exported as OR_30_350_IG.doc and
 OR_30_350_IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_350.ZIP and will be emailed to 
 the installation point of contacts by the CPRS Implementation team.
  
 Installation of these host files must be coordinated among the personnel 
 affected because these host files will be installed in one installation 
 session.
