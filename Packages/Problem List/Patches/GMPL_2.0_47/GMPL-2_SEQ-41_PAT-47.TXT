Subject: Clinical Reminders Mapping Target index update

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch resolves Remedy ticket #1066799 in which an undefined error 
 was generated during reminder evaluation.The error was occurring because 
 the Mapping Targets node Clinical Reminders Index entry was still present 
 even though the data in Mapping Targets node for the corresponding 
 Problem List entry did not have any data in it. This was occurring 
 because Mapping Targets codes were being stored and deleted with direct 
 sets and kills so the cross-reference on Mapping Targets was not being 
 fired. The solution involves changing the Problem List code to use 
 FileMan to store and delete Mapping Targets codes ensuring the 
 cross-reference is fired.
  
 This patch resolves this issue and rebuilds the Reminders indices to 
 clean up any outstanding Mapping Target cross-references that didn't get
 deleted appropriately.
  
 Additionally, several other defects are resolved as a result of testing 
 the above issue:
  
 1) When editing a SCT problem that is mapped to a single ICD-9 diagnosis 
 code using the Problem List Mgt Menu option in VistA and changing the 
 diagnosis to a SCT term that is mapped to multiple ICD-9 diagnosis codes, 
 it was discovered that the secondary mapped ICD-9 diagnosis code was not 
 being saved appropriately. There was a bug in the code and it was being 
 truncated. This is however functioning correctly in the CPRS GUI.
  
 2) When removing a problem mapped to multiple ICD-9 diagnosis codes and 
 where the PRIORITY field is undefined, the corresponding entries in the
 Clinical Reminders Index are also removed but this was not occurring for
 Mapping Targets. The solution to this was to add a new compound
 cross-reference, ACRMTA, on all the fields that are subscripts in Mapping
 Targets Index entries that are above the Mapping Targets multiple. These
 fields are: Date Last Modified, Status, Priority, and Condition.  Now when
 any of these fields are changed the Mapping Targets entry will be properly
 updated.
  
 3) When utilizing the following menu option #6 in the Problem List Mgt
 Menu, "Replace Removed Problem(s) on Patient's List", the process will 
 hang and be stuck in an infinite loop, causing the user to be stuck in 
 this menu option. This has been addressed so this no longer occurs.
