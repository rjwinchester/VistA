Subject: PROBLEM LIST SUPPORT FOR ICD-10-CM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Computerized Patient Records System CPRSv30.A 
 project. This project will modify CPRS, TIU, GMRC, GMTS, GMPL, PXRM, and 
 OERR to meet the requirements proposed by the Dept. of Health and Human 
 Services to adopt ICD-10 code set standards.
  
 On January 16, 2009, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 
 released a final rule for replacing the 30-year-old ICD-9-CM code set with
 International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) and International Classification of Diseases, 
 Tenth Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) with dates of 
 service, or date of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or after 
 the industry activation date. The classification system consists of more
 than 68,000 codes, compared to approximately 13,000 ICD-9-CM codes. There
 are nearly 87,000 ICD-10-PCS codes, while ICD-9-CM has nearly 3,800
 procedure codes. Both systems also expand the number of characters
 allotted from five and four respectively to seven alpha-numeric
 characters. This value does not include the decimal point, which follows
 the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no decimal point
 in the ICD-10-PCS code set. These code sets have the potential to reveal
 more about quality of care, so that data can be used in a more meaningful
 way to better understand complications, better design clinically robust
 algorithms, and better track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also
 incorporates greater specificity and clinical detail to provide
 information for clinical decision making and outcomes research.
  
 This is the Problem List patch to support the requirements of ICD-10-CM
 implementation. The Problem Search function will continue to originate 
 with the Problem List Subset of SNOMED CT and follow the algorithm 
 introduced by the Problem List Data Standardization effort and CPRS v29.
 Prior to the ICD-10-CM implementation date, the selected
 SNOMED CT code will continue to be resolved to the corresponding
 ICD-9-CM code(s), and all of the Problem List display and print options
 will continue to render the diagnostic codes as ICD-9-CM.
  
 Beginning on the ICD-10-CM implementation date, the selected SNOMED CT 
 code will be resolved to the corresponding ICD-10-CM code(s), and all of 
 the Problem List display and print options will render the diagnostic
 codes as either ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM, depending upon the date when the 
 code for the problem was last edited.
  
 NOTE: Functionality specific to activation of the ICD-10 code set shall 
 not be seen by end users until the code set has been activated.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 -------------------------------------
 1. INC000000935290 - EN+38^GMPLSAVE error.
 2. INC000001007105 - UNDEFINED>EN+38^GMPLSAVE.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 1. The ICD column of the GMPL DATA ENTRY List Manager display is not wide 
 enough and truncates the ICD-10 code at 7 chars.
  
 2. When a problem/diagnosis is added to the Problem List via PCE Vista, a 
 duplicate check is performed on the problem against a patient's existing 
 list of problems. A bug has been discovered with this duplicate check, 
 whereby only the provider narrative on file is converted to all 
 upper-case before comparison and the incoming narrative string on the 
 other side of the equation is not. This results in an unequal string 
 comparison and inaccurate duplicate check. Especially when the incoming 
 narrative string is a mixed case of characters.
  
 3. An "UNDEFINED" error is reported when trying to view the details 
 display of a QUASAR problem entry that contains no data in the MAPPED 
 EXPRESSIONS file.
  
 4. The Encounter form incorrectly identifies problems that have inactive 
 ICD codes (those with a # sign next to them). The code was using the Date 
 of Interest or Date Entered fields, instead of the Encounter date if
 defined.
  
 5. When utilizing PCE's Check Out Interview (IN) option to add ICD-9 
 diagnoses to the Problem List for a pre-ICD10 implementation date
 encounter, an "Invalid ICD Diagnosis" message is displayed.
  
 6. Users were able to add ICD-10 diagnosis codes to an encounter with a 
 visit date prior to ICD-10 implementation.
  
 7. When adding a new problem and performing a Lexicon lookup within the
 Problem List ListManger app,a user cannot select a SNOMED CT diagnosis
 that is mapped to multiple ICD-9 target codes and receives a message that
 the diagnosis has an inactive code. The user is advised to edit before 
 adding. This is a bug where the ICD code validity check is performed 
 incorrectly and does not honor multiple target codes.
 inactive code.
  
 8. When adding a new problem within the Problem List ListManager app, the 
 system is not saving/filing the SNOMED CT code to the Problems file 
 causing only the primary mapped ICD-9 diagnosis code to display after the 
 diagnosis description. This creates a misconception that the problem is 
 a legacy ICD-9 problem when in fact it is a SNOMED CT problem.
  
 9. An <UNDEFINED>ADD1+15^GMPL1 server error is received when adding a new 
 problem via the "Problem List Data Entry" menu option in ListManager.
  
 10. When updating a legacy ICD-9 problem to its SNOMED CT equivalent 
 within the Problem List ListManager, the system correctly updates the 
 SNOMED CT description but not the label and code. The incorrect label of 
 the mapped ICD-10-CM code R69 was displaying instead, when it should be 
 the SNOMED CT label and code. This occurs in an environment where ICD-10 
 is active.
  
 11. A user is unable to inactivate an existing ICD-9 diagnosis code within
 CPRS Problem List when ICD-10 is active. User receives the following 
 error message: "Unable to update record: Invalid ICD Diagnosis (Problem 
 IEN#)"
  
 12. A user is unable to annotate an existing problem with an inactive 
 ICD-9 code without having to update/change the problem to an equivalent 
 SNOMED CT term in CPRS v30.A, whether the date is before/after Oct 1, 
 2014.
  
 13. Several CPRS v30.B test sites were receiving undefined errors 
 (<UNDEFINED> DIAGNOSI+3^GMPLUTL1 *PL("DX_DATE_OF_INTEREST")) while 
 testing the Add to Problem List functionality on the Encounter form 
 dialog. These test sites had the GMPL*2*42 v16 patch installed but not 
 the PX*1*199 yet, which introduces this PL("DX_DATE_OF_INTEREST") array
 element.
  
 14. An issue (CCREG-230) was discovered while testing a CCR requirement 
 (SPEC 10 & 10.1), whereby the tester was required to enter an encounter 
 in PCE with an encounter date prior to ICD-10 activation date and 
 associate a HEPC or HIV ICD-9 code with it. This code was subsequently 
 added to the Problem List. The system date is on or after ICD-10 
 activation date.
  
 However during this process of adding to the Problem List, the ICD-9 
 encounter date did not get honored and appropriately filed as the date of 
 interest in the Problem file. Because of this, the Problem List API 
 utilized/filed the current date (ICD-10 activation date) instead as the 
 date of interest which is incorrect. Thereby causing the code set 
 versioning to work incorrectly.
  
 15. When GMPL*2*42 v16 was installed into production at a few sites, it 
 generated a slew of reminder evaluation (MailMan) error messages. This 
 was caused by not shutting down the reminder evaluation during the 
 re-indexing process of the post-install.
  
 16. When selecting a SNOMED CT term mapped to multiple ICD-9 target codes 
 from the Lexicon Search results and clicking to Add to the Problem list 
 from the Encounter form dialog, only the primary ICD-9 diagnosis code is 
 saved to the Problem file. The secondary ICD-9 diagnosis code(s) are not 
 being filed to the Problem file.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 1. The width of the ICD column for the GMPL DATA ENTRY list template has
 been modified to 8 chars to accommodate for a full ICD-10 code display.
  
 2. The incoming narrative string will be converted to all upper-case 
 before making a similar comparison with the narrative on file. This will 
 result in an apples to apples comparison and accurate duplicate check.
  
 3. The array that contains the multiple ICD target code data will always 
 be set to NULL if there is no data in the MAPPED EXPRESSIONS file. This 
 will resolve the "UNDEFINED" error for this array value.
  
 4. The code has been modified to utilize the Encounter date if defined to 
 correctly identify inactive problems on the Encounter form.
  
 5. The Problem List API has been modified to utilize the patient's 
 encounter date (if defined) to check for code validity instead of today's 
 date.
  
 6. CPRS will display a message to the user that ICD-10 diagnosis codes 
 cannot be added to an ICD-9 encounter and prohibit from doing so.
  
 7. Validity check has been modified to now honor multiple mapped ICD
 target codes and performs the check correctly. Users can now add SNOMED 
 CT diagnoses that are mapped to multiple ICD-9 target codes without 
 receiving the erroneous inactive message.
  
 8. The SNOMED CT codes will now be saved and filed to the Problems file. 
 The correct coding system (SNOMED CT) will now be appended to the
 description and displayed appropriately when adding problems via the 
 Problem List ListManager.
  
 9. Modified the GMPL1 routine so that the undefined variable is no longer 
 undefined.
  
 10. Modified the GMPLEDT4 routine so that the correct coding system label
 and code (SNOMED CT) will now display when editing a problem in the
 ListManager.
  
 11. Modified the CPRS GUI v30.A and GMPLUTL & GMPLUTL1 routines so that a 
 user will now be able to inactivate an existing ICD-9 problem within CPRS 
 when ICD-10 is active. The ICD validation API in DIAGNOSI^GMPLUTL1, was 
 utilizing a post-ICD10 date of interest to evaluate against an ICD9 code, 
 which generated an Invalid ICD Diagnosis error message when trying to 
 inactivate. This has been resolved to pass in the correct ICD coding 
 system instead of using the coding type DIAG input parameter.
  
 12. Modified the CPRS GUI v30.A and GMPL,GMPL1, & GMPLEDT1 routines so 
 that a user will now be able to annotate an existing problem with 
 inactive ICD-9 codes without having to update/change the problem to a SCT 
 equivalent term.
  
 13. Modified the code to resolve the undefined error and accomodate the
 scenario whereby the GMPL*2*42 patch is installed without the PX*1*199
 patch. This scenario would never occur when this patch is nationally 
 released, as the GMPL*2*42 patch will require PX*1*199.
  
 14. Modified the GMPL API (CREATE^GMPLUTL) so that it processes and 
 stores the correct date of interest (ICD-9 encounter date in this case) 
 appropriately.
  
 15. After some analysis, it was determined that the re-indexing logic was 
 no longer needed and could be removed, since the Problem file DD is 
 exported along with the indexes. This prevents the reminder evaluation 
 error messages from occurring.
  
 16. Modified the subroutine that retrieves the mapped ICD-9 codes so that 
 it is date of interest aware and utilizes the correct mapping definition 
 for retrieval. This allows for the appropriate retrieval and storage of 
 the correct secondary ICD-9 codes to the Problem file.
