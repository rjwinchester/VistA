 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC000000245400 - Duplicate Record Identified
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When a user runs the Identify Potential Merge Problems [XDR VALID CHECK] 
 option, in some instances they may get the errors similar to the one 
 below:
  
   Field .3602 [MILITARY DISABILITY RETIREMENT] IENS=242217, value: 0^NO
   Eligibility verified at the HEC...NO EDITING!
  
 Next, when the Schedule Process to Merge Verified Duplicates [XDR MERGE
 READY DUPLICATES] option is run, the merge may or may not fail because of
 the errors listed when the Identify Potential Merge Problems [XDR VALID
 CHECK] was run.
    
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The Identify Potential Merge Problems [XDR VALID CHECK] menu option is not
 a precise predictor of whether or not a patient merge should fail due to
 data validation problems. 
  
 The VA Documentation Library (VDL) will be updated to include an
 explanation of the differences between the Identify Potential Merge 
 Problems [XDR VALID CHECK] option and the Schedule Process to Merge
 Verified Duplicates [XDR MERGE READY DUPLICATES] option when they
 validate fields.
  
  
 2. INC000000241993 - Problem Merging Patient Data in a file with 3 NEW 
                      Style X-REF's  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If a file is pointing to the PATIENT file (#2) by its .01 field, and if 
 that .01 field is DINUM'd, and the cross reference is a new style cross
 reference then the cross reference is not being properly merged by the
 patient merge process. An example of a field with a cross reference of 
 this type is the FLUORIDE MONITOR RUN DATE field (#5) of the DENTAL 
 PATIENT file (#220).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine ^XDRMERG2 to check for new style cross-references and
 if so call ^DIQ to get the field data from the 'FROM' patient, then call
 ^DIE to add the data to the 'TO' Patient.
  
  
 3. INC000000237030 - Alias during merge can make a duplicate alias 
   
 Problem:
 --------
 If a patient is merged into another patient that has a matching name 
 ALIAS field (#2.01,.01) and matching ALIAS SSN field (#2.01,1) then the 
 ALIAS is being duplicated in the merged patient. For example:
  
    Patient Name                            Patient Alias
    ------------                            -------------
    1) SMITH,GARRY (ssn: 111-22-3333)       SMITH,GORDON (ssn:222-33-2222)
                                            SMITH,BYRON  (ssn:444-33-4444)
  
    2) SMITH,GARY (ssn: 000-00-9000)        SMITH,GORDON (ssn:222-33-2222)
                                            SMITH,TREY   (ssn:222-33-9090)
  
  The result of merging Patient #1 above into Patient #2 would have been:
  
    Patient Name                          Patient Alias
    ------------                          -------------
     SMITH,GARY (ssn: 000-00-9000)         SMITH,GORDON (ssn:222-33-2222)
                                           SMITH,GORDON (ssn:222-33-2222) 
                                           SMITH,BYRON  (ssn:444-33-4444)
                                           SMITH,TREY   (ssn:222-33-9090)
                                           SMITH,GARRY  (ssn:111-22-3333)
   
 SMITH,GORDON (ssn:222-33-2222) would be duplicated as an alias in the
 resulting patient.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine ^XDRMERGA to check the Patient file (#2) ALIAS 
 multiple field (#2.01) of the merging records for matching name ALIAS
 and ALIAS SSN.  If so, then the alias is excluded from the patient merge.
  
 4. INC000000217841 - Test Patient Indicator remains after merge
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If a patient who has the TEST PATIENT INDICATOR field (# .6) of the
 PATIENT file (#2) set to 'YES' is merged into a patient who does not
 have the TEST PATIENT INDICATOR set to 'YES' then the resulting patient
 WILL have the TEST PATIENT INDICATOR set to 'YES'.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine ^XDRMERGA to add a warning message and verification
 prompt to the Approve verified duplicates for merging
 [XDR APPROVE FOR MERGE]. If the user chooses to merge a TEST patient into
 a real patient they are prompted 'Merge the above pair (a test patient
 into a real patient) SURE?'. A response of 'Y' or 'N' is required. Routine
 ^XDRMERGB was modified so that If they answer 'Y' then the TEST PATIENT
 INDICATOR field (# .6) is not merged. If they Answer 'N' then the pair is
 not approved and will not be merged.
  
 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 ------------------------ 
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
      download.vista.domain.ext, which will transmit the files from the
      first available FTP server.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from the 
      ANONYMOUS SOFTWARE DIRECTORY from a specific server as follows:
  
      Albany          ftp.domain.ext
      Hines           ftp.domain.ext
      Salt Lake City  ftp.domain.ext
  
      The documentation distribution includes: 
  
      File Name                   Description              Retrieval Format
      =========                   ===========              ================
