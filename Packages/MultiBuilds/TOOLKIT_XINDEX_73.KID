Description:
"BLD",1550,1,2,0)
===========
"BLD",1550,1,3,0)
This patch supports the change of the SAC for longer Tags and Routine
"BLD",1550,1,4,0)
names.  It increases the length from 8 to 16 characters.  
"BLD",1550,1,5,0)
 
"BLD",1550,1,6,0)
This patch also makes several changes to the ZOSFONT routine, but only
"BLD",1550,1,7,0)
the ^%ZOSF("TEST") node will be set.
"BLD",1550,1,8,0)
 
"BLD",1550,1,9,0)
The routine ZOSFONT has the following changes:
"BLD",1550,1,10,0)
   1. A new tag, NOASK, allows the setup of the %ZOSF global 
"BLD",1550,1,11,0)
      without user interaction.
"BLD",1550,1,12,0)
 
"BLD",1550,1,13,0)
   2. A new tag, ONE(X) allows the setup of a single node in 
"BLD",1550,1,14,0)
      the %ZOSF global.  This allows this patch to update just
"BLD",1550,1,15,0)
      %ZOSF("TEST").
"BLD",1550,1,16,0)
 
"BLD",1550,1,17,0)
   3. There is now a short description for each %ZOSF node in 
"BLD",1550,1,18,0)
      the text.
"BLD",1550,1,19,0)
 
"BLD",1550,1,20,0)
There are 2 changes to the ^%ZOSF global:
"BLD",1550,1,21,0)
  1. The node ^%ZOSF("TEST") has changed, the checking of routine pattern
"BLD",1550,1,22,0)
     has been removed.  It has changed from:
"BLD",1550,1,23,0)
      I X?1(1""%"",1A).7AN,$D(^$ROUTINE(X))  to
"BLD",1550,1,24,0)
      I X]"",$D(^$ROUTINE(X)).
"BLD",1550,1,25,0)
 The checking of routine pattern has been removed.
"BLD",1550,1,26,0)
 
"BLD",1550,1,27,0)
The post install routine XU8661 cleans up the ^%ZOSF global.
"BLD",1550,1,28,0)
   1. The node ^%ZOSF("GSEL;Select Globals") is deleted.  This 
"BLD",1550,1,29,0)
      node was incorrectly defined in patch XU*8*365.
"BLD",1550,1,30,0)
 
"BLD",1550,1,31,0)
   2. Sets ^%ZOSF("TEST")
"BLD",1550,1,32,0)
 
"BLD",1550,1,33,0)

Description:
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,2,0)
===========
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,3,0)
This patch supports the change of the SAC for longer Tags and Routine
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,4,0)
names.  It increases the length from 8 to 16 characters.  
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,5,0)
 
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,6,0)
This patch also makes several changes to the ZOSFONT routine, but only
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,7,0)
the ^%ZOSF("TEST") node will be set.
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,8,0)
 
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,9,0)
The routine ZOSFONT has the following changes:
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,10,0)
   1. A new tag, NOASK, allows the setup of the %ZOSF global 
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,11,0)
      without user interaction.
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,12,0)
 
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,13,0)
   2. A new tag, ONE(X) allows the setup of a single node in 
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,14,0)
      the %ZOSF global.  This allows this patch to update just
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,15,0)
      %ZOSF("TEST").
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,16,0)
 
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,17,0)
   3. There is now a short description for each %ZOSF node in 
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,18,0)
      the text.
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,19,0)
 
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,20,0)
There are 2 changes to the ^%ZOSF global:
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,21,0)
  1. The node ^%ZOSF("TEST") has changed, the checking of routine pattern
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,22,0)
     has been removed.  It has changed from:
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,23,0)
      I X?1(1""%"",1A).7AN,$D(^$ROUTINE(X))  to
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,24,0)
      I X]"",$D(^$ROUTINE(X)).
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,25,0)
 The checking of routine pattern has been removed.
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,26,0)
 
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,27,0)
The post install routine XU8661 cleans up the ^%ZOSF global.
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,28,0)
   1. The node ^%ZOSF("GSEL;Select Globals") is deleted.  This 
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,29,0)
      node was incorrectly defined in patch XU*8*365.
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,30,0)
 
"PKG",3,22,1,"PAH",1,1,31,0)
   2. Sets ^%ZOSF("TEST")
