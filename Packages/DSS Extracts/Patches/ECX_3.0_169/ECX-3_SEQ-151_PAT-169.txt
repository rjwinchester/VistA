Subject: DSS FY 2018 SUSTAINMENT UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Since the release of the FY18 DSS Sustainment patch, ECX*3.0*166, a
 couple of issues have been identified.  The first issue is in the PRO
 extract.  Under certain circumstances, it's possible for prosthetics
 records to be skipped that should be included in the extract.  The second 
 issue is that the treating specialty extract audit report shows no records
 even if there are records in the selected extract.
  
 During the release of the patch, it was noted that the patch application 
 line, typically line 2 of any routine, incorrectly noted the patches 
 applied to routine ECXWRD.
  
 This patch will address these issues.
  
 Problem #1: Prosthetics extract not correctly counting workload

   ASSOCIATED NSR:
   ===============
   N/A
  
   Problem:  
   --------
   When the prosthetics extract is run, it's possible for the extract to
   skip records that should be included in the extract.  This causes the
   extract to incorrectly identify workload for the extract period.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Routine ECXPRO was modified so that the extracting station number isn't
   changed from its original value.  Inadvertent modification of the
   extracting station number caused records to be skipped.
  
 Problem #2: Treating specialty extract audit report doesn't report any 
             records.
  
   ASSOCIATED CA Service Desk:
   ==========================
   N/A
  
   ASSOCIATED NSR:

   N/A
  
   Problem:  
   --------
   When the treating specialty extract audit report is run the report
   indicates that there are no records to show.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Routine ECXATRT was modified so that the extract record would be 
   included in the report regardless of the value found in the facility
   field for that record.
  
 Problem #3: Routine ECXWRD has an incorrect patch history
  
   ASSOCIATED CA Service Desk:
   ==========================
   N/A
  
   ASSOCIATED NSR:
   ===============
   N/A
  
   Problem:  
   -------- 
   After release of the patch, it was discovered that the patch history
   listing for routine ECXWRD was incorrect.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The second line of routine ECXWRD was changed so that the proper patch
   history, including patch 169, is now shown.
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Boston
