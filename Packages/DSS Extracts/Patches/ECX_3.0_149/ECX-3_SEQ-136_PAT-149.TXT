Description:
============

  
 ***********************************************************************
 ** This patch is being released with an Emergency status because of  **
 ** the shortened compliance date and must be installed in all        **
 ** systems no later than the compliance requirement date. This patch **
 ** must be installed on or before 11/04/14 so that the October DSS   **
 ** Extracts can be generated using the updated Fiscal Year 15 logic. **
 ** Failure to comply with the installation date will cause delays in **
 ** extracting and reporting data.                                    **
 ***********************************************************************
  
 The DSS FY15 Extract Enhancements shall provide the means of exporting 
 data from selected VistA software modules and transmitting it to a DSS 
 database residing at the AITC (Austin Information Technology Center). This
 transfer is accomplished through a set of extract routines, intermediate
 files, and transmission routines. Data from VistA packages is stored by
 the extract routines in the intermediate files, where it is temporarily
 available for local use and auditing. The data is then transmitted to the
 AITC, where it is formatted and uploaded into commercial software.
  
 While not a pre-requisite for installing this patch, it is suggested that 
 patches SD*5.3*616 and LR*5.2*441 be installed right before installing 
 this patch.  The SD and LR patches contain related updates for the DSS 
 software for this fiscal year update.
  
 Included in the DSS FY15 scope are: 
      o       DSS Extract field additions and modifications
      o       DSS menu additions and modifications
      o       New DSS reports and report modifications
      o       Changes related to user, technical, or business 
              documentation.

 The following is a list of product features for this release:
 =============================================================
 1.  Add three new fields; REASON 1, REASON 2, and REASON 3 to the ECS
     and ECQ extracts.
  
 2.  Add a new field called PRIMARY PROCEDURE to the CLI extract.
  
 3.  Add a new field called NEW SCRIPT to the UDP extract.
  
 4.  Change field named CNH/SH Status to CNH Status in the BCM, ECS, ECQ,
     IVP, PRE, PRO, and UDP extracts.
  
 5.  Disable the NUT extract option so that the extract is no longer
     available.
  
 6.  Remove NUT from all reports and options.
  
 7.  Change source for the RAD extract.  Currently, exams are identified
     in the RAD/NUC MED PATIENT file (#70).  After patch installation, the
     RAD extract will now use the RAD/NUC MED REPORTS file (#74) to
     identify exams that are verified.  This change identifies work 
     completed rather than work ordered for populating the RAD extract.
  
 8.  Add a new field called PATHOLOGIST to the LAB extract.  Related patch
     LR*5.2*441 will identify the pathologist and store it in the WKLD
     LOG FILE (#64.03), which is the source for the LAB extract.
  
 9.  Add a new field called PATHOLOGIST PERSON CLASS to the LAB extract.
  
 10. Add a new field called PATHOLOGIST PROVIDER NPI to the LAB extract.
  
 11. Add a new field called COMBAT VETERAN INDICATOR to the ADM, BCM,
     CLI, ECS, ECQ, IVP, PRE, PRO, SUR, UDP extracts.
  
 12. Add a new field called COMBAT VETERAN LOCATION to the ADM, BCM, CLI,
     ECS, ECQ, IVP, PRE, PRO, SUR, UDP extracts.
  
 13. Correct header in extract message emails so that the email's subject
     line correctly indicates the total number of messages.  Previously,
     this information was being truncated.
  
 14. Modify the Prosthetics Unusual Cost Report so that the actual
     PSAS HCPCS code is displayed.  In addition, the type of transaction
     will also display indicating New (N), Repair (X), or Rental (R).
  
 15. Modify the Prosthetics Extract Audit report to include previously
     missing NPPD categories.
  
 16. Modify reports based on the CLINIC AND STOP CODES file (#728.44)
     so that any entry that is no longer a clinic is filtered from
     appearing on the report.  The Enter/Edit DSS Stop Code for Clinics,
     DSS Identifier Non-Conforming Clinics Report, and the DSS Clinic
     & Stop Codes Validity Report have been updated.
  
 17. Add a new option that will identify any clinics with the same DSS stop
     code, DSS credit stop code, CHAR4 code, clinic length, and division.
     This new option identifying duplicate clinics will appear in the
     Clinics and DSS Stop Codes Print Option.
  
 18. Modify the extract transmission routine so that any data that contains
     an exclamation point (!) will have it replaced with a space.
  
 19. Remove special fiscal year report selection from the IV Unusual Volume
     Report.
  
 20. Modify reports to consistently use the term "credit stop code".
  
 21. Update logic for the blood bank (LBB) extract so that data is coming
     solely from the VBECS blood bank system.
  
 22. Exportability of the National Clinic Codes for DSS list report.
     Report can now be displayed in a caret delimited format.
  
 23. Exportability of the Clinic Edit Log Report. This change will occur
     in related patch SD*5.3*616. Report can now be displayed in a caret
     delimited format.
  
 24. Exportability of the Print IV Room Worksheet report. Report can now be
     displayed in a caret delimited format.

     now be displayed in a caret delimited format.

 28. Exportability of the Primary Care Team Print Report.
     Report can now be displayed in a caret delimited format.
  
 29. Exportability of the Unusual Volume Report for Event Capture Report.
