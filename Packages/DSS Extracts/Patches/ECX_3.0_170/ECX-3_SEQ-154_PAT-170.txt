Description:
============

 ***********************************************************************
 ** This patch is being released with an Emergency status because of  **
 ** the shortened compliance date and must be installed in all        **
 ** systems no later than the compliance requirement date. This patch **
 ** must be installed on or before 11/05/18 so that the October DSS   **
 ** Extracts can be generated using the updated Fiscal Year 19 logic. **
 ** Failure to comply with the installation date will cause delays in **
 ** extracting and reporting data.                                    **
 ***********************************************************************
  
 The MCAO FY19 Extract Enhancements shall provide the means of exporting 
 data from selected VistA software modules and transmitting it to an MCAO 
 database residing at the AITC (Austin Information Technology Center). This
 transfer is accomplished through a set of extract routines, intermediate
 files, and transmission routines. Data from VistA packages is stored by
 the extract routines in the intermediate files, where it is temporarily
 available for local use and auditing. The data is then transmitted to the
 AITC, where it is formatted and uploaded into commercial software.
  
 *While not a pre-requisite for installing this patch, it is suggested that
 patch LR*5.2*510 be installed right before installing this patch.  The LR
 patch contains related updates for the MCAO software for this fiscal year
 update. 
  
 Included in the MCAO FY19 scope are:
  
      o       MCAO Extract field additions and modifications
      o       MCAO menu additions and modifications
      o       MCAO report modifications
      o       Changes related to user, technical, or business 
              documentation.

 The following is a list of product features for this release:
 =============================================================
 1.  Validate data dictionary descriptions for accuracy.
  
 2.  Modify the laboratory extract to collect production division 
     information based on where the test was performed.
  
 3.  Modify the laboratory extract to collect patient division information 
     based on the location that ordered/accessioned the test.
  
 4.  Modify the maintenance menu so that the View G&L Corrections option is
     added to the menu.
  
 5.  Modify the Prosthetics Rental Payments Report to include PSAS
     HCPCS code descriptions.
  
 6.  Modify the ADM extract to have an admission record when the patient
     goes ASIH (other facility). 
  
 7.  Modify logic to determine admission date/time and discharge date/time
     when a patient has an ASIH other facility movement.  In this case, the
     admission date/time will be the ASIH start date/time and the discharge
     date/time will be the date/time patient ended their ASIH episode of 
     care.
  
 8.  Modify the encounter number creation logic to use the date/time of the
     ASIH other facility movement if the patient was in this status at the
     time of service.
  
 9.  Modify the CLI extract logic to no longer automatically assign stop 
     code 479.
  
 10. Created a report that will identify any inactive/invalid CPT codes
     associated with radiology extract records.  This new report will be
     added to the extract audit reports menu.
  
 11. Modified the feeder key logic to create an NDC when the pharmacy item
     is a supply item and does not have an NDC code assigned.  In those 
     cases, the NDC portion of the feeder key will be the letters "LCL"
     concatenated with the IEN of the item from file 50.  If the IEN is 
     less than 9 characters, the number will be left padded with zeroes.
  
 12. Changed field name from ETHNICITY to PLACEHOLD ETHNICITY in the ADM,
     BCM, CLI, ECQ, ECS, IVP, PRE, PRO, SUR and UDP extracts as the field 
     is no longer needed.
  
 13. Changed field name from RACE to PLACEHOLD RACE in the ADM, CLI, PRE
     and PRO extracts as the field is no longer needed.
  
 14. Changed field name from RACE 1 to PLACEHOLD RACE 1 in the ADM, BCM,
     CLI, ECQ, ECS,IVP, PRE, PRO, SUR and UDP extracts as the field is no
     longer needed.
  
 15. Modified the Admission Extract Audit report to include records that 
     are missing the ward or the treating specialty.
  
 16. Modified the encounter number logic for IVP so that IVs in selected
     drug classes (chemo drugs) would have the stop code associated with
     the clinic where the drug was administered rather than "PHA".
  
 17. Modified the ECS extract logic so that chaplain workload, in specific 
     procedure code ranges, will change the selected patient's SSN and Name
     to contrived values.  The associated encounter number will also use 
     the contrived SSN.
  
 18. Added new values to the MCA Labor Code file so that group labor codes 
     can now be used.
  
 19. Modified the LAB extract logic to include a CPT code if the workload 
     code ended in 5184 or 5186.
  
 20. Modified the LAR extract so that the first 35 characters of the result
     is now stored. The existing RESULTS field was renamed PLACEHOLD
     RESULTS and a new field called LONG RESULT was added.  This update
     requires lab patch LR*5.2*510.
  
 21. Modified the ECS extract logic to not count 'late' state home 
     spreadsheet records if the procedure date/time was in the prior fiscal
     year.
  
 22. Modified the MOV extract so that a record is added for the return from
     ASIH other facility.
   
 23. Modified the SSN checking logic so that SSNs in the 900 series or that
     end with 0000 are considered invalid.
  
 24. Modified the IVP source audit report so that it will run to completion
     even when the ward value encountered is invalid.
  
 25. Created a new report that will identify invalid/inactive stop codes in
     the CLI, ECS, and RAD extracts.  This report was added to the extract 
     audit reports menu.
  
 26. Changed field name from PRIMARY CARE TEAM to PLACEHOLD PRIMARY CARE
     TEAM in the ADM, BCM, CLI, ECQ, ECS, IVP, LAB, PRE, PRO, RAD, SUR and
     UDP extracts as the field is no longer needed.
  
 27. Changed field name from PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER to PLACEHOLD PC PROVIDER
     in the ADM, BCM, CLI, ECQ, ECS, IVP, LAB, PRE, PRO, RAD, SUR and UDP
     extracts as the field is no longer needed.
  
 28. Changed field name from PC PROVIDER PERSON CLASS to PLACEHOLD PC 
     PROVIDER in the ADM, ECQ, ECS, IVP, LAB, PRE, PRO, RAD, SUR and UDP
     extracts as the field is no longer needed.
  
 29. Changed field name from PRIMARY CARE PRV PERSON CLASS to PLACEHOLD PC
     PROV PERSON CLASS in the CLI extract as the field is no longer needed.
  
 30. Changed field name from PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER NPI to PLACEHOLD PC 
     PROVIDER NPI in the ADM, BCM, CLI, ECQ, ECS, IVP, LAB, PRE, PRO, RAD,
     SUR and UDP extracts as the field is no longer needed.
  
 31. Changed field name from ASSOCIATE PC PROVIDER to PLACEHOLD ASSOC PC 
     PROVIDER in the ADM, CLI, ECQ, ECS, IVP, LAB, PRE, PRO, RAD, SUR and 
     UDP extracts as the field is no longer needed.
  
 32. Changed field name from ASSOC. PC PROV. PERSON CLASS to PLACEHOLD AS
     PC PROV PERSON CLASS in the ADM, ECQ, ECS, IVP, LAB, PRE, PRO, RAD,
     SUR and UDP extracts as the field is no longer needed.
  
 33. Changed field name from ASSOCIATE PC PROV PERSON CLASS to PLACEHOLD AS
     PC PROV PERSON CLASS in the CLI extract as the field is no longer
     needed.
  
 34. Changed field name from ASSOCIATE PC PROVIDER NPI to PLACEHOLD ASSOC
     PC PROV NPI in the ADM, CLI, ECQ, ECS, IVP, LAB, PRE, PRO, RAD, SUR
     and UDP extracts as the field is no longer needed.
  
 35. Changed field name from CPT CODE QTY & MODIFIERS #1 to PLACEHOLD CPT
     QTY & MODS #1 in the CLI extract as the field is no longer needed.
