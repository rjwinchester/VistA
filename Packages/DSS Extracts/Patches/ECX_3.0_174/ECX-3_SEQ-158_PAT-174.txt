Description:
============

 ***********************************************************************
 ** This patch is being released with an Emergency status because of  **
 ** the shortened compliance date and must be installed in all        **
 ** systems no later than the compliance requirement date. This patch **
 ** must be installed on or before 11/05/19 so that the October DSS   **
 ** Extracts can be generated using the updated Fiscal Year 20 logic. **
 ** Failure to comply with the installation date will cause delays in **
 ** extracting and reporting data.                                    **
 ***********************************************************************
  
 The MCAO FY20 Extract Enhancements shall provide the means of exporting 
 data from selected VistA software modules and transmitting it to an MCAO 
 database residing at the AITC (Austin Information Technology Center). This
 transfer is accomplished through a set of extract routines, intermediate
 files, and transmission routines. Data from VistA packages is stored by
 the extract routines in the intermediate files, where it is temporarily
 available for local use and auditing. The data is then transmitted to the
 AITC, where it is formatted and uploaded into commercial software.
  
 Included in the MCAO FY20 scope are:
  
      o       MCAO Extract field additions and modifications
      o       MCAO menu additions and modifications
      o       MCAO report modifications
      o       Changes related to user, technical, or business 
              documentation.

 The following is a list of product features for this release:
 =============================================================
  
 1.  Validate data dictionary descriptions for accuracy.
  
 2.  Changed field name from RELIGION to PLACEHOLD RELIGION in the ADM
     extract as the field is no longer needed.
  
 3.  Changed field name from ADM DRG to PLACEHOLD ADM DRG in the ADM 
     extract as the field is no longer needed.
  
 4.  Changed field name from SHARING AGREEMENT PAYOR to PLACEHOLD SHARE
     AGREEMNT PAYOR in the ADM, CLI, PRE, and PRO extracts as the field is 
     no longer needed.
  
 5.  Changed field name from NATIONAL PATIENT RECORD FLAG to PLACEHOLD 
     NAT'L PAT REC FLAG in the ADM and CLI extracts as the field is no 
     longer needed.
  
 6.  Changed field name from DSS PRODUCT DEPARTMENT to PLACEHOLD DSS 
     PRODUCT DEPT in the CLI extract as the field is no longer needed.
  
 7.  Added the SERVICE CONNECTED STATUS field to the CLI extract and 
     modified the CLI extract logic to populate this field with the 
     patient's service connected status.
  
 8.  Modified various fields in the IVP and UDP extract files to update 
     the technical descriptions to give additional details on the source 
     of the data in the pharmacy package.
  
 9.  Modified the PRO extract logic so that all monthly rental transactions
     will be expressed in days, rather than months.  In addition, various
     prosthetics reports were updated to include a note indicating that
     monthly rentals are now expressed in days.
  
 10. Modified the SUR extract logic to get the stop code for outpatient
     procedures. If no associated clinic can be identified, then the stop
     code will default to 435 for NON-OR based procedures or 429 for all
     other procedures. The encounter number logic was also modified to use 
     the stop code provided without changing it due to the surgical
     specialty.
  
 11. Modified the feeder key logic to create an NDC when the pharmacy item
     is a drug item and does not have an NDC code assigned and isn't 
     linked to a national drug file entry. In those cases, the NDC portion
     of the feeder key will be the letters "LCD" concatenated with the IEN
     of the item from file 50.  If the IEN is less than 9 characters, the
     number will be left padded with zeroes. The previously added "LCL" 
     logic for supply items was modified to only update when both the NDC 
     and the national drug file link were missing.
  
 12. Removed options Add/Edit Lab Results Translation Table and Lab 
     Results Extract Untranslatable Results Report from the Lab 
     Maintenance menu.  The Lab Results DSS LOINC Code Report option was 
     moved from the Lab Maintenance menu to the Maintenance menu.  The Lab 
     Maintenance menu was also deleted.
  
 13. Modified the MOV extract logic so that the treating specialty at 
     discharge is now stored in the TREATING SPECIALTY field.  In addition,
     the description and technical description were updated in the TREATING
     SPECIALTY field.
  
 14. Created a new report for cost by feeder key for each of the pharmacy 
     related extracts; IVP, PRE, UDP, and BCM.
  
 15. Modified the LAB extract logic to obtain CPT codes for all workload 
     where CPT code information is available.  Previously, this was only 
     collected for specific lab workload.
  
 16. Changed field name from COST OF TRANSACTION to PLACEHOLD COST OF 
     TRANSACTION in the PRO extract as the field is being replaced.
  
 17. Changed field name from LAB LABOR COST to PLACEHOLD LAB LABOR COST in 
     the PRO extract as the field is being replaced.
  
 18. Changed field name from LAB MATERIAL COST to PLACEHOLD LAB MATERIAL 
     COST in the PRO extract as the field is being replaced.
  
 19. Added field NEW COST OF TRANSACTION to the PRO extract and modified
     the PRO extract logic to populate the field.
  
 20. Added field NEW LAB LABOR COST to the PRO extract and modified the 
     PRO extract logic to populate the field.
  
 21. Added field NEW LAB MATERIAL COST to the PRO extract and modified the 
     PRO extract logic to populate the field.
  
 22. Modified the MOV extract to remove the TYPE field as it is no longer 
     needed.
   
 23. Changed field name from DSS IP# to PLACEHOLD DSS IP# in the CLI, ECS, 
     ECQ, IVP, LAB, LBB, PRE, PRO, RAD, and UDP extracts as the field is no
     longer needed.
  
 24. Changed field name from ENCOUNTER SC to PLACEHOLD ENCOUNTER SC in the 
     LAB, LBB, LAR, PRE, PRO, and RAD extracts as the field is no longer 
     needed.
  
 25. Modified the instructions for capturing output to be exported to be 
     consistent with the current reflections software.
  
 26. Modified the Print Feeder Locations Report so that the user can 
     select one, many, or all feeder systems.  In addition, the station
     number associated with each feeder location is now included in the
     report.
  
 27. Created a new report that will show institution and division 
     information for the site.
  
 28. Modified the BCM extract logic to handle values in the unit of 
     administration and doses given fields of the BCMA MEDICATION LOG file 
     that could be incorrectly processed as exponential numbers.
  
 29. Modified the Pharmacy Unusual Volume report so that any entries that 
     could be incorrectly processed as exponential numbers are correctly 
     handled.
  
 30. Modified the Prosthetics Rental Report so that all rentals are 
     displayed. Added the ability to sort by division and added the unit of
     issue and division to the report.
  
 31. Modified the UDP extract so that the setting of the division is based 
     on the ward if it's an inpatient or on the clinic if it's a clinic 
     medication (inpatient medication for outpatients).
  
 32. Updated the help text for the Action to Send prompt in the Enter/Edit 
     Clinic Parameters option to reflect recent changes.
  
 33. Modified the Print Feeder Keys option to allow for sorting the PHA 
     feeder system by drug or non-drug.  Also modified the logic so that 
     feeder keys that contain LCL or LCD are included.
  
 34. Changed field name from ENCOUNTER CAMP LEJEUNE to PLACEHOLD ENC CAMP 
     LEJEUNE in the LAR, PRE, PRO, and RAD extracts as the field is no
     longer needed.
  
 35. Changed field name from ENCOUNTER SHAD to PLACEHOLD ENCOUNTER SHAD in 
     the PRE and PRO extracts as the field is no longer needed.
   
 36. Changed field name from ENCOUNTER CV to PLACEHOLD ENCOUNTER CV in the
     PRE and PRO extracts as the field is no longer needed.
   
 37. Changed field name from ENCOUNTER SWAC to PLACEHOLD ENCOUNTER SWAC
     in the PRE and PRO extracts as the field is no longer needed.
   
 38. Changed field name from AGENT ORANGE ENC INDICATOR to PLACEHOLD 
     AGENT ORANGE ENC in the PRO and PRE extracts as the field is no longer
     needed.
   
 39. Changed field name from ENC HEAD/NECK CA to PLACEHOLD ENC HEAD/NECK CA
     in the PRO and PRE extracts as the field is no longer needed.
   
 40. Changed field name from ENCOUNTER MST to PLACEHOLD ENCOUNTER MST in
     the PRO and PRE extracts as the field is no longer needed.
   
 41. Changed field name from RADIATION ENCOUNTER INDICATOR to PLACEHOLD
     RADIATION ENCOUNTER in the PRO and PRE extracts as the field is no
     longer needed.

     SHARE AGREEMNT INSUR in the CLI extract as the field is no longer
     needed.

     additional information about ASIH other facility movements.
  
 45. Added field NON-COUNT FLAG to the CLI extract and modified the CLI
     extract logic to populate the field.
  
 46. Added field STATE HOME NAME to the ECS extract and modified the ECS 
     extract logic to populate the field.
  
 47. Modified the missing clinics email that is sent when the CLI extract 
     is run and the clinic isn't found in the CLINICS AND STOP CODES file 
     (#728.44). Previously, the email was showing the IEN of the stop code.
     It was updated to show the actual stop code.
  
 48. Added field VISTA DEA SPECIAL HDLG to the BCM, IVP, PRE, and UDP 
     extracts and modified the extract logic in each to populate the field.
  
 49. Changed field name from LAB RESULTS TRANSLATION to PLACEHOLD LAB 
     RESULTS TRANS in the LAR extract as the field is no longer needed.
  
 50. Modified the logic in the PRE extract so that prescriptions that are
     part of the Community Care Network (CCN) program are identified in the
     REMARKS field of the PRESCRIPTION EXTRACT file (#727.81).
