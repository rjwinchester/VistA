Subject: DSS FY 2015 SUSTAINMENT UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Since the release of the DSS FY 15 Sustainment patch ECX*3*149, three 
 issues have been identified.  The first issue is with the laboratory 
 pre-extract audit report not running when queued.  The second issue is 
 with the laboratory blood bank comparative report.  For the source side 
 of the report, it always shows "no data".  The third issue is the 
 radiology extract is not counting workload when the site is using site 
 specific accession numbering.  This patch will correct these three issues.
  
 Problem #1: Can't queue the laboratory blood bank pre-extract audit 
 report.

   ASSOCIATED NSR:
   ===============
   N/A
  
   Problem:  
   --------
   The Laboratory Blood Bank (LBB) Pre-Extract Audit [ECX LBB SOURCE AUDIT]
   report can no longer be queued.  The report, by default, is queued to 
   run in the background.  When running the report, taskman will reject
   the task with a "no routine at destination" error.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The routine ECXPLBB was updated so that the correct routine is called
   when the report is queued.
  
 Problem #2: The laboratory blood bank (LBB) comparative report incorrectly
 shows "no data" on source side of report.

   INC000001081841    DSS - Extract Issue:
  
  
   ASSOCIATED NSR:
   ===============
   N/A
  
   Problem:
   --------
   The laboratory blood bank (LBB) comparative report [ECX LBB SOURCE 
   AUDIT COMPAR] will display ***************N*O***D*A*T*A*****************
   on the LOCAL BLOOD BANK SOURCE side of the report, even if there is
   data.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The routine ECXLBBC was modified to correctly identify the location
   where the source side data was being stored so that it could be 
   displayed correctly on the report.
  
 Problem #3: The radiology extract will not identify workload when the 
 site has the USE SITE ACCESSION NUMBER? field (#.131) of the RAD/NUC MED 
 DIVISION file (#79) set to yes.
  
   ASSOCIATED REMEDY:
   ==================
   INC000001082268    DSS - Extract Issue:
   INC000001082997    DSS - RAD Extract not working. results = 0 
  
    
   ASSOCIATED NSR:
   ===============
   N/A
   
   Problem:  
   --------
   Sites that have set the USE SITE ACCESSION NUMBER? field to yes, 
   indicating that all case numbers should start with the station number,
   will not have those records counted when the radiology extract is
   run.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The radiology extract code was modified to correctly handle sites that
   are using the site specific numbering system.  The case numbers are 
   stored in one table if day-case number format is used and stored in a
   different table if the station number-day-case number format is used.
   The extract code now uses the correct table based on the numbering
   format employed at the site.
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Los Angeles
 Long Beach
 Boston
