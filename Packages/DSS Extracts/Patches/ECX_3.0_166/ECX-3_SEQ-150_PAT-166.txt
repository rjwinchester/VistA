Description:
============

 ***********************************************************************
 ** This patch is being released with an Emergency status because of  **
 ** the shortened compliance date and must be installed in all        **
 ** systems no later than the compliance requirement date. This patch **
 ** must be installed on or before 11/03/17 so that the October DSS   **
 ** Extracts can be generated using the updated Fiscal Year 18 logic. **
 ** Failure to comply with the installation date will cause delays in **
 ** extracting and reporting data.                                    **
 ***********************************************************************
  
 The MCAO FY18 Extract Enhancements shall provide the means of exporting 
 data from selected VistA software modules and transmitting it to an MCAO 
 database residing at the AITC (Austin Information Technology Center). This
 transfer is accomplished through a set of extract routines, intermediate
 files, and transmission routines. Data from VistA packages is stored by
 the extract routines in the intermediate files, where it is temporarily
 available for local use and auditing. The data is then transmitted to the
 AITC, where it is formatted and uploaded into commercial software.
  
 Included in the MCAO FY18 scope are:
  
      o       MCAO Extract field additions and modifications
      o       MCAO menu additions and modifications
      o       MCAO report modifications
      o       Changes related to user, technical, or business 
              documentation.

     file (#727.811) to identify the specialty credited to the provider 
     performing a non-OR procedure.

     of service (OOS) clinics have a default action to send of 5 (send stop
     codes without CHAR4 codes) when they're added to the DSS file.

     transplanted during a surgical transplant case.
  
 25. Modified the logic used during extract transmission so that a user
     cannot transmit an extract with zero records.  The logic was also
     modified to not allow transmission of an extract that is still being
     processed.
  
 26. Update the anesthesia technique field in the SURGERY EXTRACT file 
     (#727.811), as well as the data definitions document and the online

     records that were identified as being entered late by the event
     capture package.
  
 33. Modified the radiology extract to correctly calculate inverse dates
     so that all verified radiology records are extracted for the selected
     time frame.  Previously, records on the first day of the time frame
     were being skipped.
  
 34. Modified the IV extract to include both the date and time when
     determining the admission episode of care that's used to create the
     encounter number.  Previously, only the date was being sent which
     could cause the incorrect episode of care to be returned if the 
     patient had multiple movements on the same day.
