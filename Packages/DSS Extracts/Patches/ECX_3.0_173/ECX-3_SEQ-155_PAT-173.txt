Subject: DSS FY 2019 SUSTAINMENT UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Since the release of the FY19 DSS Sustainment patch, ECX*3.0*170, four
 issues have been identified.  
  
 The first issue is in the MOV extract. If a patient goes ASIH other 
 facility in one month (e.g. 2/28/18) and returns from ASIH other facility 
 in the next month (e.g. 3/2/18) the ending movement from 3/2/18 is being 
 included in the FEB extract, which is incorrect. The extract will now put 
 the records in the correct month.
  
 The second issue is related to the MOV extract audit report.  When a 
 patient returns from ASIH other facility, the discharge record that's 
 created does not have a ward.  As a result, the record is included in the 
 "missing wards" section of the report.  While this is correct, the user 
 doesn't know that this is an ASIH other facility related record, which 
 doesn't require any action.  The report will now indicate if the record 
 is an ASIH other facility type record.  Related to this report, the 
 "facility" field was not showing the facility, but was showing the ward 
 location.  This field will now show the facility information from the 
 MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file (#40.8).
  
 The third issue is related to the ADM extract audit report.  When a 
 patient goes ASIH other facility, an ADM record is created to show the 
 start of the ASIH other facility episode of care.  The ward stored with 
 that record is the ward the patient was on prior to going ASIH other 
 facility.  The ADM extract audit report was incorrectly counting this 
 record as an admission for that ward.  The report has been modified to 
 not count ASIH other facility records and will list them at the end of 
 the report in a separate section.
  
 The fourth issue is the creation of the DSS IDENTIFIER field in the Event 
 Capture extract.  In a recent Event Capture update, DSS units could now
 have a 'send to PCE' setting of OOS (Occasion Of Service).  This new 
 setting was not considered when building the DSS IDENTIFIER.  The stop 
 code was not correctly identified in this case, causing the DSS 
 IDENTIFIER to be all zeroes.
  
 Problem #1: MOV extract incorrectly storing records from outside of the 
 extract time frame.

   Problem:  
   --------
   When a patient goes ASIH other facility in one month and returns the 
   next month, the movement that ends the ASIH other facility episode of 
   care is incorrectly included in the current month's extract.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The routine ECXMOV was modified to exclude movements that are outside 
   of the extract timeframe.  If a movement that ends the ASIH other 
   facility episode of care is in the following month, the movement is 
   stored for review and inclusion when the next month's extract is 
   performed.
  
 Problem #2: The MOV extract audit report doesn't identify ASIH other 
 facility movements and the facility information in the missing wards 
 section is incorrect.
  
  
   SERVICE NOW TICKET:
   ===================
   INC3103077
  
   ASSOCIATED NSR:
   ===============
   N/A
  
   Problem:  
   --------
   ASIH other facility records do not have a ward associated with them.  
   As a result, they appear in the "missing wards" section of the report. 
   These records do not need to be fixed but there wasn't a way to identify
   these records as being ASIH other facility movements.  The report also 
   incorrectly identified a ward instead of the facility in the "facility" 
   field of the missing wards section of the report.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Routine ECXAMOV was modified to include a field that indicates if the 
   record is an ASIH other facility type record.  ASIH other facility 
   entries in the missing wards section of the report do not need to be 
   fixed.  This routine was also modified to get facility information from 
   the MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file (#40.8) rather than the WARD LOCATION 
   file (#42).
  
 Problem #3: The ADM extract audit report is incorrectly counting ASIH 
 other facility admissions.
  
   SERVICE NOW TICKET:
   ===================
   N/A
  
   ASSOCIATED NSR:
   ===============
   N/A
  
   Problem:  
   -------- 
   The ADM extract audit report is counting ASIH other facility 
   admissions.  This report should only count admissions to the parent 
   facility.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Routine ECXAADM was modified to skip records that are ASIH other 
   facility related.  The ASIH other facility records will now appear at 
   the end of the report in a separate section.
  
 Problem #4: Event Capture extract incorrectly builds the DSS IDENTIFIER.
  
   SERVICE NOW TICKET:
   ===================
   INC3456428  
  
   ASSOCIATED NSR:
   ===============
   N/A
  
   Problem:  
   --------
   When the DSS unit associated with the Event Capture workload has a 
   'send to PCE' setting of "OOS" the DSS IDENTIFIER is not using the stop 
   code associated with the clinic.  Instead, it's defaulting to 000.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Routine ECXEC was modified to check the DSS unit's 'send to PCE' 
   setting and if it's "OOS" then it will get the stop code from the 
   associated clinic.  Routine ECXQSR was also updated even though the 
   QUASAR extract does not use OOS related DSS units/clinics at this time.
