Subject: DSS FY 2016 SUSTAINMENT UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Since the release of the DSS FY 16 Annual Sustainment patch ECX*3*154,
 there have been a couple of issues identified.  The first issue is with
 the CBOC Activity Report.  The clinic data was moved in the CLINIC EXTRACT
 file (#727.827) and the report uses that information to group data on the
 report.  Extracts created using the FY16 logic will no longer have clinic
 data in the old location, which will cause an error in this report.  The 
 second issue is with the logic for determining if a medication given 
 throug BCMA is considered a multi-dose medication.  The multi-dose logic 
 is applied to both unit dose type medications as well as IV type 
 medications.  The logic is being modified so it only applies to unit dose 
 type medications.
  
 This patch will correct these issues.
  
 Problem #1: CBOC Activity report causes an error.

   Problem:  
   --------
   When a user attempts to run the CBOC Activity Report and selects an 
   extract that was created using the FY16 logic, the report throws an
   error and kicks the user off the system.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The routine ECXUCBOC was updated so that the clinic information is
   obtained from the correct location depending on the fiscal year logic
   used to create the extract.
  
  
 Problem #2: Certain IV orders are being missed by the BCMA extract

   ASSOCIATED NSR:

   Problem:  
   -------- 
   After release of the patch, it was determined that the logic for 
   determining multi-dose containers shouldn't apply to IV type orders.  
   In general, only unit dose type orders are delivered in multi-dose
   containers so the logic should only apply to those types of orders.  In
   addition, BCMA records with a status of infusing will now be considered
   for inclusion in the extract.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The logic in routine ECXBCM was changed so that a check is made to 
   determine if the order being processed in the BCMA extract is an IV or
   a unit dose type order.  If it's an IV type order the check to determine
   if the order is a multi-dose order is not applied.  Also, all BCMA 
   records with a status of infusing are now considered for inclusion in the
   extract.  The result is that all IV orders will be counted when doing the
   BCMA extract.
