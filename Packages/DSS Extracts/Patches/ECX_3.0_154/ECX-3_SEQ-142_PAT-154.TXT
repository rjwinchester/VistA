Description:
============

 ***********************************************************************
 ** This patch is being released with an Emergency status because of  **
 ** the shortened compliance date and must be installed in all        **
 ** systems no later than the compliance requirement date. This patch **
 ** must be installed on or before 11/06/15 so that the October DSS   **
 ** Extracts can be generated using the updated Fiscal Year 16 logic. **
 ** Failure to comply with the installation date will cause delays in **
 ** extracting and reporting data.                                    **
 ***********************************************************************
  
 The MCAO FY16 Extract Enhancements shall provide the means of exporting 
 data from selected VistA software modules and transmitting it to an MCAO 
 database residing at the AITC (Austin Information Technology Center). This
 transfer is accomplished through a set of extract routines, intermediate
 files, and transmission routines. Data from VistA packages is stored by
 the extract routines in the intermediate files, where it is temporarily
 available for local use and auditing. The data is then transmitted to the
 AITC, where it is formatted and uploaded into commercial software.
  
 While not a pre-requisite for installing this patch, it is suggested that 
 patches SD*5.3*633 and LR*5.2*455 be installed right before installing 
 this patch.  The SD and LR patches contain related updates for the MCAO 
 software for this fiscal year update.
  
 Included in the MCAO FY16 scope are: 
      o       MCAO Extract field additions and modifications
      o       MCAO menu additions and modifications
      o       MCAO report modifications
      o       Changes related to user, technical, or business 
              documentation.

 The following is a list of product features for this release:
 =============================================================
 1.  Make Laboratory Blood Bank (LBB) Comparative Report exportable.
  
 2.  Change all references from DSS Identifiers to Stop Code.
  
 3.  Remove the DSS Clinic Stop and DSS Credit Stop columns from all
     versions of the Clinics & Stop Codes Print report.
  
 4.  Change field name from NUTRITION DIAGNOSIS to PLACEHOLDER in the
     ECS and ECQ extracts.
  
 5.  Modify ECS extract logic so that certain chaplain workload can be
     entered for patients with 5 leading zeroes.
  
 6.  Change length of CLINIC IEN field in the ECS and ECQ extracts to allow
     for longer entries.  The currently existing field will be renamed to
     PLACEHOLDER while a new CLINIC IEN field is added to accommodate the
     longer field length. 
  
 7.  Populate related extracts with Camp Lejeune patient status 
     information. This is subject to the release of Camp Lejeune related
     patches which will be released at a future date.
  
 8.  Modify the CREATE DSS CLINIC STOP CODE FILE option logic so that
     the DSS CLINIC STOP and DSS CREDIT STOP fields in file 728.44 are
     populated from the STOP CODE and CREDIT STOP CODE fields from the
     corresponding entry in file 44.
  
 9.  Modify the ENTER/EDIT DSS STOP CODES FOR CLINICS option so that the
     DSS STOP CODE and DSS CLINIC STOP CODE fields can no longer be
     changed.  The option will also be renamed ENTER/EDIT CLINIC
     PARAMETERS.
  
 10. Modify the DSS IDENTIFIER NON-CONFORMING CLINICS REPORT by removing
     the DSS STOP CODE and DSS CREDIT STOP CODE fields from the report.  
     The option will also be renamed STOP CODE NON-CONFORMING CLINICS
     REPORT.
  
 11. Modify the DSS CLINIC & STOP CODES VALIDITY REPORT by removing the
     DSS STOP CODE and DSS CREDIT STOP CODE fields from the report.  The
     option will also be renamed CLINIC & STOP CODES VALIDITY REPORT.
  
 12. Modify all extract related audit reports so that an extract can be
     started from within the extract audit report.
  
 13. Add a new field called RAD VERIFY DATE to the RAD extract to identify
     the date the report was verified.
  
 14. Review all ACTION TO SEND values in file 728.44 and change any
     values of 3 or 7 to 5.  Values 3 and 7 were previously removed but
     existing data wasn't updated.
  
 15. Remove cost center conversion logic from ECS extract. Also, identify
     any existing "do not send" DSS units that don't have a stop code. A
     report will be generated as part of the patch installation identifying
     any DSS units that need to be reviewed.
  
 16. Modify ECS extract logic so that all records, regardless of stop code
     value will be stored.  Any invalid stop codes will be recorded in the
     extract and the encounter number will show "ECS" to identify records
     with an invalid stop code.
  
 17. Remove option SDEDIT LOCAL STOP CODE NAME from the Supervisor Menu 
     [SDSUP] as local stop codes have been inactivated.  This will be done
     in patch SD*5.3*633.
  
 18. Add BCM to pharmacy options in the maintenance menu.
  
 19. Modify UDP extract so that clinic orders don't report a ward, which
     has no meaning in this context.
  
 20. Modify ACTION TO SEND choices 4 and 5 to replace the word NATIONAL
     with CHAR4.
  
 21. Add a new field called CLINIC IEN to the CLI extract.  This field will
     replace the currently existing field called CLINIC NAME and that
     field's name will be changed to PLACEHOLDER.
  
 22. Modify logic in the ECS and ECQ extracts so that DSS Units that send
     no records will get the stop code, credit stop code and the CHAR4
     code from the DSS unit.
  
 23. Change the NATIONAL CLINIC CODES FOR DSS LIST option to CHAR4 CODES
     LIST.
  
 24. Allow a user to modify the DSS PRODUCT DEPARTMENT in the ENTER/EDIT
     CLINIC PARAMETERS option without causing the clinic to become
     unreviewed.
  
 25. Modify the PRO extract logic so that the cost field is populated when
     the form requested on is either stock issue or inventory issue.
  
 26. Modify the PRO extract feeder key logic so that a value of "S" (stock
     issue) or "I" (inventory issue) is appended if the form requested on
     is either stock issue or inventory issue.
  
 27. Allow for use and storage of ICD-10 related codes in the ADM, CLI,
     ECS, ECQ and SUR extracts in anticipation of the 10/1/15 
     implementation date.
  
 28. Modify BCM extract logic to only count the first administration of a
     medication not counted by the UDP or IVP extracts.  This will apply
     to medications determined to be multi-dose containers.
  
 29. Add a new field called FORM REQUESTED ON to the PRO extract.
     
 30. Add FORM REQUESTED ON to the printed and exported versions of the 
     COST BY PSAS HCPC REPORT and the PRO EXTRACT UNUSUAL COST REPORT.
  
 31. Modify LAB RESULTS EXTRACT UNTRANSLATABLE RESULTS REPORT so that up to
     30 characters of the result are returned.  In the printed version the
     result will have a + at the end to indicate there is more text.  The
     exported version will have the entire 30 characters available.  This
     change will be implemented in the LR*5.2*455 patch.
  
 32. Add a new field called REMARKS to the PRE extract.  This field will
     identify any prescriptions filled under the Veteran's Choice program.
  
 33. Disable BCM from the PHARMACY EXTRACTS UNUSUAL COST REPORT so that it
     can no longer be selected.
