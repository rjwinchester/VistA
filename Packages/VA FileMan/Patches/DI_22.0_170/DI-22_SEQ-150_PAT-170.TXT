 Issue #1
 --------
 Remedy Ticket 865632: Undefined error at SEARCH+5^DIC3
 (Routine: DIC)
  
   Given the following scenario:
     - A regular index (e.g., "C") exists on a field in a file.
     - A ^DIC lookup is performed on that file, with DIC(0)="QEM".
     - The lookup value in X partially matches no entries in the "B" index,
       but partially matches at least 6 entries in an index that collates 
       after "B".
     - At the CHOOSE 1-n: prompt, the user enters a ?.
  
   Result: <UNDEFINED>SEARCH+5^DIC3 *DINDEX(1,"LENGTH")
  
 Issue #2
 --------
 FIND^DIC and $$FIND1^DIC do not find entries when (1) the length of the
 lookup value is greater than the maximum length of the subscript that
 stores the indexed value, and (2) the lookup value contains only numbers
 and punctuation.
 (Routine: DICF1)
  
 Issue #3
 --------
 If a DD-type ^DIR call is made on a pointer field, or pointer-type ^DIR 
 read is made, and the user enters a value that partially matches several 
 entries in the pointed-to file, the user is presented with a list and a 
 "CHOOSE 1-n:" prompt. If the user enters an up-arrow (^) at the "CHOOSE 
 1-n:" prompt, and the pointed-to file contains more than 10 entries, ^DIR 
 displays help and the "Do you want the entire file_name List?" This help 
 and extra prompt are unnecessary.

 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
 ** Although queuing of this patch is allowed, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
 that ALL Users be off the system and VISTA Background jobs be STOPPED
 before this patch is installed. TaskMan should be stopped or placed in
 a wait state. Failure to do so may result in 'source routine edited'
 errors during a database update. Edits may be lost and records may be
 left in an inconsistent state. An error that occurs before a cross-
 reference is executed, for example, may lead to corrupted data or hard
 errors in the future. **
  
 Also, please make sure that no other patches are installed until
 installation for this patch has completed.
  
 The following installation instructions are based upon the premise 
 that the installer has heeded the above warning.
  
 Installation should take less than a minute.
  
   1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. 
      This option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
      Answer 'Yes' to run the Environment Check routine.
 
      Build DI*22.0*170 has an Environmental Check Routine
      Want to RUN the Environment Check Routine? YES//
 
   2. The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your 
      system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
      following options:
  
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global
         Backup a Transport Global
  
   4. In accordance with the warning at the beginning of the 
      installation instructions, make sure ALL interactive processes, and 
      ALL non-interactive background jobs are stopped following your site 
      specific procedures. TaskMan should be stopped or placed in a wait state.
      All users should be off the system. NOT performing this step could result
      in 'source routine edited' error during database updates, and records may
      be left in an inconsistent state.
  
   5. On the KIDS menu, in the 'Installation' menu, use the following option:
  
           Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
           Select INSTALL NAME: DI*22.0*170
