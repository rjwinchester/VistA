 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 None
  
  
 Backout and Rollback Procedure:
 -------------------------------
 During the VistA Installation Procedure of the KIDS build, the 
 installer should back up the modified routines by the use of the
 'Backup a Transport Global' action (step 3a in the Installations 
 Instructions below).
  
 If rollback/backout is required, the installer can use the MailMan
 message to restore the routines to previous state. 
  
 To backout the ENTITY (#1.5) file and DDE EDIT ENTITY input template, use 
 the EN^DIU2 API. Caution should be taken when using this API. For more 
 information on usage of this API see FileMan 22.2 Developer Guide. The
 following is an example execution to remove files and input template:
  
 S DIU=1.5,DIU(0)="DT" D EN^DIU2
  
 To rollback/backout DDE options exported with this patch, may be disabled
 by using VA FileMan to assign an Out of Order message as follows:
  
 VA FileMan 22.2
  
  
 Select OPTION: 1  ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES
  
  
 Input to what File: OPTION//              (11330 entries)
