Description:
============

 Patch DI*22.2*5 will repair ten (10) VA FileMan 22.2 defects: 
   1. When calling ^DIR for a BOOLEAN-type field, the field LABEL appears 
      as a prompt.
   2. The VERIFY FIELDS option overruns the specified page length.
   3. An error is generated when selecting and deselecting a CAPTION-ONLY
      field in the ScreenMan Form Editor (<UNDEFINED>END+5^DDGF2 *L).
   4. After selecting and deselecting a field, the ScreenMan Form Editor
      may move the field when quitting without saving changes.
   5. The help text for the UNIVERSAL TIME data type causes ScreenMan to 
      scroll off the top of the terminal.
   6. The response to '?' and '??' for a UNIVERSAL TIME data type field
      repeats itself.
   7. The help for a YEAR data type field displays the DATE/TIME help text
      instead of the specific help for the YEAR data type.
   8. DD changes to display messages in the Input Transform using EN^DDIOL
      are not being displayed.
   9. Scrolling in a repeating block stops working and causes visual
      glitches if returned to after saving a record using a different page 
      through branching logic.
  10. When adding a field in the ScreenMan Form Editor, the user has to 
      enter <PF1>E in order to proceed to the Field Properties form. The
      current menu options of Close or Refresh do not allow the user to
      proceed to the Field Properties form.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. Ticket N/A
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When calling ^DIR with a file and field, the default prompt is the field 
 LABEL. This does not happen currently for the BOOLEAN data type, instead
 it gives the prompt "Enter response:".
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 A change to ^DIR2 fixes this problem so that a BOOLEAN data type behaves 
 like other data types when displaying the default prompt, basing it on the
 value of the LABEL field.
  
  
 2. Ticket #I8089470FY16
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The output from the VERIFY FIELDS option overruns the specified page 
 length.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Changes to ^DIV and ^DIVR correct this problem so that VERIFY FIELDS 
 adheres to the specified page length (screen depth) for all its output.
  
  
 3. Ticket #I7378770FY16
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An <UNDEFINED> error is generated when selecting and deselecting a 
 CAPTION-ONLY field in the ScreenMan Form Editor. The error occurs at
 <UNDEFINED>END+5^DDGF2, when the variable 'L' is undefined.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 A change to ^DDGF2 corrects the problem, allowing a CAPTION-ONLY field to 
 be selected and then deselected in the ScreenMan Form Editor.
  
  
 4. Ticket #I12524956FY17
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Selecting and deselecting a field in a block not aligned in Row 1 (R1),
 Column 1 (C1) causes that field to move within the block when quitting
 without saving changes.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changes to ^DDGF2 corrects the behavior so that selecting a field then
 quitting without saving will not move the field.
  
  
 5. Ticket N/A
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The help prompt for the UNIVERSAL TIME data type causes ScreenMan to
 scroll off the top of the terminal.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A change to the XECUTABLE HELP for the UNIVERSAL TIME data type
 corrects this problem.
  
  
 6. Ticket N/A
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The response to '?' and '??' for a UNIVERSAL TIME data type field
 repeats itself.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A change to ^DIEQ corrects the behavior so that the help text does not
 repeat.
  
  
 7. Ticket N/A
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The help for a YEAR data type field displays the DATE/TIME help text
 instead of the specific help for the YEAR data type.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A change to ^DIEQ corrects the behavior so that the YEAR help text
 is correctly displayed.
  
  
 8. Ticket  #I13081432FY17
  
 Problem:
 --------
 DD Changes to display messages in the Input Transform using EN^DDIOL
 are not being displayed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A change to ^DICN corrects this behavior so that messages written in
 an Input Transform are displayed correctly.
  
  
 9. Ticket N/A
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Scrolling in a repeating block stops working and causes visual
 glitches if returned to after saving a record using a different page
 through branching logic.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changes to ^DDS1 and ^DDS41 correct this problem.
  
  
 10. Ticket N/A
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When adding a field in the ScreenMan Form Editor, the user has to enter
 <PF1>E in order to proceed to the Field Properties form. The current
 menu options of Close or Refresh do not allow the user to proceed to
 the Field Properties form.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changes to ^DDS, ^DDSCOM and ^DDSSTK correct this problem.
