Description:
============

 The Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 Evolution program to modernize VistA includes modernizing Veterans Affairs
 (VA's) enterprise data management capabilities.  Modernizing FileMan will
 functionally standardize VistA's database.  This will enable structured 
 data query and exchange across all VistA instances, creating an enterprise
 view of VistA data in standardized, computable form.  This modernized
 FileMan is called FileMan Enterprise for its enterprise data management
 capabilities.
  
 This specific patch contains new datatypes for FileMan 22.2 as well as
 enhancements to the FileMan Meta Data Dictionary.
  
 1.  This build introduces the following new data types:
  
     a. BOOLEAN: A version of the SET data type with only two entry
        choices - TRUE or FALSE.
  
     b. MUMPS LABEL: A version of the FREETEXT data type that allows
        the storage of a tag and routine entry of the format, TAG^ROUTINE.
  
     c. TIME: Allows the input of date/time entries but will only store
        the TIME portion of the user input.
  
     d. YEAR: Allows the input of date/time entries but will only store
        the YEAR portion of the user input.
  
     e. FT DATE: Similar to the DATE/TIME DATA TYPE but internally stores
        the free text that was inputted by the user to determine the date.
  
     f. FT POINTER: Similar to the POINTER data type but internally stores
        the external value of the pointed to field.
  
     g. UNIVERSAL TIME: Allows the input of date/time entries and stores
        the Greenwich Mean Time in normal date/time format but also 
        includes the offset from the current timezone.
  
     h. RATIO: Accept two numbers with a colon (":") between the two 
        numbers.  It is formatted and stored like a mathematical ratio.  
        When defining a field with a DATA TYPE of RATIO the user will be
        asked for the minimum and maximum of each number in the ratio.
  
 2.  A new FileMan API (UTC^DIUTC) was created that allows the conversion
     of an internal FileMan date/time into Greenwich Mean Time and offset.
     The API needs to know the location, which is done by passing the 
     Country and Timezone as input parameters, passing an Institution as 
     a parameter (which has country and timezone fields defined), or
     using the Institution derived by the default Institution setup for the
     user.
  
 3.  The FileMan Meta Data Dictionary provides each site's specification
     of the FileMan files, the associated FileMan fields within each of 
     those files, and descriptive metadata about the site data for each
     individual VistA instance.  This patch adds functionality to do
     partial updates (deltas) to the Meta Data Dictionary.

 Backout and Rollback Procedure:
 -------------------------------
 The rollback plan for VistA applications is complex and not able to be
 a 'one size fits all' solution. The general strategy for VistA rollback
 is to repair the code with a follow-on patch. The development team
 recommends that sites log a CA Service Desk Manager (SDM) ticket if a
 patch needs to be backed-out.
   
 During the VistA Installation Procedure of the KIDS build, the installer
 should back up the modified routines by the use of the 'Backup a
 Transport Global' action (step 3a in the Installations Instructions
 below). The installer can restore the routines using the MailMan message
 that were saved prior to installing the patch. The backout procedure for
 data dictionary, options, forms, template, and data loads is more
 complex and may require the issuance of a follow-on patch to ensure all
 components are properly removed. Note that all rollback of all software
 components, including routines  must be restored to their previous state
 at the same time and in conjunction with restoration of the data.
   
  
 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 There is a post-install routine DINIT220 that will create the DATA TYPE
 (#.81), DATA TYPE PROPERTY (#.86), and DATA TYPE METHODS (#.87) files.  
 This post-install should not be deleted.
                                                                   
 There are two manual steps that should be run at the end of the
 installation. Please see the Post-Installation Instructions for additional
 information.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 There are no specific options and protocols to disable.
  
 This patch should not be queued for installation as there are 
 post-installation steps that need to be taken.
  
 TaskMan does not have to be stopped, HL7 filers do not need to be stopped,
 and users may be on the system.  The patch should be installed during
 non-peak hours to minimize potential for disruption to users.
  
 Also, please make sure that no other patches are installed until
 installation for this patch has completed.
  
 Installation will take approximately 5 minutes.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter DI*22.2*2.
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as Data Dictionaries (DDs) or
         templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter DI*22.2*2.
  
 5.  When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//" respond NO.
  
 6.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//" respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//" respond NO. 
  
 8.  If prompted "Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//" respond 0.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
  
 1) In order to update the META DATA DICTIONARY File, run the UPDATE THE 
    META DATA DICTIONARY [DDU UPDATE META DD] option, which is located on
    the DATA DICTIONARY UTILITIES [DI DDU] menu of VA FileMan [DIUSER].
  
    Here is an abbreviated example of what to expect when you run this 
    option. There will be approximately 100 rows of dots, and it should
    take less than one minute to complete.
    
    SINCE NO FILE IS IN APPLICATION GROUP 'DDD',
    the entire FileMan database will be scanned, and
    a Central Data Dictionary will now be compiled.
    OK? No// YES...........................................................
    .......................................................................
    .......................................................................
    <DONE>
  
   
 2) Update INSTITUTION file for the local sites:
    
    In order for the new UNIVERSAL TIME datatype to function properly, the 
    institutions used by the current system will need to have the 
    LOCATION TIMEZONE (#800) and COUNTRY (#801) fields and possibly the
    TIMEZONE EXCEPTION (#802) field of the INSTITUTION (#4) file populated.
    These fields will be populated by the Institution Master File update
    process. The temporary local solution will be to update the 
    INSTITUTION (#4) file, for the main local VAMC facility only, until the
    Master File process is modified to update these fields from the Central
    Server.
  
    You will need to know the timezone, country and if there is a daylight
    saving time exception. For example Arizona is in the Mountain Timezone
    but for most of the state it does not observe daylight saving time and
    local time stays at UTC-7.
   
    Most sites will be able to skip editing the TIMEZONE EXCEPTION field
    and will only need to edit fields LOCATION TIMEZONE (#800) and
    COUNTRY (#801) fields.
    
    If the facility is in one of the TIMZONE EXCEPTION areas: Arizona
    (outside the Navajo Nation), Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands,
    American Samoa, Guam and Northern Mariana Islands, then you will also
    edit TIMEZONE EXCEPTION (#802) field. For this field you will enter
    a 0 (zero).
   
    1) Determine timezone, country and if the facility/institution is in an
       area that has a timezone exception.
   
    2) From the programmer prompt get into FileMan and at the
       "Select INSTITUTION NAME:" prompt you will put in your institution's
       name or site number.
