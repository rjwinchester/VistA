 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1.  Ticket:   I12133765FY17
  Problem:
   Sort templates don't show previous values when editing the template
  Resolution:
   Change DIP1 to display previous value
  
 2.  Ticket:   I10027710FY16
  Problem:
   Date utility, %DT, allows incorrect time.  Calling %DT with X=3160707.8
   should return Y=-1
  Resolution:
   Change DIDT to return Y=-1 if X contains an incorrect time. Post install
   routine DI14POST will resave DIDT as %DT.
  
 3.  Ticket:   R13378947FY17
  Problem:
   Can't print OLD VALUE (#2) and NEW VALUE (#3) fields from AUDIT (#1.1) file
  Resolution:
   Change the logic in the computed fields #2 and #3.  Replace If statement
   with $Select.  Also, change DINIT20, which sets the logic when FileMan
   is initialized.
  
 4.  Ticket:   INC3327007
  Problem:
   Add APPLICATION GROUP to Data Dictionary List File Attributes option
  Resolution:
   Change DIDH1 to display APPLICATION GROUP
  
 5.  Ticket:   INC1570061
  Problem:
   Maximum length of new style cross reference is too short
  Resolution:
   Change MAXIMUM LENGTH (#6) field in INDEX (#.11) file from 240 to 999.
   Add change to DI14POST and DINIT2A4
  
 6.  Ticket:   INC1550303
  Problem:
   Undefined error when doing an Inquire to a file that has a computed field
   that calls EN^DIQ1
  Resolution:
   Change DIQ1 to new the variables C and DI at tag EN
  
 7.  Ticket:   I16938507FY18
  Problem:
   The variable DISYS is undefined when calling EN^DIEZ in background
  Resolution:
   Move the call to DT^DICRW to earlier in the routine.  It sets DISYS.
  
 8.  Ticket:   I17087603FY18
  Problem:
   When a partial Data Dictionary containing a multiple is distributed using
   KIDS, the zero node of sub dictionary has the wrong first piece
  Resolution:
   Change DIFROMS2; comment out line that was setting the sub dictionary zero
   node incorrectly to fix the bug.  Post Install EN^DI14POST will check and
   correct any corrupted sub dictionaries.
  
 9.  Ticket:   INC0105488
  Problem:
   Queries for data that utilizes a variable pointer field could be missing
   results
  Resolution:
   Change to DICOMP0 to handle variable pointers correctly
  
 10.  Ticket:   I16902120FY18
  Problem:
   If the variable %DT(0) is defined when an Input Transform is executed,
   it causes incorrect information
  Resolution:
   Change DICN to new the variable before executing the Input Transform
  
 11.  Ticket:   I17417683FY18, I10449501FY16
  Problem:
   Audit is not recording changes if it happens during a trigger to another
   file
  Resolution:
   The problem is the DA variable is changed.  Change DICR to save the DA
   array and other variables before auditing and then restore the variables
  
 12.  Ticket:   R15604177FY17
  Problem:
   If the records being transferred is in a file that contain a multiple field
   that uses DINUM in the Input Transform, then FileMan stacks the DA array,
   but never unstacks it when it tries to delete the record
  Resolution:
   Change DIT0 to reset DA to the correct record before deleting

 Patch Installation:
    
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch can be queued for installation.  TaskMan does not have to be
 stopped, Health Level 7 (HL7) filers do not need to be stopped, and
 users may be on the system.  The patch should be installed during
 non-peak hours to minimize potential for disruption to users.  This
 patch should take less than 1 minute to install.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 1. Choose the MailMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
    the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
    following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter
    DI*22.2*14.
  a. Print Transport Global - This option lets you print the contents
     of a Transport Global that is currently loaded in the ^XTMP
     global.
  b. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
     message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
     backup any other changes such as functions.
  c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
     allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
     is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
     (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
  d. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
     you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
     transport global.
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option
    and when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter DI*22.2*14.
  
 5. If prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
    Install? NO//' respond NO.
  
 7. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
    NO//" respond NO.
  
 8. If prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
    and Protocols? NO//" respond NO. 
  
 9. If prompted "Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//" respond 0.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 You need to run D EN^DI14POST to check for bad nodes on multiples. This
 is issue #8.  The routine will find all bad nodes and prompt you to fix
 them.  The results will be kept in the ^XTMP("DI14") global for 30 days,
 unless you run the report again, and can be reversed by using the 
 RESTORE^DI14POST call.
  
  
  TST>D EN^DI14POST
  
  This will check your account for bad ^DD(file #,0) nodes.  It will look
  for multiples that don't have the field name as the 1st piece of the node.
  It will display its results and ask you if you want to make the changes.
  This will take 5 to 10 minutes.
  
  You already have bad nodes identified in the ^XTMP("DI14") global.
  If you proceed this data will be overwritten.
  
  Do you want to run the check?
  Enter Yes or No: NO// YES
  ..
  
  DD(100.008,0)
  DD(8989.41,0)
  
  2 bad node(s) found.  Do you want to repair?
  Enter Yes or No: NO// YES
  
  Done
  
  TST>
   
   
   
 Backout and Rollback Procedure:
 -------------------------------
 This patch consists of routines and a fix to the AUDIT file. During the VistA
 Installation Procedure of the KIDS build, the installer should back up the
 modified routines by the use of the 'Backup a Transport Global' action
 (step 3b in the Installations Instructions above).
  
 If rollback/backout is required, the installer can restore the routines
 using the MailMan message that were saved prior to installing the
 patch.  The changes to the two fields in the AUDIT file can remain.
