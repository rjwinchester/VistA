Associated patches: (v)DI*22.2*5   <<= must be installed BEFORE `DI*22.2*13'

Subject: FIXES TO VA FILEMAN 22.2

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch DI*22.2*13 will repair five (5) VA FileMan 22.2 defects:
   1. FT Pointer Help Text does not display with first request, it only 
      displays every other time.
   2. ScreenMan display is messed up in Screen Mode when adding one of the 
      new Data Types with additional prompts.
   3. LAYGO FT POINTER saves new entry even if user says No.
   4. When using the screen-mode version of Modify File Attributes 
      [DIMODIFY], the Command Area has an erroneous default value of EXIT.
      This may trigger an <UNDEFINED> error when attempting to exit the
      form if the field has not been fully defined.
   5. Incomplete data dictionary when defining a multiple FT POINTER field.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
   
 1. Ticket N/A
   
 Problem:
 --------
 When entering "?" or "??" to see the help text for FT Pointer field, help 
 text does not display for the first time. User has to try for the second 
 time so see the help text.
   
 Resolution:
 ----------
 A change to DIETLIBF corrects this problem so the help text for a FT
 POINTER field is always displays in response to a "?" or "??" request.
   
   
 2. Ticket N/A
   
 Problem:
 --------
 Adding a field using Screen Mode selecting any new Data Type which has
 multiple prompts would mess up the ScreenMan display and cause the Command
 Area to scroll to the top.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A change to DICATTUD corrects this problem and keeps the Command Area 
 from scrolling up into the area of the screen occupied by the ScreenMan 
 display.
   
   
 3. Ticket #I13400572FY17
   
 Problem:
 --------
 A FT POINTER is defined as a multiple and LAYGO permission is set to yes. 
 The user is prompted if they want to add to the pointer to file. If the 
 user enters 'No', the record is still added to the pointed to file.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A change to DICN corrects this problem so that LAYGO with the FT POINTER 
 Data Type acts correctly and doesn't add a record to the pointed to file 
 if the user enters 'No' when prompted.
   
   
 4. Ticket #I15684970FY17
   
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the screen-mode version of Modify File Attributes [DIMODIFY],
 the Command Area has an erroneous default value of EXIT. This may trigger
 an <UNDEFINED> error when attempting to exit the form if the field has not
 been fully defined.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A change to DDSCOM removes the default value of EXIT from the Command 
 Area. Changes to DICATTDM prevent the <UNDEFINED> error from occurring.
  
   
 5. Ticket N/A
   
 Problem:
 --------
 When defining a field in FileMan to be a FT POINTER and saying yes to the 
 option to make it a multiple, the data dictionary is left incomplete and 
 the field cannot be used.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changes to DICATTDE and DICATT22 corrects this problem so that a multiple 
 FT POINTER field behaves properly after it is added to a File.
