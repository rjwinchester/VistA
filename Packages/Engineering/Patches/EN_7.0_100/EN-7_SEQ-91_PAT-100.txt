Subject: ENGINEERING SUPPORT FOR RTLS

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is implementing an integrated, 
 enterprise-wide solution for a Real Time Location System (RTLS) for VA. 
 The RTLS will be used for the purpose of tracking equipment, supplies, 
 and instruments. This patch provides support for the interface between 
 VistA Engineering files EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) and ENG SPACE (#6928).
  
 Specifically, the VistA Engineering files EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) and ENG 
 SPACE (#6928) will be tracked on a limited number of fields and any data 
 changes detected will be sent to RTLS to keep its database up to date.
  
 The data dictionary changes introduced by this patch are invisible to the
 Engineering users. Therefore, there are no changes in functionality for
 the menus available to the users of the package. For a complete list of
 the fields affected by this patch, see the section 'Patch Components' 
 in this document. Notice that this patch must be installed after the
 companion patch VIAA*1.0*3.
  
 PLEASE NOTE:  Upon National Release, all facilities must install
 both RTLS Asset Tracking (AT) patches (VIAA*1.0*3 and EN*7.0*100)
 in their local production environments, regardless of whether RTLS AT
 will be implemented locally. This process is separate from and not to be 
 confused with activation of these patches.
  Those facilities that will not be using RTLS AT will leave the patches 
 installed in their production environments but will not activate them.
  Those facilities that will be using RTLS AT will be contacted after 
 installation and later on in 2018 by their RTLS vendor. At that time,
 additional instructions regarding software activation and use will be
 provided.
  
  
 New Functionality Exported by This Patch:
 ----------------------------------------- 
  
 a)  New MUMPS cross-references on multiple fields to track data changes
 in the Engineering files EQUIPMENT INV. (#6914) and ENG SPACE (#6928). The
 fields PHYSICAL INVENTORY DATE (#23) and LOCATION (#24) in file #6914 are
 not set with any new MUMPS cross-references but they will be updated by
 RTLS when a piece equipment is moved to a new location. Additionally, the
 descriptions of these two fields in the data dictionary will be extended
 to reflect the update by RTLS.
  
 b)  This patch also sets the flag 'NOREINDEX' in all the fields in the  
 EQUIPMENT INV. file (#6914) and ENG SPACE file (#6928) that are modified
 with a MUMPS cross-reference to send changes to RTLS. The new flag
 prevents the reindexing of the files if there is an attempt to reindex
 the fields tracked by RTLS.
