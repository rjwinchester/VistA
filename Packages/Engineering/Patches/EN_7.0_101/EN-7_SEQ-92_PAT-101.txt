 1. I9857246FY16 - Days Between Returns Field
   
    Problem:
    --------
    There is a need to generate an Equipment Return Date 365 days in the
    future. The current maximum is 90. The Equipment return date is
    calculated by using the PHYSICAL INVENTORY DATE field (#23) of the 
    EQUIPMENT INV. file (#6914) plus the number of days entered in DAYS 
    BETWEEN RETURNS field (#30) of the CMR file (#6914.1) or the default
    of 90 DAYS if no value is entered in DAYS BETWEEN RETURNS field (#30).
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The problem occurs because of the "Input Transform" for DAYS 
    BETWEEN RETURNS field (#30) in the CMR file (#6914.1) currently does
    not allow a value greater than 90. Change the input transform to allow
    a value up to 365 inclusive.
