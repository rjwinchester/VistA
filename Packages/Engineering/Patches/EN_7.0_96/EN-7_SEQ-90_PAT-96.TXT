 1. INC000000824854 Engineering - Other: New IT BOCs
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The VHA CFO Office of Financial Oversight-Austin has requested a patch
  to add 1 new NX BOC CAPITALIZED BUDGET OBJECT CODE and deactivate 3 old 
  NX BOC CAPITALIZED BUDGET OBJECT CODEs in the NX BOC file (#6914.4). 
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  A post init routine EN70P96 was created to update these following codes
  in the NX BOC file (#6914.4).
  
  BOC   BOC Title                                     SGL   Deactivate Date

 2. INC000000997105 Engineering - Other
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The subscript error is usually caused when site users try to do a barcode 
  upload and there is no nonexpendable inventory data except the barcode
  program id in the particular upload process.
   
  Resolution:
  -----------
  The software was modified to display the message 'No data to process.' if
  there is no nonexpendable inventory data uploaded from the portable bar
  code reader to the BARCODE PROGRAM FILE (#446.4).
  
  Routine: ENEQNX1
  
 3. INC000001011647 Engineering - Work Order Issue
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Site user received this error: <NOTOPEN>^PRT1^ENWOD in the Multiple Work
  Order Entry [ENWOMULTI] option when he tried to print multiple work
  orders on a device being queued in a task.
   
  Resolution:
  -----------
  The software was modified to not close the device by the close logic for
  devices (%ZISC) when the job for printing multiple work orders is queued
  in a task and the device is eventually closed in Taskman.
  
  Routine: ENWOD
