 Ticket Overview:
 ================
  
 I7154779FY16 - Incorrect Service Position on Itemized Shift Report
  
 Problem:
 -------
  
 If a nurse has changed service positions (for example: from Licensed 
 Practical Nurse to Registered Nurse), the former service position might
 be listed on the Intake/Output 24 Hours Itemized Shift Report.  This issue
 will occur when the previous service position for a nurse is filed at a
 lower internal entry number (IEN) than the current service position's IEN
 in the NURSE POSITION CONTROL (#211.8) file.
  
 Resolution: 
 ----------
  
 Modify routines GMRYSE1 and GMRYSE3 to list the service position held by 
 the nurse at the time the intake/output entry was logged for the patient.
     
 Routines: GMRYSE1 and GMRYSE3
