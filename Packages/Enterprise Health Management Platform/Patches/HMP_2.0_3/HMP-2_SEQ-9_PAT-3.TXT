 New Service Requests (NSRs):
 ----------------------------
 NSR #20150408 - VistA Evolution Enterprise Health Management Platform 
 (eHMP)
  
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 -----------------------------
 There are no Patient Safety Issues.
  
  
 Remedy Tickets(s) & Overview:
 -----------------------------
 1.  I12161569FY17 - DE7372 - Loss of Resource slots creates a stuck Queue 
 for Patient Sync but not freshness updates
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When attempting to sync a new patient, the process errored out twice.  
 This occurred in the San Antonio production environment.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Utilities were added to allow eHMP to monitor resource usage and in the 
 situation where resources have been used up and the jobs connected to 
 those resources are no longer active, the ability to reset resource 
 status to what it actually is, has been added.
  
 2.  I1232316FY17 DE7401 - VistA Production queues stuck, with no VistA 
 error, and full resources available
  
 Problem:
 --------
 This incident is tracking the work being done on DE7401.  VistA 
 Production queues were getting stuck with no errors and full resources 
 available
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 It was determined that the throttling code, which prevents the eHMP 
 system from using too many resources on a VistA system, would activate 
 properly, however the restart code when resources became available was 
 not always restarting. This code was modified to ensure the eHMP system 
 would begin sync processes when resources were available.
  
 3.  I13581054FY17 - DE5111 ERROR MESSAGE: <UNDEFINED>GET+8^ORQ12 - MIN 
     I13580684FY17      prod 4/5 and 4/6
     I12324386FY17
     I12230643FY17
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An error was generated when trying to retrieve child orders that had been 
 deleted.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The eHMP code was modified to check for the existence of orders before 
 calling the API in the routine ORQ12.
  
 4.  I13438824FY17 DE7799 - Fix issue with the sync process getting into 
 an infinite loop
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The infinite loop process was caused by a composite variable (HMPID) used 
 to look up a record in BCMA when a single variable was needed. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The code in the HMPDJ0 needed to be modified to make the variable used in 
 GET1^DIQ Call to use the variable +HMPID.  HMPID is the IEN of the record 
 for the look up.  If the variable is not all numeric (has alpha 
 characters at the end), it is not a valid IEN.  Changing the code to use 
 the + at the front of the variable strips any trailing alpha characters.
  
 Also, there was a need to change from using the TMP global to using the 
 XTMP global when setting the lock to prevent more than one process from 
 running at a time in API^HMPDJFS.
  
 5.  I12323167FY17 DE7401 - VistA Production queues stuck, with no VistA 
 error, and full resources available
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The existing throttling code is designed to prevent the eHMP freshness 
 and sync processes from overwhelming the XTMP size restraints and from 
 using too many resources on the VistA system. When a system slow down 
 occurs and the throttling kicks in, under certain circumstances the 
 throttling would not turn off when system resources and size constraints 
 returned to operating levels. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The problem was the software scanning to detect system resources could 
 also become stuck when throttling kicked in. Several locations were added 
 in the code to ensure the resource scanning would not stop when 
 throttling turned on.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ------------------------ 
 Sites may retrieve the documentation from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
 directory at one of the OI Field Offices. The preferred method is to
 retrieve the file using Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from
 DOWNLOAD.VISTA.DOMAIN.EXT, which will transmit the file from the first
 available server. Alternatively, sites may elect to retrieve the file from
 a specific OI Field Office.

 Installation Verification
 =========================
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;2.0;ENTERPRISE HEALTH MANAGEMENT PLATFORM;**[Patch List]**;Sep 01, 
 2011;Build 26
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
 Back-out Procedures
 ===================
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel. 
 Rollback of Data or Data Dictionary changes should be coordinated with 
 the development team eHMPSystemOperations@domain.ext.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System. VA FileMan will also be utilized to remove
 the HMP protocols from other package protocols that were added during
 installation.
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 =================================
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the HMP Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 HMP*2.0*3 patch have been rolled back the first two lines of the routines
 will no longer contain the designation of patch 3 in the patch list 
 section on line 2.
