Subject: EARLY ADOPTER RELEASE OF eHMP USER INTERFACE (UI) V1.2.5

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 WARNING: This is an Early Adopter version of Health Management Platform 
 (eHMP) User Interface (UI) version 1.2.5. Only vetted users that have
 completed the eHMP 1.2 training should be given access to eHMP User
 Interface (UI) at this time. 
  
 ***Note*** 
 eHMP technical support staff have installed this foundational release on 
 the eHMP servers at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) as 
 part of eHMP 1.2 Initial Operating Capability (IOC) testing. On August 31,
 2016 it was approved for National release to an expanded set of approved
 users across the enterprise.
   
 This controlled release is scheduled to take place beginning in September 
 2016. It will be rolled out incrementally, in order to evaluate system
 impact as users are added. Exact schedule is to be announced via email and
 through the weekly EA Deployment Touchpoint call. All 130 health care
 VistA sites have previously installed HMP*2.0 and the associated VistA
 patches used to establish connectivity to eHMP servers at AITC.
  
 Only vetted users that have completed the eHMP 1.2 training should be 
 provided access to the UI. Vetted users must be assigned the HMP UI
 CONTEXT version 20160108-01.us12195 [HMP UI CONTEXT] menu option. Users
 are vetted through the National Data System (NDS), based on the list
 submitted by the sites to VHA eHMP Access Request Team 
 (VHAeHMPAccessRequest@domain.ext). This early adopter release of eHMP is not
 yet meant for authoritative clinical use or clinical decision. It is being
 released for comparison and evaluation purposes only. End users are
 encouraged to explore eHMP as opportunities arise throughout their work
 day.
  
 **********************************************************************
 This web-based release provides the user interface necessary to view and 
 access the features within eHMP. The eHMP project is a multi-year effort 
 to evolve a modern, service-oriented platform which provides a web-based 
 user interface (UI), clinical data services (CDS), and assembles patient 
 clinical data from federated Veterans Health Information Systems and 
 Technology Architecture (VistA) repositories, Department of Defense (DoD),
 and private partner data sources, reflective of each location providing
 care to the patient. This federated data is aggregated into an enterprise
 patient record. eHMP service components will span all application layers,
 including presentation, business and core services, and data access.
  
 Release 1.2 is the first version for national release (albeit to a 
 limited audience). It introduces critical viewer edition enhancements to 
 provide new capabilities to the VA beyond what is available today via 
 CPRS, Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV), and VistAWeb. The system will provide 
 enhanced presentations of clinical data ranging from trend views that 
 provide a quick snapshot of easily understandable data, to detailed views 
 that provide the user with a full range of options for examining 
 longitudinal patient medical records. Users are able to configure these 
 views into a limitless number of custom workspaces in order to support a 
 variety of clinical workflows. There are also multiple pre-configured 
 workspaces available to the user, which are filtered for specific 
 conditions. The workspaces provide the appropriate clinical information 
 for a selected condition (e.g., COPD or diabetes). Other features include 
 the Military History applet, improved text search, and online application 
 help screens.
