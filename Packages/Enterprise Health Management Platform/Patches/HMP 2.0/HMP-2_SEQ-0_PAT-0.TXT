Description:
============

 ENTERPRISE HEALTH MANAGEMENT PLATFORM (eHMP)
  
 The eHMP project within the Veterans Health Information Systems and
 Technology (VistA) Evolution program will introduce expanded capabilities
 and modernize existing features of the VA VistA Electronic Health Record
 (EHR) system. The eHMP project is a multi-year effort to evolve a modern,
 service-oriented Enterprise Health Application Platform. This platform
 includes VistA Exchange, the eHMP graphical user interface (GUI), as well
 as clinical knowledge enrichment and decision support services. VistA
 Exchange is the clinical data services engine, federating clinical data
 from a variety of VA and DoD sources into an Enterprise Health Management
 Platform Patient Record. The eHMP framework will incorporate capabilities
 currently provided by Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) and Health Informatics
 Initiative (hi2) HMP. The eHMP will eventually replace the Computerized
 Patient Record System (CPRS) as VA's primary point of care application.
 The eHMP Viewer Edition version 1.2 is the initial product providing a
 user interface. This project is being deployed in phases with each
 iteration adding new features.
  
 ***Note***
 eHMP will be a phased implementation

 There are no routines in this patch.
  
 Forms Associated:
 -----------------
 There are no new or modified forms.
  
 Mail Groups Associated:
 -----------------------
 HMP IRM GROUP - This mail group will receive alerts from the 
 eHMP subscription process if the usage of global ^XTMP reaches the limit
 allowed and begins to pause subscriptions until disk space is available.
 The mail group also receives notifications when disk space is freed up
 and subscriptions are again proceeding. The eHMP software 
 automatically clears the ^XTMP data after it is processed.
  
 Options Associated:
 -------------------
 The following new options are associated with this release:
  
  - HMP Application Proxy [HMP APPLICATION PROXY] - This option allows the
    HMP connector proxy access to the VistA system.
  
  - Return List of Tomorrow's Patients [HMP APPOINTMENTS] - This option 
    should be scheduled to run nightly, to notify the Enterprise
    Health Management Platform (eHMP) of patients that are to be
    seen tomorrow.
  
  - XTMP Global Monitor [HMP MONITOR FOR XTMP GLOBAL] - This option will
    monitor amount of space in the ^XTMP global used by the eHMP.  The 
    amount used is very dynamic
  
  - Patient Appointments [HMP PATIENT ACTIVITY] - Return appointments for a
    subscribed patient. 
  
  - HMP Patient Data Monitor [HMP PATIENT DATA MONITOR] - This option
    manages the HMP Patient Data Monitor background job.  It first checks
    to see if the job is running, and will prompt the user to start it if
    it's stopped. It may also be used to stop the job, but the eHMP client
    may not display up-to-date data until it is started up again.
  
  - Synchronize the HMP [HMP SYNCHRONIZATION CONTEXT]- This option manages
    access to RPCs responsible for synchronization of eHMP data with VistA.
  
  - HMP UI Context Version 0.7-S62 [HMP UI CONTEXT] - This option allows
    the HMP UI access to the VistA system.
  
  - Writeback Of Domain Data To VistA [HMP WB DOMAINS] - Writes domain 
    data to VistA
  
  - HMP Writeback Patient Demographics [HMP WB PTDEM] - This option allows 
    eHMP to change patient phone numbers in VistA.
  
  - New Person events for HMP [HMP XU EVENTS] - This protocol will track
    New Person updates for HMP.
  
  - Manually Add Patient to HMP [HMPM ADD HMP PATIENT] - Use this option to
    manually add a patient for synchronization with the Enterprise Health
    Management Platform (eHMP).
  
  - Add Health Management Platform User [HMPM ADD HMP USER] - This option
    allows a user to be given access to use the Health Management Platform.
    The selected user will be given the HMP UI CONTEXT option.  
    Additionally, their default patient list may be set up for automatic
    synchronization with the Health Management Platform (HMP).
  
  - Emergency Stop HMP Freshness Updates [HMPM EMERGENCY STOP] - This
    option should be used with caution.  It will stop the freshness events
    for the ENTERPRISE HEALTH MANAGEMENT PLATFORM (HMP) from being called.
    Once the freshness events are stopped, patient data must be
    re-synchronized with the HMP to ensure completeness.  Only stop
    freshness updates if there is a problem with system operation.
  
  - Monitor HMP Server Synchronization [HMPM EXTRACT MONITOR] - This option
    is used to monitor the polls from an HMP server and any currently 
    executing HMP extracts.
  
  - Resume Freshness Updates That Have Been Stopped [HMPM RESTART
    FRESHNESS] - This option will remove the flags that cause freshness
    updates to be stopped.  It will likely be necessary to re-synchronized
    patients after freshness has been stopped, since updates will be
    missing from the time that freshness updates were not being received.
  
  - HMP Technical Management [HMPMGR] - This menu contains various options
    to help with the management of HMP
