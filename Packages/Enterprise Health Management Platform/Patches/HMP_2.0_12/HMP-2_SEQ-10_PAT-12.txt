 Back-out Procedures
 ===================
 Back-out procedures will be done only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the development team and appropriate VA site/region 
 personnel.  The decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint 
 decision between the development team, VA site/region personnel and other 
 appropriate VA personnel. If a determination is made at some point to 
 reactivate eHMP the specifics to accomplish this will be provided in a 
 new patch.
