 **********************************************************************
 BACKGROUND: 
   
 This controlled release began in September 2016. It will be rolled out
 incrementally in order to evaluate system impact as users are added. Exact
 schedule is to be announced via email and through the weekly EA Deployment
 Touchpoint call. All 130 health care VistA sites have previously installed
 HMP*2.0 and the associated VistA patches used to establish connectivity to
 eHMP servers at AITC.
  
 Only vetted users that have completed the eHMP 1.2 training should be 
 provided access to the UI. Vetted users must be assigned the HMP UI
 CONTEXT version 20160108-01.us12195 [HMP UI CONTEXT] menu option. Users
 are vetted through the National Data System (NDS), based on the list
 submitted by the sites to VHA eHMP Access Request Team 
 (VHAeHMPAccessRequest@domain.ext). This early adopter release of eHMP is not
 yet meant for authoritative clinical use or clinical decision. It is being
 released for comparison and evaluation purposes only. End users are
 encouraged to explore eHMP as opportunities arise throughout their work
 day.
  
 This web-based release provides the user interface necessary to view and 
 access the features within eHMP. The eHMP project is a multi-year effort 
 to evolve a modern, service-oriented platform which provides a web-based 
 user interface (UI), clinical data services (CDS), and assembles patient 
 clinical data from federated Veterans Health Information Systems and 
 Technology Architecture (VistA) repositories, Department of Defense (DoD),
 and private partner data sources, reflective of each location providing
 care to the patient. This federated data is aggregated into an enterprise
 patient record. eHMP service components will span all application layers,
 including presentation, business and core services, and data access.
  
 Release 1.2 is the first version for national release (albeit to a limited
 audience). It introduces critical viewer edition enhancements to provide
 new capabilities to the VA beyond what is available today via CPRS, Joint
 Legacy Viewer (JLV), and VistAWeb. The system will provide enhanced
 presentations of clinical data ranging from trend views that provide a
 quick snapshot of easily understandable data, to detailed views that
 provide the user with a full range of options for examining longitudinal
 patient medical records. Users are able to configure these views into a
 limitless number of custom workspaces in order to support a variety of
 clinical workflows. There are also multiple pre-configured workspaces
 available to the user, which are filtered for specific conditions. The
 workspaces provide the appropriate clinical information for a selected
 condition (e.g., COPD or diabetes). Other features include the Military
 History applet, improved text search, and online application help screens.
