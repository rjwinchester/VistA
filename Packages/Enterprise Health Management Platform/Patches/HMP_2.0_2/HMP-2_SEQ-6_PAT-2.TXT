Subject: eHMP WRITEBACK VERSION 1

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch introduces the new functionality of WriteBack which gives the 
 users the ability to enter orders, vitals, and other medical data into 
 VistA from the Enterprise Health Management Platform (eHMP) User Interface
 (UI). It also addresses several defects that have been identified outside
 of the HMP namespace. This patch is being released in conjunction with six
 (6) pre-requisite patches that add necessary triggers and functionality to
 the MC, OR, PSB, GMRV, PSS, and DG namespaces. HMP*2.0*2 also enhances
 several tools within VistA. The HMP Monitor has been enhanced to show more
 data in a clearer format and Error Trapping for the VistA-Sync process is
 more informative of the nature of problems that occur regarding patient
 sync and freshness updates. Enhancing the freshness stream updates will
 provide information for the support staff to assist the VA Medical Centers
 when necessary.
  
 **NOTE**
 HMP*2.0*2 is being released in a bundle with 6 supporting patches. It is 
 recommended that this bundle be installed during non-peak hours
 with no CPRS users on the system. This bundle should take less than 5
 minutes to install.
  
 The patches will be installed in the following order:
 1. DG*5.3*921
 2. MC*2.3*47
 3. GMRV*5*32
 4. PSB*3*95
 5. PSS*1*197
 6. OR*3*421
 7. HMP*2.0*2
  
 Following the installation of HMP*2.0*2, IRM staff should review the Error
 trap for any <NOROUTINE> errors and work with the assistance of the
 Clinical Application Coordinators (CACs) to validate the patient's orders
 placed during the install time.

 Installation Verification
 =========================
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;2.0;ENTERPRISE HEALTH MANAGEMENT PLATFORM;**[Patch List]**;Sep 01, 
 2011;Build 26
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
 Back-out Procedures
 ===================
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of ASM
 and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to back-out or
 rollback software will be a joint decision between ASM, VA site/region
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install).  The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded
 with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The
 Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the
 backed up routines onto the VistA System.
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 =================================
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the HMP Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 HMP*2.0*2 patch have been rolled back the first two lines of the routines
 will no longer contain the designation of patch 2 in the patch list 
 section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
