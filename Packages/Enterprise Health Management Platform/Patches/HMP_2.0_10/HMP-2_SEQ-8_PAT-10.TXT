Subject: EARLY ADOPTER RELEASE OF eHMP USER INTERFACE (UI) V1.2.8

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 WARNING: This is an Early Adopter version of Health Management Platform 
 (eHMP) User Interface (UI) version 1.2.8. Only vetted users that have
 completed the eHMP 1.2 training should be given access to eHMP User
 Interface (UI) at this time. 
  
 ***Note*** 
 eHMP technical support staff installed this release on the eHMP servers at
 the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) as part of eHMP 1.2
 Initial Operating Capability (IOC) testing. On June 2, 2017 it was
 approved for national release to an expanded set of approved users across
 the enterprise. The scheduled date for release is June 7, 2017.
  
 All 130 health care VistA sites have previously installed HMP*2.0 and the
 associated VistA patches used to establish connectivity to eHMP servers at
 AITC. This web-based release requires no installation at the VistAs or on
 local workstations.
  
 As previously, only vetted users that have completed the eHMP 1.2 training
 should be provided access to the user interface (UI). Vetted users must be
 assigned the HMP UI CONTEXT version 20160108-01.us12195 [HMP UI CONTEXT]
 menu option. Users are vetted through the National Data System (NDS),
 based on the list submitted by the sites to VHA eHMP Access Request Team
 (VHAeHMPAccessRequest@domain.ext). This early adopter release of eHMP is not
 yet meant for authoritative clinical use or clinical decision. It is being
 released for comparison and evaluation purposes only. End users are
 encouraged to explore eHMP as opportunities arise throughout their work
 day.
