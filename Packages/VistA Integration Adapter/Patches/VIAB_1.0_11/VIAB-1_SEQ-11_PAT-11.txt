Description:
============

 This EMERGENCY patch is required to allow BMS to migrate off of MDWS to 
 VIA per the White House Mandate and to remediate known security issues.
  
 NOTE: This patch creates new indexes on several files. 
 It is recommended this patch be installed after normal work hours.
  
 A new index, "AC" was created on the .01 field of the PATIENT MOVEMENT 
 FILE (#405).
  
 A new index, "AD" was added to the ENTERED ON field (#101) of the 
 PATIENT MOVEMENENT FILE (#405) for performance reasons.
  
 A new index, "BMS", was added to the DATE ENTERED INTO FILE field 
 (#.097) in the PATIENT FILE in order to improve the speed of the search.
  
 A new index "ADST" was added to TIME ENTERED INTO FILE (#1.4) of the
 ED LOG FILE (#230) to support sorting output based on this field.
  
 This patch corrects performance issues for the following targets within 
 the Bed Management System (BMS):
  
 1.  GetPatientMovement
 2.  ListAdmittedPatients
 3.  ListAdmittedPatientsForUpdate
 4.  ListClinicAppointments
 5.  ListHospitalLocation
 6.  ListOrders
 7.  ListOrderActions
 8.  ListPatient
 9.  ListPatientMovement
 10. ListPatientMovementByAdmission
  
 Modifications were made to the following targets to standardize the MORE
 field used for paging:
  
 1. ListPatientAppointment
 2. ListPatientMovementbyAdmission
 3. ListPatientMovement
 4. ListPatientAppointment
  
 The returned data was modified for the following targets to match 
 documentation from VIAB*1*8 patch:
  
 1. GetPatientMovement
 2. ListAdmittedPatients
 3. ListAdmittedPatientsForUpdate
 4. ListCancelOrders
 5. ListOrderActions
 6. ListPatient
 7. ListPatientAppointment
 8. ListPatientMovement
  
 Routine VIABMS and VIABMS1 were modified, and a new routine VIABMS2 was 
 added, to enhance this service.
  
 GETACTIVITY
 ===========
 This patch adds a new PATH 'GETACTIVITY' to the VIAB BMS RPC. Its purpose
 is to retrieve entries from the ED LOG (#230) file based on date range. 
 The output format is
  
 DISPOSITION TIME (#1.3) ^ PATIENT ID  (#.06) ^ FACILITY ID  (#.02) ^ 
 COMPLAINT  (#1.1) ^ DIAGNOSIS TIME (#1.4)
  
  
 EXCLUDE FROM FACILITY DIR
 =========================
 This patch also includes EXCLUDE FROM FACILITY DIR (#.109) in the output 
 of GETPATIENT and LISTPATIENT (entry points GETPAT and LSTPAT, 
 respectively).

 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
  
 NOTE:  This patch creates a new cross reference on the PATIENT FILE (#2). 
 It is recommended this patch be installed after normal work hours.
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system. This patch should 
 take approximately 30-60 minutes to install. The time to install will be 
 impacted by the number of records in the PATIENT FILE (#2) and the ORDER 
 (#100) file.
  
 No menu options need to be disabled.
    
 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------- 
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
    
  2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
    
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
      following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the 
      patch VIAB*1*11:
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
    
   4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
       choose the patch (VIAB*1*11) to install.
    
   5.  If prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of

       and Protocols? NO//', press <ENTER>.
  
   8.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0.
     
  Post-Installation Instructions:
  -------------------------------
  A post install routine, VIABPOST will run at the end of the 
  installation. This routine loops thru the files and creates the cross 
  references. This routine can be deleted after the install completes.
  
  NOTE:  Sites not currently using the clinical reminders index should 
  build the ORDERS index using the option PXRM INDEX MANAGEMENT.
  
 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------------
 Install the backup that you create during installation of the patches.  
 This will revert the VIABMS* routines back to the pre-install version. The
 patch also creates five new cross-references: "BMS" on field .097 of the
 PATIENT (#2) file, the "ADST" on field 1.3 of the ED LOG (#230) file, and
 the "AC" and "AD" cross-references on the PATIENT MOVEMENT (#405) file, 
 These cross-references may be deleted when backing out the patch.
