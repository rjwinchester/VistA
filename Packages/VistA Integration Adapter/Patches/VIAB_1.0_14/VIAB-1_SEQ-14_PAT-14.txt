Description:
============

 The VistA integration Adaptor (VIA) system is a middleware used to 
 transport clinical and non-clinical electronic information between
 producing and consuming applications in VA systems.  VIA utilizes remote
 procedure calls (RPCs) for data requested by consuming applications.
  
 This patch contains modifications for immunization functionality for the
 Customer Relationship Management (CRM) team. This patch also contains a 
 modification to the "LISTSCHEDULEDADMISSION" target of VIABMS, used by 
 the Bed Management System (BMS).
  
 The updates for this patch are:
  
 1. The semantics of SDATE (start date) and EDATE (end date) in the
 LISTSCHEDULEDADMISSION target of VIABMS (only) is modified as follows:
  
    * SDATE and EDATE are mandatory and represent date/time values, even if
      the date is exact.
    * The range returned is the inclusive range of times (not days) 
      between SDATE and EDATE. (Note that this is different from the
      behavior of some other targets of the same RPC.)
  
 2. VIAB GET IMMUNIZATION TYPE RPC entry in the REMOTE PROCEDURE 
 File (#8994) is populated with additional documentation information.
  
 3. Reconcile the VIAB WEB SERVICES OPTION option with the list of RPCs
 that VIA has permission to use with the ICRs that were approved.
