Description:
============

 The VistA integration Adaptor (VIA) system is a middleware used to transport
 clinical and non-clinical electronic information between producing and
 consuming applications in VA systems.  VIA utilizes remote procedure calls
 (RPCs) for data requested by consuming applications.
  
 The purpose of this patch is to publish RPCs that were added to the VIAB WEB
 SERVICES OPTION in the OPTION file (#19), RPC field (#320). 
  
 These new RPCs were created to meet the needs of consuming applications.
   VIAB ACTPROB   This RPC returns a list of active problems for a patient. 
   VIAB BMS       This RPC supports request for data from the Bed Management 
                  System (BMS). The input parameter 'PATH' determines the data
                  returned.
   VIAB CPTMODS   This RPC returns a list of CPT modifiers for a given CPT Code.
   VIAB CURSPE    This RPC returns the current observation status for a patient
                  based on the treating specialty.
   VIAB DEFAULT REQUEST REASON
                  This RPC returns a default reason for a consult service in 
                  the REQUEST SERVICES File #123.5.
   VIAB EDIT DEFAULT REASON
                  This RPC returns the value of RESTRICT DEFAULT REASON EDIT 
                  field.
   VIAB NOTEVSTR  This RPC returns VISIT LOCATION;EPISODE BEGIN DATE;VISIT TYPE
                  from the TIU DOCUMENT file.
   VIAB RADSRC    This RPC returns a list of active contract/sharing agreement
                  type.
 
 These 12 existing RPCs were added to VIAB WEB SERVICES OPTION.
