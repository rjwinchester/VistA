Subject: BMS LISTORDERS/LISTORDERACTIONS MODIFICATIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This EMERGENCY patch is required to allow Bed Management System (BMS) to
 migrate off of MDWS to VIA per the White House Mandate and to remediate
 known security issues.
  
 Changes include:
  
 1. The LISTORDERS and LISTORDERACTIONS target of the VIAB BMS RPC is
 being modified to sort by the DATE/TIME ORDERED field and use the "AF"
 cross reference on the ORDER file for lookup.
  
 2. The CURRENT ACTION field of the Order is the only ORDER ACTION
 sub-entry evaluated.
  
 3. DATE/TIME ORDERED sub-field of the ORDER ACTION sub-entry of the
 Order is the field value used between the evaluating BMS start and end
 times.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 1. INC3515187 - D/T Discharge Icons not showing on Dashboard
                   
 Problem:
 --------
 At times, "D" and "T" icons are not showing on the Bed Management System
 (BMS) Dashboard after a patient has a discharge or transfer order placed.
 It was determined that using the Clinical Reminders Index, with regards to
 the order start date, wasn't a datetime value all the time.  Rather, start
 date could be datetime, or, date only.  These, date only, values were not
 picked up by the Bed Management System (BMS) background queues when run.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The LISTORDERS and LISTORDERACTIONS target of the RPC is being modified to
 sort by DATE/TIME ORDERED and use the "AF" cross-reference on the ORDER
 file for lookup.
