Description:
============

 The VistA integration Adaptor (VIA) system is a middleware used to transport
 clinical and non-clinical electronic information between producing and
 consuming applications in VA systems.  VIA utilizes remote procedure calls
 (RPCs) for data requested by consuming applications.
 
 The purpose of this patch is to publish RPCs that were added to the VIAB WEB
 SERVICES OPTION in the OPTION file (#19), RPC field (#320) thus allowing VIA
 access to them. 
  
 This patch is one of a series of patches that will allow access for use by VIA: 
    OR*3*433
    TIU*1*306
    VIAB*1*7
 
 Three new RPCs were created to meet the needs of consuming applications.
    
    VIAB GETSURR   This RPC returns information about a user's surrogate,
                   including start/time and end date/time, if they are 
                   specified.
    
    VIAB GET USER DIVISIONS
                   This RPC provides divisional information on the DUZ that 
                   is passed in as the input parameter.
  
    VIAB SITENAME  This RPC will provide the Site Name to the calling
                   application, given the site ID or station number is 
                   passed in.
 
 VIA was granted access to ICR #2533 by Kernel to use the function DIV4^XUSER.
