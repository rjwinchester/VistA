Subject: UPDATES TO VIA FOR CRM

Category:

  - Routine

Description:
============

 This EMERGENCY patch is required to remediate known security issues and 
 maintain sustainment prior to a contract termination.
  
 The VistA Integration Adaptor (VIA) system is a middleware used to 
 transport clinical and non-clinical electronic information between
 producing and consuming applications in VA systems.  VIA utilizes remote
 procedure calls (RPCs) for data requested by consuming applications.
  
 This patch contains modifications for 'write notes' functionality for the 
 Customer Relationship Management (CRM) team.  
  
 The updates for this patch are:
  
 1. The new VIABPCE SAVE remote procedure call (RPC) was added to save
 progress note information in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).   
 The calling application passes progress note updates to VIA which parses, 
 formats, and calls the Patient Care Encounter (PCE) application program
 interface (API) DATA2PCE^PXAPI which ultimately stores the data.
  
 2. A post install routine VIAB12PO is included to add the new VIABPCE 
 SAVE RPC to the VIAB Web Services option [VIAB WEB SERVICES OPTION].
  
 3. The IMMTYPE target for VIAB GET IMMUNIZATION TYPE remote procedure call
 (RPC) was modified to return either a list of active immunizations or one
 or more immunizations by CVX code.
  
 4. The PX SAVE DATA RPC was removed from the VIAB Web Services option 
 [VIAB WEB SERVICES OPTION].
  
 5. A comment to add Integration Control Registration (ICR) 6904 was added
 to routine VIABPCE2.  No other changes were made to the routine.
  
 6. The following remote procedure calls were added to the VIAB WEB
 SERVICES [VIAB WEB SERVICES OPTION] option and there were no code changes 
 for these:
