Description:
============

 The VistA integration Adaptor (VIA) system is a middleware used to transport
 clinical and non-clinical electronic information between producing and
 consuming applications in VA systems.  VIA utilizes remote procedure calls
 (RPCs) for data requested by consuming applications.
  
 The purpose of this patch is to publish RPCs that were added to the VIAB WEB
 SERVICES OPTION in the OPTION file (#19), RPC field (#320). 
  
 Several new RPCs were created to meet the needs of consuming applications.

                       StartText^StartTime^Duration^FirstAdmin
  VIAB ALLSAMP      This RPC returns all collection samples in the format:
                   n^SampIEN^SampName^SpecPtr^TubeTop^^^LabCollect^^SpecName

  VIAB EFR          This RPC supports request for data from the Embedded 
                    Fragment Registry (EFR) project. Data is returned from 
                    RESEARCH File #67.1 and LAB DATA File #63.04.
