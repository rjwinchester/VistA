Description:
============

 The Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 Evolution program to modernize VistA includes modernizing Veterans Affairs
 (VA's) enterprise data management capabilities.  Modernizing VA FileMan
 will functionally standardize VistA's database.  This will enable
 structured data query and exchange across all VistA instances, creating
 an enterprise view of VistA data in standardized, computable form.  This
 modernized VA FileMan is called VA FileMan Enterprise for its enterprise
 data management capabilities.
  
 This patch, ETS*1.0*1, introduces new and modified routines and data
 dictionaries to implement Enterprise Terminology Services (ETS) package.
 The Enterprise Terminology Services package exists to provide 
 enterprise-wide access to common code sets that are needed in a health
 care system. It will contain VA FileMan files with the data and 
 Application Program Interfaces (APIs) that can be used to provide access
 and process the data. The Integration Control Registrations will be
 supported and thus open to all VistA applications.
  
 Specifically, patch ETS*1.0*1 contains the following:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 1. The following new files have been created in ETS to support the RxNorm
    code set in VistA. 
  
    a) The RXNORM CONCEPT NAMES AND SOURCES file (#129.2)
    b) The RXNORM SIMPLE CONCEPT AND ATOM ATTRIBUTES file (#129.21)
    c) The RXNORM RELATED CONCEPTS file (#129.22)
    d) The RXNORM SEMANTIC TYPES file (#129.23)
    e) The RXNORM SOURCE INFORMATION file (#129.24)
  
 2. The data for the above files will be populated. This will require
    approximately 516 megabytes of disk space and 11.2 gigabytes of journal
    space.
  
 3. The following new APIs were created to retrieve RxNorm data.
  
    a) $$CSDATA^ETSRXN: Get Detailed Information about a RxNorm Concept
       Unique Identifier (RXCUI)
    b) $$CSYS^ETSRXN: Retrieve the Coding System Information
    c) $$GETDATA^ETSRXN: Return all information for a RXCUI
    d) $$HIST^ETSRXN: Get Activation History for a RXCUI
    e) $$NDC2RXN^ETSRXN: Return RXCUI for a National Drug Code (NDC)
    f) $$PERIOD^ETSRXN: Get Activation/Inactivation Periods for a RXCUI
    g) $RXN2OUT^ETSRXN: Retrieve a VA Unique Identifier (VUID) and NDC for
       a RXCUI
    h) $$TAX^ETSRXN: Return list of VUIDs in same value set
    i) $$VUICLASS^ETSRXN: Return list of VUIDs with the same drug class
    j) $$VUI2RXN^ETSRXN: Retrieve RXCUI(s) for a valid VUID
  
 4. The following Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC)
    APIs were modified.
  
    a) $$CHKCODE^ETSLNC
        i) Change input value to be the full LOINC Code
       ii) Change return value from Yes/No (1 or 0) to Internal Entry
           Number (IEN)
    b) $$COMLST^ETSLNC: Allow Input of Component Name in addition to
       Component IEN
    c) $$CSDATA^ETSLNC: Change Return value to be the full LOINC Code
    d) $$GETCODE^ETSLNC: 
        i)       Add SHORT NAME (#81) field to the output
       ii)       Change input value to be the full LOINC Code
    e) $$GETNAME^ETSLNC: Change input value to be the full LOINC Code
    f) $$GETREC^ETSLNC
        i) Change input value to be the full LOINC Code
       ii) Add EXTERNAL COPYRIGHT (#84) and COMPONENT (#1) fields to
           the output
    g) $$GETSTAT^ETSLNC: Change input value to be the full LOINC Code
    h) $$HIST^ETSLNC: Change input value to be the full LOINC Code
    i) $$PERIOD^ETSLNC: Change input value to be the full LOINC Code
    j) $$TAX^ETSLNC: Change input value to be the full LOINC Code
  
 5. Modify the screens for the NON-PATIENT SPECIMEN (#1.7) and the 
    TIME MODIFIER (#3.1) fields of the LOINC (#129.1) file.
  
 6. Update sixteen records in the LOINC AXIS CODES (#129.22) so that 
    NAME (#.01) field is unique.
  
 Detailed information on the APIs and the tasks they perform is included
 in the ETS 1.0 Technical Manual/Security Guide.

 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 -------------------------------------------------- 
 Documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this patch
 is available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory 
 at the following OI Field Offices:
  
 Albany:                 domain.ext
 Hines:                  domain.ext    
 Salt Lake City:         domain.ext
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at: http://www.domain.ext/vdl/ under the Clinical folder.

 Software Installation Host file    ETS_1_0_1.KID      ASCII
  
  
 Backout and Rollback Procedure:
 -------------------------------
 The rollback plan for VistA applications is complex and not able to be
 a 'one size fits all' solution. The development team recommends that 
 sites log a CA Service Desk Manager (SDM) ticket for the Health Systems 
 Platform group if this patch needs to be backed-out. The support team will
 determine the best approach to restore the system to its previous state.
 Rollback may be performed prior to response from the support team by 
 first unloading the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
 distribution and then clearing all data from the new files contained in
 this patch:
  
 RXNORM CONCEPT NAMES AND SOURCES (#129.2)
 RXNORM SIMPLE CONCEPT AND ATOM ATTRIBUTES (#129.21)
 RXNORM RELATED CONCEPTS (#129.22)
 RXNORM SEMANTIC TYPES (#129.23)
 RXNORM SOURCE INFORMATION (#129.24)
  
 During the VistA Installation Procedure of the KIDS build, the installer
 should back up the modified routines by the use of the 'Backup a Transport
 Global' action (step 4a in the Installations Instructions below). The
 installer can restore the routines using the MailMan message that were
 saved prior to installing the patch. The backout procedure for data
 dictionary data loads is more complex and may require the issuance of a
 follow-on patch to ensure all components are properly removed. Note that a
 rollback of all software components, including routines must be restored
 to their previous state at the same time and in conjunction with
 restoration of the data.
  
  
 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 There is a pre-install routine PRE^ETS1P1 that prepares the current 
 process for the install.
  
 There is a post-install routine PST^ETS1P1 that will update the NAME
 (#.01) field of the LOINC AXIS CODES (#129.22) file for sixteen records.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take approximately 90
 minutes to install.
  
 Note: Due to the length of time for this installation, the installation 
 process should be queued to avoid installation failure due to session 
 timeout or a forced system reboot/restart.
  
 No options or protocols need to be disabled to install this patch.
  
 The installation of this patch can be queued.
  
 Note: Installation of this patch will require approximately 516 
 megabytes of disk space and 11.2 gigabytes of journal space. 
 Ensure there is sufficient space allocated prior to installation. 
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
  
 1.  OBTAIN PATCH
     ------------
     Obtain the host file ETS_1_0_1.KID, which contains the following 
     patch:
  
         ETS*1.0*1
  
     Sites can retrieve VistA software directly using Secure File Transfer
     Protocol (sFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following
     sFTP address:
  
                     download.vista.domain.ext
  
     This will transmit the files from the first available sFTP server.
     Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
     server as follows:
  
        Albany                  ftp.domain.ext
        Hines                   ftp.domain.ext
        Salt Lake City          ftp.domain.ext
  
     The ETS_1_0_1.KID host file is located in the  
     directory. Use ASCII Mode when downloading the file.
  
     Due to the large size of this patch (approximately 516 megabytes), 
     download may take 20+/- minutes depending upon bandwidth.

     optional options (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter 
     ETS*1.0*1):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
         
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed. It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, data dictionaries, templates, etc.).
  
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
  
 5.  INSTALL THE BUILD
     -----------------
     This is the step to start the installation of this KIDS patch. 
     This will need to be run for the ETS*1.0*1 patch.
