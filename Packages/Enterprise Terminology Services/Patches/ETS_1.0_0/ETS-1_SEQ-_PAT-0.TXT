  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 The Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 Evolution program to modernize VistA includes modernizing Veterans Affairs
 (VA's) enterprise data management capabilities.  Modernizing FileMan will
 functionally standardize VistA's database.  This will enable structured 
 data query and exchange across all VistA instances, creating an enterprise
 view of VistA data in standardized, computable form.  This modernized
 FileMan is called FileMan Enterprise for its enterprise data management
 capabilities.
   
 This patch, ETS*1.0*0, introduces new routines and data dictionaries
 to implement Enterprise Terminology Service (ETS) package. The
 Enterprise Terminology Service package exists to provide enterprise-wide
 access to common code sets that are needed in a health care system. It
 will contain FileMan files with the data and Application Program 
 Interfaces (APIs) that can be used to provide access and process the
 data. The Integration Control Registrations will be supported and thus
 open to all VistA applications.
  
 Specifically, patch ETS*1.0*0 contains the following:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 1. By installing this patch, the Kernel Installation & Distribution 
    System (KIDS) will create the new Enterprise Terminology Service (ETS)
    package namespace automatically.
  
 2. The following new files have been created in ETS to support the move 
    of the LOINC file to ETS.
  
    a) The LOINC file (#129.1)
    b) The LOINC COMPONENT file (#129.11)
    c) The LOINC AXIS CODES file (#129.12)
    d) The LOINC METHOD CODES file (#129.13)
    e) The LOINC EXCLUDED WORDS file (#129.14)
  
 3. The data for the above files will be populated. This will require
    approximately 47 megabytes of disk space and 296 megabytes of journal
    space.
  
 4. The ETS package includes new APIs that will perform the tasks below.
  
    a) Check the overall Activation History of a LOINC Code
    b) Check a LOINC code's Activation History and Status for a
       specified date
    c) Query and retrieve the information for a specific LOINC CODE
    d) Look for all entries within the LOINC database that contain 
       one or more specific terms
    e) Confirm that a LOINC Code exists
    f) Retrieve the LOINC code by using its Internal Entry Number
    g) Retrieve display names for a specific LOINC code
    h) Retrieve a specific LOINC codes current status
    i) Retrieve the current version of the installed LOINC database
    j) Retrieve the list of LOINC Codes currently Deprecated (Deleted)
    k) Retrieve a list of LOINC codes that contain a specified component 
       stored in the LOINC COMPONENT file (#129.11)
  
    Detailed information on the APIs and the tasks they perform is included
    in the ETS 1.0 Technical Manual/Security Guide.

 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch ETS*1.0*0 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in ProPath standard titled: BBM Team 
 Review of VistA Patches. This patch does not alter or modify any VistA 
 Blood Bank software design safeguards or safety critical elements 
 functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch ETS*1.0*0 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 TBD
    
    
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 -------------------------------------------------- 
 Documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this patch
 is available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory 
 at the following OI Field Offices:
   
 Albany:                 domain.ext
 Hines:                  domain.ext    
 Salt Lake City:         domain.ext
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at: http://www.domain.ext/vdl/

 Backout and Rollback Procedure:
 -------------------------------
 The rollback plan for VistA applications is complex and not able to be
 a 'one size fits all' solution. The general strategy for VistA rollback
 is to repair the components with a follow-on patch. The development team
 recommends that sites log a CA Service Desk Manager (SDM) ticket for 
 the Health Systems Platform group if a patch needs to be backed-out. The 
 support team will determine the best approach to restore the system to its
 previous state.

 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
  
 1.  OBTAIN PATCH
     --------------
     Obtain the host file Enterprise_Terminology_Service_1_0.KID, which
     contains the following patch:
  
         ETS*1.0*0
  
     Sites can retrieve VistA software directly using Secure File Transfer
     Protocol (sFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following
     sFTP address:
  
                     download.vista.domain.ext
  
     This will transmit the files from the first available sFTP server.
     Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
     server as follows:
  
        Albany                  ftp.domain.ext
        Hines                   ftp.domain.ext
        Salt Lake City          ftp.domain.ext
  
     The Enterprise_Terminology_Service_1_0.KID host file is located
     in the  directory. Use ASCII Mode when downloading
     the file.
