    option after a site converts to the Veterans Affairs Time and 
    Attendance System (VATAS).
  
 2. Routine PRSAPPU is only coded to calculate pay periods through 
    2017.

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
  
 1. I11774113FY17 - Memoranda Report [PRSP PS MR] Not Working After 
                    Site Move To VATAS.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 After a site moves to VATAS, they no longer use the 'Open Next Pay
 Period' [PRSA PP OPEN] option to keep the VistA pay periods current.
 However, the site will continue to receive data from Austin which
 causes the dates in the PAID PAYRUN DATA (#459) file to exceed 
 the dates in TIME & ATTENDANCE RECORDS (#458) file. A subscript
 error occurs when a more recent date from the PAID PAYRUN DATA (#459) 
 file is used to set data from the TIME & ATTENDANCE RECORDS (#458) file.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PRSPUT3 has been modified to only use dates from the TIME &
 ATTENDANCE RECORDS (#458) file when generating data for the report.
  
 2. I14533016FY17 - PAID - Part Time Physician Memorandum Issue.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Memoranda Report [PRSP PS MR] option does not display 2018 pay 
 periods.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PRSAPPU has been modified to extend pay period calculation through
 2022. Also, routine PRS4P150 has been created to correct any existing
 invalid pay periods created in the Part Time Physician Memorandum as a
 result of this issue.
  
  
 3. Defect #557090 - PAID Monthly Calendar issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Routine PRSLIB01 is currently coded to calculate pay periods through
 2017, and only holidays through 2018. Pay periods beginning in 2018 
 and holidays beginning in 2019 are missing.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PRSLIB01 has been modified to extend pay period calculation
 through 2022 and holidays through 2023.
