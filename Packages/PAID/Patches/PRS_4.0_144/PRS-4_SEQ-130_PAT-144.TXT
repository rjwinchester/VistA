Subject: DECEMBER 26, 2014 HOLIDAY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 On 12/5/2014, President Obama signed an executive order that excuses
 executive branch non-Postal Service employees from duty on Friday, 
 December 26, 2014, except where agency officials decide they must remain
 open because of national security, defense, or other public reasons.
  
 When the President signs an executive order declaring a non-holiday day as
 an official holiday, a patch must be released that will modify the
 software to identify this non-holiday day as a holiday.
  
 This declared holiday falls within pay period 14-25 which runs from
 12/14/2014 through 12/27/2014.
  
 Payroll usually opens pay periods on the Thursday immediately preceding
 the first day of the pay period. For pay period 14-25 this would be
 Thursday 12/11/2014.  For pay period 14-26, this would be Thursday, 
 12/25/2014. However, the VistA PAID/Enhanced Time & Attendance (ETA)
 software will allow the opening of pay periods up to 7 days prior to the
 first day of the pay period.
  
 Patch PRS*4*144 adds December 26, 2014 as a holiday to the Enhanced Time
 and Attendance module of PAID 4.0 (ETA) software.  Because pay period
 14-25 will already be open at the sites, this patch will loop through pp
 14-25 Time & Attendance records and set the holiday as needed.  Once the
 patch is installed, December 26, 2014 will be treated as all other
 holidays in ETA.
  
 ***Note, for employees whose tour has already placed the Christmas Holiday
 on 12/26 due to the employee's tour (example, Sunday-Wednesday, Friday
 tour), the holiday may need to be manually placed, as an existing issue
 with the Open Next Pay Period option may not properly place the Holiday.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000001091544 - December 26, 2014 Holiday
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Presidential Executive Order declares December 26, 2014 as an official 
 federal holiday.  PAID ETA must be updated to reflect this additional
 holiday.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Modified routine PRS8HD to add December 26, 2014 to list of official 
 holidays for 2014.  Also created routine PRSXP144 to loop through pay
 period 14-25 Time & Attendance records and set the holiday.
