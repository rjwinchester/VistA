Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch PRS*4.0*146 addresses two issues:
  
 1. The UNIFORM ALLOWANCE AMT CPPD (#563) field of the PAID EMPLOYEE (#450)
    file and the UNIFORM ALLOWANCE AMT CPPD (#109) field of the EMPLOYEE
    (#459.01) sub-file of the PAID PAYRUN DATA (#459) file does not allow
    a value greater than $999.99.
  
 2. The NURSE T&L UNIT (#15) field of the POC DAILY ACTIVITY
    EXTRACTION (#451.7) file is storing the wrong Time and Leave (T&L).

   ===============
   1) I8671166FY16 - DD Change request per conversation with Pam McClaran
                                                
   Problem:
   -------
   The UNIFORM ALLOWANCE AMT CPPD (#563) field of the PAID EMPLOYEE (#450)
   file and the UNIFORM ALLOWANCE AMT CPPD (#109) field of the EMPLOYEE
   (#459.01) sub-file of the PAID PAYRUN DATA (#459) file does not allow
   a value greater than $999.99. The field should allow a value up to
   $9,999.99, and should not allow a negative value.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The input transform of these fields will be modified to allow a numeric
   value up to $9,999.99, and these fields will also no longer allow
   negative values. Routine PRSDPR06 has been modified to extract 6
   characters of field data instead of 5 to keep in line with the DD
   changes to the UNIFORM ALLOWANCE AMT CPPD (#563) field.
  
   2) I9871077FY16 - File 451.7, field 15, stores incorrect data
   
   Problem:
   -------
   The NURSE T&L UNIT (#15) field of the POC DAILY ACTIVITY
   EXTRACTION (#451.7) file is storing information incorrectly.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The Approve Pay Period POC Records [PRSN APPROV POC PAYPD] option contains
   a FileMan call that is storing T&L based on the IEN of the T&L instead of
   the name. This call will be modified to store the correct T&L Unit.
