 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC0000000723885 - Pt Physician Memorandum Problem
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Sites have reported that some Part Time Physician Memorandums have
 incorrect pay period designations.  The pay periods for 2012 are 
 correct but instead of 2013 pay periods, the 2012 pay periods 
 continued past the valid 12-27 pay period designation (i.e.
 12-28, 12-29, 12-30, etc - instead of 13-01, 13-02, 13-03, etc).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A post install routine has been developed to correct the invalid
 pay period designations in the PT PHYSICIAN MEMORANDUM file (#458.7).
 The routine will also propagate the timecard data for the affected
 pay periods into the Part Time Physician Memorandum.
  
 ROUTINE: PRSXP140
  
  
 2. INC000000765760 - Telework Code Changes
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Human Resources Information System (HRIS) Bulletin 12-18A: AMENDED M/U
 Telework Indicator mandates the addition of two new Telework Codes - M and
 W.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 In order for the new Telework Codes to become active, they must be entered
 into the PAID (Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data System)/ETA 
 (Enhanced Time and Attendance) package via the UPDATE PAID CODES [PRSD
 UPDATE PAID CODES] option.  This option requires the PRSD PAID CODES  
 security key. 
   
 Below is a screen capture of how to input the new codes (after patch
 install):
