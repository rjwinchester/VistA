 1. INC000000840202 - Hybrid Codes
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Central Business Office (CBO) forwarded a current list of Occupation
 Series & Title Codes that are valid Hybrid employees.  The VistA ETA
 hybrid table needs to be updated with the latest codes.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A total of 22 codes are missing from the VistA ETA hybrid table.  The
 following codes must be added to the VistA ETA hybrid table that resides
 in routine PRSAENT1.

 2. INC000000981014 - Saturday Premium Pay for Healthcare Workers
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Healthcare Workers were identified as hybrids and added to the hybrid
 table in patch PRS*4*138.  It was discovered these workers and their 
 associated Occupation Series & Title Codes were not valid hybrid
 employees.  However, there are no risks that the codes were allowing
 employees to be processed as Hybrid employees because valid Hybrid
 employees will have different Pay Plans and Type of Appointment values.  
 These codes just need to be deactivated.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the Hybrid Table routine - PRSAENT1 - to deactivate the
 incorrect Occupation Series & Title codes added in PRS*4*138. 
  
   
 3. INC000000824855 - Spelling error
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The option EMPLOYEE LEAVE PATTERN REPORT [PRSRSU-LEV-PATR] contains 
 a misspelling of the word "Occurrence" in the report heading.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Corrected the spelling error in routine PRSRL41.
