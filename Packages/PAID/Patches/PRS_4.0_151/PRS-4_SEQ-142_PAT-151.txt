Subject: ESR APPROVAL AND OT/CT ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address two issues:
  
  1. An Electronic Subsidiary Record (ESR) cannot be approved for
     an employee name with multiple Internal Entry Numbers (IENs)
     in the PAID EMPLOYEE (#450) file.
   
  2. Timekeepers cannot enter Overtime for a T&L (Time and Leave) when 
     another T&L shares the same code.

  Ticket Overview:
  ================
   
  1. I7278159FY16 - ESR can't be approved                   
  
  Problem:
  --------
  An ESR cannot be approved for an employee name with multiple Internal
  Entry Numbers (IENs) in the PAID EMPLOYEE (#450) file, or multiple
  employees with the same exact name, in the same Time & Leave (T&L)
  Unit.
   
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routine PRSPSAP was modified to loop through all entries in the "ATL"
  index for the employee name in the PAID EMPLOYEE (#450) file.
   
  
  2. I11301705FY17 - BAC - Vista Overtime Issues 
   
  Problem:
  --------
  An undefined error occurs when Timekeepers attempt to enter Overtime for 
  a T&L when another T&L shares the same code.
   
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routine PRSAOTR was modified to pass the T&L selected by the user
  when the ScreenMan API is made. An XINDEX error was also corrected by
  adding a required timeout to an existing lock.
