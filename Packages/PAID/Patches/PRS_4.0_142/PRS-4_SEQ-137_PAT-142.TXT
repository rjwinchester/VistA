Subject: PRS API FIX,REPORT OPTION UNDEF AND SUBSCR ERROR FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch PRS*4.0*142 addresses four issues:
  
 1. PAID (Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data System) options that use
    PRIMLOC^PRSNUT03 to return a nurses primary assignment will return an
    incorrect location if that location has a similar string to another.
  
 2. The Mismatch Report by T&L Unit [PRSNR MISMATCHES BY T&L] option will not
    display the first entry in a report. 
  
 3. The Mismatch Report by T&L Unit [PRSNR MISMATCHES BY T&L] option will
    produce an undefined error when an employee has work hours associated with a
    non-regular tour of duty.
  
 4. The All Non Direct Activity at a Nurse Location [PRSNR NURLOC NONDIR -
    COORD] option will produce a subscript error if an employee who worked as a
    nurse during the date range of the report is not currently a nurse.

 OVERVIEW:
 =========
 1) I9871940FY16    - nursing locations that are not being tracked
                      appropriately 
                                                
 Problem:
 --------
 PAID options [NURSING LOCATION FILE, EDIT] and [STATUS AND POSITION] that
 use PRIMLOC^PRSNUT03 to return a nurses primary assignment will return an
 incorrect location if that location has a similar string to another.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Adding the "O" flag to the FIND^DIC call in PRIMLOC^PRSNUT03 will return only
 one exact match for the primary assignment.
  
 2) I7526963FY16 - When using the VistA option: MISMATCH REPORT BY T&L UNIT
                   the first entry is skipped
 Problem:
 --------
 The Mismatch Report by T&L Unit [PRSNR MISMATCHES BY T&L] option does not
 display the first entry (ETA TIMECARD vs. POINT OF CARE RECORD) in a
 report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Using NULL instead of variable PRSIEN in the PRSNRMM1 routine prevents the
 first record from being skipped. 
  
 3) I9878297FY16    - One particular T&L halts VISTA during reports, NM
                      unable to approve POC in that T&L. 
                   
 Problem:
 --------
 The Mismatch Report by T&L Unit [PRSNR MISMATCHES BY T&L] option will produce
 an undefined error when an employee has work hours associated with a 
 non-regular tour of duty.
      
 Resolution:
 -----------
 In the PRSNRMM routine, adding a QUIT condition that will be executed if
 variable LONGSEG equals NULL will resolve the undefined error.
  
 4) I9880162FY16 - PRSN COORDINATOR REPORTS MENU Errors out 
   
 Problem:
 --------
 The All Non Direct Activity at a Nurse Location [PRSNR NURLOC NONDIR -
 COORD] option will produce a subscript error if an employee who worked as a
 nurse during the date range of the report is not currently a nurse.
       
 Resolution:
 -----------
 In the PRSNRLND routine, variables NUROLE and PRSNTWD will be set to contain
 a space if they have a NULL value which will resolve the subscript error.
