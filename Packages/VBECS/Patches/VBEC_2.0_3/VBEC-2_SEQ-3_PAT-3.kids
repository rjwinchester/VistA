Installation Instructions:
"BLD",7700,1,101,0)
==========================
"BLD",7700,1,102,0)
This patch may be loaded with users on the system.
"BLD",7700,1,103,0)
Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
"BLD",7700,1,104,0)
 
"BLD",7700,1,105,0)
    1) Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
"BLD",7700,1,106,0)
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
"BLD",7700,1,107,0)
    2) From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu,
"BLD",7700,1,108,0)
       select the Installation menu.
"BLD",7700,1,109,0)
    3) From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
"BLD",7700,1,110,0)
       (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter VBEC*2*3).
"BLD",7700,1,111,0)
       a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
"BLD",7700,1,112,0)
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
"BLD",7700,1,113,0)
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
"BLD",7700,1,114,0)
       b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
"BLD",7700,1,115,0)
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
"BLD",7700,1,116,0)
          is installed. It compares all components of the patch
"BLD",7700,1,117,0)
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
"BLD",7700,1,118,0)
       c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
"BLD",7700,1,119,0)
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
"BLD",7700,1,120,0)
          transport global.
"BLD",7700,1,121,0)
       d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view 
"BLD",7700,1,122,0)
          the components of the KIDS build.
"BLD",7700,1,123,0)
    4) Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
"BLD",7700,1,124,0)
       VBEC*2*3.
"BLD",7700,1,125,0)
    5) When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
"BLD",7700,1,126,0)
       NO//'  respond NO
"BLD",7700,1,127,0)
    6) When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
"BLD",7700,1,128,0)
       and Protocols? NO//'  respond NO.

Back-Out Plan
"BLD",7700,1,131,0)
 -------------
"BLD",7700,1,132,0)
 During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as 
"BLD",7700,1,133,0)
 directed, "Backup a Transport Global", then routines will have the 
"BLD",7700,1,134,0)
 ability to be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was 
"BLD",7700,1,135,0)
 generated. However, the KIDS installation process does not perform a 
"BLD",7700,1,136,0)
 restore of other VistA components, such as data dictionary, 
"BLD",7700,1,137,0)
 cross-reference, and template changes, etc. 
"BLD",7700,1,138,0)
  
"BLD",7700,1,139,0)
 Prior to attempting a back-out of the software, submit a YOUR IT 
"BLD",7700,1,140,0)
Services 
"BLD",7700,1,141,0)
 ticket with the Enterprise Service Desk (ESD) for assistance with the 
"BLD",7700,1,142,0)
 procedure. 
"BLD",7700,1,143,0)
  
"BLD",7700,1,144,0)
 For VistA patches, the general strategy for back-out is to repair the 
"BLD",7700,1,145,0)
 code with another follow-on patch. Depending on each individual patch, 
"BLD",7700,1,146,0)
 sites will be given a procedure detailing how to complete the back-out.
"BLD",7700,1,147,0)
  
"BLD",7700,1,148,0)
 If any issue(s) with the software are discovered after it is nationally 
"BLD",7700,1,149,0)
 released the development team will research the issue and provide 
"BLD",7700,1,150,0)
 guidance for any immediate, possible work around.
"BLD",7700,1,151,0)
  
"BLD",7700,1,152,0)
 Long-term solutions will be one of the following: installation of a 
"BLD",7700,1,153,0)
 follow-up patch to correct the defect, a follow-up patch to remove the 
"BLD",7700,1,154,0)
 defective updates, or a procedure detailing how the software can be 
"BLD",7700,1,155,0)
 safely backed out of the production system.

Installation Instructions:
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,101,0)
==========================
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,102,0)
This patch may be loaded with users on the system.
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,103,0)
Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,104,0)
 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,105,0)
    1) Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,106,0)
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,107,0)
    2) From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu,
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,108,0)
       select the Installation menu.
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,109,0)
    3) From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,110,0)
       (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter VBEC*2*3).
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,111,0)
       a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,112,0)
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,113,0)
          backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,114,0)
       b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,115,0)
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,116,0)
          is installed. It compares all components of the patch
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,117,0)
          (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,118,0)
       c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,119,0)
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,120,0)
          transport global.
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,121,0)
       d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,122,0)
          the components of the KIDS build.
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,123,0)
    4) Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,124,0)
       VBEC*2*3.
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,125,0)
    5) When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,126,0)
       NO//'  respond NO
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,127,0)
    6) When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,128,0)
       and Protocols? NO//'  respond NO.
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,129,0)

Back-Out Plan
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,131,0)
 -------------
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,132,0)
 During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,133,0)
 directed, "Backup a Transport Global", then routines will have the 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,134,0)
 ability to be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,135,0)
 generated. However, the KIDS installation process does not perform a 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,136,0)
 restore of other VistA components, such as data dictionary, 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,137,0)
 cross-reference, and template changes, etc. 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,138,0)
  
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,139,0)
 Prior to attempting a back-out of the software, submit a YOUR IT 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,140,0)
Services 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,141,0)
 ticket with the Enterprise Service Desk (ESD) for assistance with the 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,142,0)
 procedure. 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,143,0)
  
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,144,0)
 For VistA patches, the general strategy for back-out is to repair the 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,145,0)
 code with another follow-on patch. Depending on each individual patch, 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,146,0)
 sites will be given a procedure detailing how to complete the back-out.
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,147,0)
  
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,148,0)
 If any issue(s) with the software are discovered after it is nationally 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,149,0)
 released the development team will research the issue and provide 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,150,0)
 guidance for any immediate, possible work around.
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,151,0)
  
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,152,0)
 Long-term solutions will be one of the following: installation of a 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,153,0)
 follow-up patch to correct the defect, a follow-up patch to remove the 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,154,0)
 defective updates, or a procedure detailing how the software can be 
"PKG",649,22,1,"PAH",1,1,155,0)
 safely backed out of the production system.
