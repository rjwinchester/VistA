 BLOOD BANK CLEARANCE
 ====================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch VBEC*2*3 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of 
 VISTA Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch does 
 not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design safeguards or 
 safety critical elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch VBEC*2*3 have no adverse effect on 
 VistA Blood Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
 ========================
 The VBECS 2.3.1 server patch requires customer validation in the local 
 Test account prior to installation in Production to meet Food & Drug 
 Administration (FDA) requirements. The user validates the Blood Bank 
 software for its intended use prior to its acceptance and use for patient 
 care. The VBECS 2.3.1 Release Notes contain descriptions of the changes 
 made in this patch and includes validation scenarios.
  
 It is imperative that the AITC coordinate the installation of the VBECS 
 2.3.1 server patch with Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Service staff to 
 allow adequate time for impact analysis and testing the changes prior to 
 installation in Production.

 Release 
 Notes document for pre and post installation information and instructions.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:

 Notes document for pre and post installation information and instructions.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch may be loaded with users on the system.
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
     1) Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
        the KIDS distribution included with this message.
     2) From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu,
        select the Installation menu.
     3) From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
        (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter VBEC*2*3).
        a) Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
        b) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed. It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        c) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
        d) Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view 
           the components of the KIDS build.
     4) Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        VBEC*2*3.
     5) When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
        NO//'  respond NO
     6) When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
        and Protocols? NO//'  respond NO.
  
 Back-Out Plan
  -------------
  During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as 
  directed, "Backup a Transport Global", then routines will have the 
  ability to be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was 
  generated. However, the KIDS installation process does not perform a 
  restore of other VistA components, such as data dictionary, 
  cross-reference, and template changes, etc. 
   
  Prior to attempting a back-out of the software, submit a YOUR IT 
 Services 
  ticket with the Enterprise Service Desk (ESD) for assistance with the 
  procedure. 
   
  For VistA patches, the general strategy for back-out is to repair the 
  code with another follow-on patch. Depending on each individual patch, 
  sites will be given a procedure detailing how to complete the back-out.
   
  If any issue(s) with the software are discovered after it is nationally 
  released the development team will research the issue and provide 
  guidance for any immediate, possible work around.
   
  Long-term solutions will be one of the following: installation of a 
  follow-up patch to correct the defect, a follow-up patch to remove the 
  defective updates, or a procedure detailing how the software can be 
  safely backed out of the production system.
