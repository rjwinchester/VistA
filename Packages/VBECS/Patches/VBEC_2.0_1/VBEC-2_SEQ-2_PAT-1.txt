 BLOOD BANK CLEARANCE
 ====================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch VBEC*2*1 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of 
 VISTA Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch does 
 not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design safeguards or 
 safety critical elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch VBEC*2*1 have no adverse effect on 
 VistA Blood Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
 ========================
 The VBECS 2.3.0 update and VBEC*2*1 require customer validation in the 
 local Test account prior to installation in Production to meet Food & 
 Drug Administration (FDA) requirements. The user validates the Blood Bank 
 software for its intended use prior to its acceptance and use for patient 
 care. The VBECS 2.3.0 Release Notes contain descriptions of the changes 
 made in this patch and includes validation scenarios.
  
 It is imperative that the installation of VBEC*2*1 occur prior to the 
 validation of the VBECS 2.3.0 server patch. Coordinate the installation 
 with Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Service staff to allow adequate time 
 for impact analysis and testing the changes prior to installation in 
 Production.
