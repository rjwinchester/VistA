Description:
============

 PATCH DESCRIPTION:
 ==================
 VistA patch VBEC*2.0*0 is exported as part of the VistA Blood 
 Establishment Computer System (VBECS) Version 2.2.0 release.
  
 VBEC*2.0*0 updates the version number in the second line of the VBEC name 
 spaced routines. No other changes to functionality have been made. The 
 patch must be installed in your VistA account. 
  
  
 ANNOUNCEMENT FOR VBECS 2.2.0 SERVER PATCH:
 ==========================================
 In addition to updating VBEC routines in VistA this patch serves to alert 
 VA facilities using the Vista Blood Establishment Computer Software 
 (VBECS) that VBECS 2.2.0 server patch has been released for installation.
  
 VBECS 2.2.0 will be installed by System Administrators at the Austin 
 Information Technology Center (AITC). A full description of patch changes 
 and implementation process are included in the VBECS 2.2.0 Release Notes. 
  
 The expected downtime is approximately one hour for the installation in 
 both the Test and Production account. The Test and Production account 
 will be installed separately and both will be unavailable during each 
 install.
  
 This patch provides a new interface for connecting automated blood bank 
 instruments to VBECS along with a few corrections. The patch is being 
 released with a one hundred twenty (120) day compliance date.
  
  
 BLOOD BANK CLEARANCE: 
 =====================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch VBEC*2.0*0 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in BBM TEAM REVIEW OF VISTA PATCHES. 
 This patch does not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design 
 safeguards or safety critical elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch VBEC*2.0*0 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
  
 DATA DICTIONARY:
 ================
  N/A
  
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
 ========================
 There are no validation requirements for VistA patch VBEC*2.0*0.
  
 The VBECS 2.2.0 server patch requires customer validation in the local 
 Test account prior to installation in Production to meet Food & Drug 
 Administration (FDA) requirements. The user validates the Blood Bank 
 software for its intended use prior to its acceptance and use for patient 
 care. The VBECS 2.2.0 Release Notes contain descriptions of the changes 
 made in this patch and includes validation scenarios.
  
 Therefore, it is imperative that the AITC coordinate the installation of 
 the VBECS 2.2.0 server patch with Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Service 
 staff to allow adequate time for impact analysis and testing the changes 
 prior to installation in Production.
