Subject: RELEASE OF VBECS 2.1.0 SERVER PATCH

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This information patch (VBEC*1*87) serves to alert VA facilities using 
 the Vista Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) that VBECS 2.1.0 
 server patch has been released for installation.
  
 Sites who have not installed VBECS have no action to take with this 
 informational patch.
  
 This patch will be installed by System Administrators at the Austin 
 Information Technology Center (AITC). Please see Appendix C of the VBECS 
 2.1.0 Release Notes for details.
  
 A full description of patch changes and implementation process are 
 included in the VBECS 2.1.0 Release Notes.
  
 The expected downtime is approximately one hour for the installation in 
 both the Test and Production account. The Test and Production account 
 will be installed separately and will be unavailable during each install.
  
 This patch addresses defects in system operation, includes performance 
 enhancements and is being released with a one hundred twenty (120) day 
 compliance date.
  
 BLOOD BANK CLEARANCE
 ====================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch VBEC*1.0*87 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of 
 VISTA Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch does 
 not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design safeguards or 
 safety critical elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch VBEC*1.0*87 have no effect on VistA 
 Blood Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
 ========================
 The VBECS 2.1.0 server patch requires customer validation in the local 
 Test account prior to installation in Production to meet Food & Drug 
 Administration (FDA) requirements. The user validates the Blood Bank 
 software for its intended use prior to its acceptance and use for patient 
 care. The VBECS 2.1.0 Release Notes contain descriptions of the changes 
 made in this patch and includes validation scenarios.
  
 Therefore, it is imperative that the AITC coordinate the installation of 
 the VBECS 2.1.0 server patch with Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Service 
 staff to allow adequate time for impact analysis and testing the changes 
 prior to installation in Production.
