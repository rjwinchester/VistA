Description:
============

 VBEC*1*54 is exported as part of the VistA Blood Establishment Computer 
 System (VBECS) Version 2.0.0 release.
  
 VBECS 2.0.0 is a controlled release, and a guided installation on remote 
 hosted Windows 2008 virtual machines. Your site will be contacted by the 
 VBECS team to schedule a date for that installation and to verify that 
 the required site personnel will be available. All required installation 
 files will be supplied by the VBECS team during the installation and the 
 VBECS team will be online with the site during the entire installation. 
  
 You may install VBEC*1*54 at any time, or you may wait and install it 
 during the formal VBECS 2.0.0 installation. 
  
 To meet Food & Drug Administration (FDA) requirements, VBECS related 
 VistA (Veterans Health Information Systems Technology Architecture) 
 patches require customer validation in local Test accounts prior to 
 installation in Production. The user validates the Blood Bank software 
 for its intended use prior to its acceptance and use for patient care.
  
 Therefore, to allow adequate time for impact analysis and testing the 
 changes prior to installation in Production, it is imperative that Office 
 of Information Technology (OIT) Field Operations coordinate the 
 installation of Blood Bank software patches with Pathology & Laboratory 
 Medicine Service staff.
  
 The VBEC*1*54 patch addresses several issues. Refer to the sample 
 validation scenarios listed with the correction to verify changes: 
  
  1. 109 VistA MR 103013 - The CPRS Blood Bank Report, Diagnostic Tests
       Section has displayed Transfusion Reaction Workup test results
       with patient Type and Screen test results. This was not done by
       the legacy blood bank system. The change made to the VBECA1B1
       routine will eliminate Transfusion Reaction Workup test results
       from the Blood Bank Report, Diagnostic Tests Section. Note - the
       Transfusion Reactions Section of the CPRS Blood Bank Report does
       not change and will still display Transfusion Reaction
       Interpretations.
       Associated Remedy Tickets: INC000000923654 and INC000000925197.
  
       Verification: Locate a patient with a Transfusion Reaction in VBECS.
       Using this patient run the CPRS Blood Bank Report and note that
       transfusion reaction testing is visible in the Diagnostic Tests
       Section and the Transfusion Reactions Section has an interpretation.
       Install VBEC*1*54. Repeat the lookup of the CPRS Blood Bank Report
       and verify that the transfusion reaction testing is absent in the
       CPRS Blood Bank Report, Diagnostic Tests Section. Verify that the
       Transfusion Reactions Section of the CPRS Blood Bank Report does
       not change and still displays the Transfusion Reaction
       Interpretations after VBEC*1*54 is installed.
  
  2. 110 VistA MR 121713 - VBECS was able to accept a specimen when the
       CPRS order was assigned a Lab accession number as the order was
       added to a collection list and the specimen was not collected (no
       collection date/time). This change requires that the specimen
       accession number must also have a collection date and time in VistA
       before it can be used in VBECS for processing.
  
       Remedy Ticket: INC000000948143
  
       Verification: Attempt to accept a VBECS order with a blood bank
       specimen that does not have a collection date and time assigned in
       VistA but has been assigned an accession number per a Lab collection
       list.  VBECS will allow processing of the specimen UID for an order
       only when the specimen has a date and time collected assigned after
       VBEC*1*54 is installed.
  
  3. 111 VistA MR 061214 - The release of ICD*18.0*57 started a 
       retirement countdown for ICR 3990 used to lookup ICD codes. This 
       lookup is used by the LRBLPCH (Patient transfusions & hematology 
       results) option in VistA Blood Bank. No new transfusion 
       data has been entered since LR*5.2*408 (compliance date August 18, 
       2011) was installed to turn off VistA Blood Bank. The end 
       result is that the LRBLPCH option is obsolete and the change to 
       ICD codes is not relevant. The LRBLPCH option will be placed out 
       of order with the installation of this patch.
  
       Verification: Any attempt to execute the option will return a
       message that it is out of order.
  
  4. 112 VistA MR 111914 - Workload configuration and details are not
       maintained in the development accounts which results in errors when
       the workload process is triggered. Minor changes to the VistA 
       workload code prevents the workload process from proceeding when 
       there is no workload to process. Changes to the VBECRPCC routine
       will prevent the error caused when there is no workload to process.
  
       Verification: None
  
  
 There is also a VistA Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) 
 2.0.0 server update that is also being released. Please refer 
 to the VistA Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) 2.0.0 
 Release Notes for detailed information about corrections in that release.
