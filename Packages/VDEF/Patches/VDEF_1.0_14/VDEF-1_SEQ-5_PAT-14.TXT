Associated patches: (v)VDEF*1*3    <<= must be installed BEFORE `VDEF*1*14'

Subject: VDEF REQUEST PROCESSOR NAME VALUE PAIR VALIDATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix the VDEF Request Processor so that when it
 encounters a VDEF REQUEST QUEUE file (#579.3) record NAME 
 VALUE PAIRS MULTIPLE (#579.311) with an internal entry 
 number value other than a one (1) or two (2) it will continue
 processing as long as the data associated with each respective
 node is valid.

 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
 I6652339FY16 VDEF REQUEST QUEUE events  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 When the VDEF Request Processor encounters a VDEF REQUEST QUEUE 
 file (#579.3) record NAME VALUE PAIRS MULTIPLE (#579.311) with 
 an internal entry number (ien) value other than a one (1) or two (2)
 it assumes the record is corrupt and halts processing even
 though the data may be valid. 
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Rather than validating the NAME VALUE PAIRS MULTIPLE (#579.311)
 records based on the ien or assuming it should be a one (1) or 
 two (2), it will continue processing regardless of the subscript
 or ien and validate based on the data in the record.
