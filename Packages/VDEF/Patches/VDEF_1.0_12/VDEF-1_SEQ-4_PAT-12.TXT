Subject: TIME_VDEFUTIL INPUT TRANSFORM AND WAKEUP PERIOD DD

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch will fix the input transform utility that inadvertently
 restricted the values to greater than 30 days and update the REQUEST
 QUEUE WAKEUP PERIOD description to reflect how the field is
 defined.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000001065808    VDEF - Other:
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 When patch VDEF*1.0*11 was released, it inadvertently restricted the 
 REQUEST QUEUE WAKEUP PERIOD field (#.02) and the CHECK-OUT TIME LIMIT
 field (#.05) of the VDEF REQUEST QUEUE file (#579.3) and the VDEF 
 MONITOR DELAY field (#.02) of the VDEF PARAMETERS file (#579.5)  
 date fields to times of greater than 30 days by editing input
 transform utility $$TIMEI^VDEFUTIL when only the ARCHIVAL PARAMETER (#.04)
 of the VDEF REQUEST QUEUE file (#579.3) was intended.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch will restore the utility back to its pre-VDEF*1.0*11 form
 which will remove the restrictions from the REQUEST QUEUE WAKEUP PERIOD
 field (#.02) and the CHECK-OUT TIME LIMIT field (#.05) of the VDEF 
 REQUEST QUEUE file (#579.3) and the VDEF MONITOR DELAY field (#.02) of
 the VDEF PARAMETERS file (#579.5) and modify the input transform directly
 for the ARCHIVAL PARAMETER field (#.04) in the VDEF REQUEST QUEUE file
 (#579.3) directly to restrict to values greater than 30 days.

 2. INC000001094661    REQUEST QUEUE WAKEUP PERIOD
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 The "HELP-PROMPT" and "DESCRIPTION" for the REQUEST QUEUE WAKEUP PERIOD 
 (#.02) in the VDEF REQUEST QUEUE file (#579.3) contradict the INPUT
 TRANSFORM and documentation of the field.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Update the "HELP-PROMPT" and "DESCRIPTION" to reflect what is documented
 in the manuals and how the field is defined.
