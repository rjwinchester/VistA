Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues.
  
 2 problems occur when using the "Enter Diagnosis" option under the VistA 
 Mental Health [YSUSER] application menu.
  
 1.      An UNDEFINED hard error occurs as an existing issue in an 
 unremediated environment for VistA Mental Health and is carried over to 
 the ICD-10 remediated environment (YS*5.01*107) for both ICD-9 and ICD-10 
 diagnosis code searches.
 2.      A warning message loops in the remediated environment for both 
 ICD-9 and ICD-10 code sets within the ICD diagnosis code search process.

 Duplicate(S): INC000001071348 (REMEDY)
  
  
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 An "<UNDEFINED>" error has been encountered by Vista Mental Health
 application users when prompted to "Enter ICD-9 DIAGNOSIS:" or 
 "Enter ICD-10 DIAGNOSIS:"; and the error's text begins 
 specifically with "<UNDEFINED>ICDP+2^YSDX3UA".
  
 Solution 1:
 -----------
 Modify routine ^YSDX3UA coding to maintain appropriate data per
 the appropriate VistA Mental Health application data variable(s)
  
 Problem 2:
 ----------
 A continuous "message loop" has been encountered by Vista Mental 
 Health application users after a diagnosis search had been done
 and the user selected an "Invalid Diagnosis".  The VistA Mental
 Health application displayed the appropriate warning message, 
 but then continued to display that same warning message when a
 subsequent "Valid Diagnosis" was selected.
  
 Solution 2:
 -----------
 Modify the VistA Mental Health application to display the 
 "Invalid Diagnosis" warning message when appropriate.

 option of PackMan to see what parts the message contains.
 Those parts that are not routines should be backed up separately
 if they need to be preserved.
