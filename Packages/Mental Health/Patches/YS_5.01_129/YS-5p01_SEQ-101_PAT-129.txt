Associated patches: (v)YS*5.01*119     install with patch       `YS*5.01*129'

Subject: MHA GUI UPDATE FOR 2FA

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch will be used to update the current Mental Health Assistant (MHA) 
 for use with an updated RPC Broker in support of the two-factor 
 authentication effort.
  
 Upgrading MHA from Delphi 7 to XE8 was required in order to use this version 
 of the Broker.  Modifications to the Delphi code were required and made to 
 accomplish this upgrade.
     
 The patch also removes the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Manager from
 the Mental Health Assistant and addresses issues resulting from the upgrade in
 the graphing and charting feature of MHA as well as deficiencies.
    
 The following existing instruments are modified:
 ================================================
  Beck Anxiety Inventory                                  BAI
    a) Changed information text in the Instrument Results Review to reflect
       the following:
        
       The overall range is 0 to 63.
        
       0-7      Minimal level of anxiety
       8-15     Mild anxiety
       16-25    Moderate anxiety
       26-63    Severe anxiety 
   
  Beck Depression Inventory--Second Edition               BDI2
    a) Added the following verbiage to the Instrument Results Review
        
         1 point = mild symptom level 
         2 points = moderate symptom level
         3 points = severe symptom level
  
  Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2           MMPI-2-RF
    -Restructured Form
    a) changed the report text as follows:
           Higher Order to Higher-Order
           Self_Doubt to Self-Doubt
           Behavior_Restricting to Behavior-Restricting
           Aesthetic_Literary to Aesthetic-Literary
           Mechanical_Physical to Mechanical-Physical
  
    b) In the Instrument Administrator option, fixed a problem with 
       the progress bar color to correctly indicate when all questions 
       are answered.
  
    c) When the COG (Cognitive Complaints) T-score is high, the report no
       longer displays an erroneous message about the SUI (Suicidal/Death
       Ideation) T-score being high.
  
  NEO Personality Inventory-3                             NEO-PI-3
    a) Fixed scoring issues with T-Scores and Factor scores 
  
  Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale           PHQ9
    a) Changed choices so that they are now numbered 0-3 instead of
       1-4.  This more closely matches the paper form.
  
  PTSD Symptom Checklist for DSM 5                        PCL-5
    a) Made the PCL-5 available on the Special Results tab in the 
       Instrument Review Results module
  
  Quality of Life Inventory                               QOLI
    a) Changed the score bar delimiter in the Instrument Results Review 
       option output from a "*" (i.e., asterisk) to a capital "I".

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ----------------------------
 HD0000000952874 - POQ
  Problem: The following statement did not line wrap correctly and Veteran 
  was not capitalized: Higher percentile scores denote Veteran's self-
  reports of increased symptom severity when compared to comparison groups 
  of Veterans with pain treated in inpatient or outpatient 
  multidisciplinary pain settings.
  Solution: Capitalized Veteran and corrected the line wrapping issue.
  
 HD0000000806297 - Crash File Missing Header Line.
  Problem: If the MHA GUI aborts, for whatever reason (e.g., system crash),
  the MHA writes the information it has already collected to a "crash" file
  on the workstation. When the user connects to the MHA the next time, the
  MHA GUI displays a message to the user who can continue with that
  administration and save the information to the database. For some
  instruments, the crash file was not built correctly, and the information
  in the crash file was useless and had to be discarded. 
  Solution: The patch corrects the problem so the crash file is properly
  built.
  
 HD0000000816662 - Mental Health - Mental Health Assistant
  Problem: If the user has a DUZ value of more than 9 characters in length 
  and tries to sign an Addiction Severity Index (ASI) entry, there is an
  error message. The user cannot sign the ASI entry.
  Solution: The software now recognizes long DUZ values and allows the user
  to sign the entry.
  
 HD0000000946589 - An error occurs on the Special Results Tab if a BAM 
  instrument has more than 3 administrations completed.
  Problem: Under the Special Results tab in the Instrument Results Review 
  option, if the BAM has more than 3 administrations, an error occurs, then
  the three oldest BAM administrations are displayed rather than the most 
  recent 3.
  Solution: The access error is fixed. Instruments with no scales now
  display all instances of the instrument administration starting with the
  most recent. Instruments with scales will display up to 6 administrations
  starting with the most recent.
  
 I12166629FY17, R13148174FY17 - PHQ9
  Problem: The choices for each question are numbered 1-4, while the paper 
  version numbers the choices 0-3.
  Solution: The choices in MHA are now numbered 0-3 to match the paper 
  version.
