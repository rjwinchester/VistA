Subject: BEHAVIORAL HEALTH LAB (BHL) v5.3 COTS SOFTWARE - INFORMATIONAL

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch is used for information announcement purposes of availability 
 of an upgrade for the Behavioral Health Lab Commercial Off The Shelf 
 (COTS) software. The utilization of the Behavioral Health Lab COTS 
 software is optional however this upgrade is required for facilities that 
 have the software currently installed. 
  
 The BHL Software is a flexible and user-friendly COTS tool designed to 
 facilitate the delivery of measurement based behavioral health care. The 
 software supports Primary Care - Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) 
 programs by providing customizable decision support, patient tracking 
 tools and structured assessments to monitor patient symptoms and inform 
 treatment decisions. The installation and usage of this software is at 
 the discretion of the local Mental Health staff. 
  
 The BHL Software is a Windows client application (.exe) that has been 
 certified to run on VA staff workstations running Windows XP/7/8. BHL was 
 added to the VA TRM on 2/9/2015. The BHL's interface to VistA is based on 
 the RPC Broker and the usage of pre-existing RPCs thus NO new or modified 
 M routines are required or included in this patch.
