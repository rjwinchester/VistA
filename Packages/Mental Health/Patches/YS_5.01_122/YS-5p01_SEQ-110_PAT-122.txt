Description:
============

 This patch will add enhancements to the Inpatient Order Entry routines for
 the National Clozapine Coordination project.  Below is a list of all the 
 applications involved in this project along with their patch numbers:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    MENTAL HEALTH (MH) V. 5.01                          YS*5.01*122
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                     PSO*7*457 
    INPATIENT MEDICATIONS (IP) V. 5.0                   PSJ*5*327
    ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING (OR) V. 3.0           OR*3*427
  
 The patches (PSJ*5*327, PSO*7*457, YS*5.01*122, and OR*3*427) are 
 being released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System
 (KIDS) multi-build distribution MENTAL HEALTH NCC PROJECT 5.01.
  
 Abbreviations for terms used in the multi-build patch descriptions 
 include the National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC) located in
 Dallas, Texas; Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC); White Blood Cells (WBC);
 Initial Operating Capability (IOC); and Computerized Patient Record 
 System (CPRS).
  
 The purpose of this software package is to maintain compliance with 
 legislative and federal mandates, as well as to add Clozapine Order
 Checking to the Inpatient Pharmacy application. In addition, this 
 package replaces the weekly roll-up functionality and now transmits 
 data to the National Clozapine server nightly.
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 The routines related to validation of the ANC Lab values, Local override
 Reasons for both Inpatient/Outpatient Clozapine orders and daily
 reporting of the Clozapine orders to the Hines Clozapine server will be
 modified:
  
 1.  The Mental Health CLAPI routine ^YSCLTST2 will be modified
     To use the new FDA guidelines for the ANC Lab values in 
     determining if overrides are required to continue processing.
  
 2.  The override logic will be modified to allow local overrides
     If the ANC Lab values are >= 1000 and < 1500  
  
 3.  The reporting logic will be modified to store the Clozapine order
     information in an XTMP variable and send the days Clozapine order
     information to the Hines Clozapine server via a Mailman message
     every night.
  
 4.  Add a new routine YSCLDIS that will discontinue Clozapine Patients
     status when
     a. An emergency 4 day registration was performed on a patient
        during hours when the NCCC is not available to register the
        patient into the Clozapine program.
     b. A patient was registered in the Clozapine Program and has not
        been prescribed any Clozapine at all in the first 28 days of
        being registered.
     c. A registered Clozapine patient has not been prescribed any
        Clozapine in the last 56 days.
  
 5.  Add logic to send a Mailman message to NCCC notifying the NCCC
     that a patient was discontinued from the Clozapine program.
  
 6.  Add new menu option to be used to manually transmit the previous
     day's Inpatients Clozapine Orders and the Outpatient Clozapine
     Prescriptions to the Hines Database server.  This option can
     also be scheduled to run nightly via Taskman.
  
 7.  VistA option Weekly Clozapine Report [YSCL WEEKLY TRANSMISSION]
     will be set to out of order. If a user attempts to run this option
     they will receive 'Replaced by YSCL DAILY TRANSMISSION' message.
  
 8.  VistA option Transmit Clozapine Demographics [YSCL TRANSMIT
     DEMOGRAPHICS] will be set to out of order. 
  
 9.  The ^YSCLTST2 routine was modified to run REX^YSCLTST5 to manually
     execute the Retransmit of daily Clozapine orders (both Inpatient
     and Outpatient) to the Hines database. This routine will also
     prompt the user for start and end dates.
  
 10. ^YSCLSERV routine was modified to accept a date range for the
     start and end dates to the retransmission of daily Inpatient and
     Outpatient Clozapine orders. The routine will accept a single date
     to retransmit a single day's Inpatient and Outpatient Clozapine 
     orders.
  
 11. Add 4 new fields to the CLOZAPINE PARAMETERS file (#603.03) which
     is stored in ^YSLC(603.03,1,0).  The four new fields:
        RX LAB PROD LISTENER   (#8)
        DEMOGRAPHIC PROD LISTENER   (#9)
        RX LAB TEST LISTENER   (#10)
        DEMOGRAPHIC TEST LISTENER   (#11)
     These are used by Mailman to identify the servers that the YSCL DAILY
     TRANSMISSION option uses to transmit Clozapine Demographics, 
     Outpatient RX, and Inpatient Order transaction data to the Hines
     FOURWORD server for FDA reporting.
