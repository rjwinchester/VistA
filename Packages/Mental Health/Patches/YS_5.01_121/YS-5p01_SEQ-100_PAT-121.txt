  -- Prior to this patch, this instrument name was ASSIST.
     Now it is ASSIST-WHOV3.
  
  Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment - Alcohol
  Revised                                              CIWA-AR-

  displays the information in the correct order. This instrument
  replaces CIWA-AR.
  
  Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily 
  Living                                               KATZ-ADL-18PT

 This patch also changes the cut off point for the Posttraumatic Stress

 Recent PCL-5 results are now included in the PTSD reminder dialogs.
  
 The reports for Addiction Severity Index (ASI) and Seclusion/Restraints 
 have been updated to use the last 4 of the SSN instead of the full SSN.
  
 A new option has been added to the YTQ MHA3 MENU called Instrument 
 Exchange. This allow updated instrument definitions to be loaded from a
 file or web site and viewed or installed.
