Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

  
   The purpose of this Mental Health patch YS*5.01*156 is to provide 
 information regarding a hot fix for version 1.0.0.3 of the National 
 Clozapine Registry (NCR) graphical user interface (GUI).  The NCR is 
 maintained by the National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC).  The 
 NCCC is responsible for VA's compliance with the clozapine Risk 
 Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), which was mandated by the Food 
 and Drug Administration (FDA) for tracking clozapine patients.
   
   The NCR v1.0.0.3 GUI is only available to staff at the NCCC.  The 
 software for this hot fix will be hosted in the VA cloud servers.  No 
 site involvement is needed and there are no components added to VistA.  
 This patch provides the documentation of the changes made to this cloud 
 based application.  
  
  
 Hot fix v1.0.0.3 addresses the following defects:
  
 Issue 1:
 Defect 1146391 - Associate REMS Certified Prescriber to Monitoring
 Frequency Change Request
   This hot fix addresses a problem where change requests do not have
 associated REMS Certified Prescribers. The defect is fixed by adding a
 field for a REMS certified prescriber (requestor) to be associated with
 Monitoring Frequency Change Requests, so that they can review change
 history for a given patient. 
  
 Issue 2: 
 Defect 1146380 - Search and Associate an Existing REMS Certified 
 Prescriber
   This hot fix addresses a problem where users cannot search and associate
 existing REMS Certified Prescribers to monitoring frequency change
 requests. The defect is fixed by adding UI for Users to search and
 associate an existing REMS Certified Prescriber as the requestor on a
 monitoring frequency change request so that they can review a patient's
 monitoring frequency change history.
  
 Issue 3: 
 Defect 1146384 - Add History of Patient Monitoring Frequency Changes
   This hot fix addresses a problem where users cannot see the 
 history of a patients monitoring frequency changes.  The defect is fixed 
 by adding UI where users can review a list of changes made to monitoring 
 frequency for a given patient, so that they can see the patient's 
 treatment progress.
