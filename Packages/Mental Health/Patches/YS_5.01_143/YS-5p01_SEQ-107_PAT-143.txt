 Ticket Overview:
 ================
  
 1.   INC3526338 - SCL9R Missing Answer Choices
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the SCL9R instrument in the Mental Health Assistant, only 
 four (4) answer choices are offered when there should be five (5).  This
 occurs because of an incorrect entry in the MH CHOICETYPES (#601.751)
 file. Specifically, the CHOICETYPE ID `1272 has a SEQUENCE (#1) field
 value of 5 (should be 1) and a CHOICE ID (#2) field value of "Extremely"
 (should be "Not at all").
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Post install routine YS143PIR corrects the field values and resets the
 LAST EDIT DATE (#18) field for the SCL9R instrument in the MH TESTS
 AND SURVEYS (#601.71) file to force the Mental Health Assistant GUI to
 reload the survey with the corrected answers.
