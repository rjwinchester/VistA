Description:
============

 The primary purpose of this patch is to move instruments previously 
 scored in the YS_MHA_AUX DLL to VistA. The scoring changes result in MHA 
 (Mental Health Assistant) scores being reported in Reminder Dialogs and 
 the Health Summary for these instruments properly. The following 
 instruments are now scored in VistA:
  
 Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Consumption            AUDC
 Beck Anxiety Inventory                                           BAI
 Brief Addiction Monitor - Consumption Items                      BAM-C
 Brief Addiction Monitor - Revised                                BAM-R
 Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale - 24                   BASIS-24
 Beck Depression Inventory--Second Edition                        BDI2
 Beck Hopelessness Scale                                          BHS
 Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (previous short name: BSI)       BSS
 Clinical Dementia Rating                                         CDR
 Functional Assessment Staging                                    FAST
 Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Inventory                  ISMI
 Mini-Cog                                                         MINICOG
 NEO Personality Inventory-3                                      NEO-PI-3
 Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-Restructured Form  MMPI-2-RF
 Primary Care PTSD Screen                                         PC PTSD
 Patient Health Questionnaire-2                                   PHQ-2
 Pain Outcomes Questionnaire                                      POQ
 Quality of Life Inventory                                        QOLI
 Short Test of Mental Status                                      STMS
 Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey                              VR-12
 World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0     WHODAS 2
 West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory                  WHYMPI
  
 Additionally, the scoring algorithm was changed so that every instrument 
 score is persistently stored in the MH RESULTS File (#601.92).  Should an 
 instrument need to be rescored for any reason, there has been 
 functionality added to retain previous scores.
  
 The Brief Addiction Monitor (BAM) has been retired.  The BAM-R and BAM-IOP
 should be used instead.
  
 The BSI was renamed to the BSS.  Scoring the instrument was also 
 modified.  Prior to this patch all questions were included in the score, 
 now only questions 1-19 are included in the scoring so the maximum score 
 for the instrument is 38.  The current scoring rule stipulates that if 
 more than 5 questions are not answered the instrument would not be scored
 has been removed.  The instrument will now be scored regardless of how 
 many questions are skipped. Skip logic has been added so that if the 
 response to Question 20 is "I have never attempted suicide" (0), question 
 21 is not asked.  The categories of risk have been removed from the 
 report and the following text has been added:
  
   The BSS is intended to assess thoughts, plans and intent to die by 
   suicide or attempt suicide over the past week.  Total scores can range
   from 0-38. There is no specific cut-off score to classify severity or
   guide patient management, however, increasing scores reflect greater
   risk, and any positive response to any item may reflect the presence of
   suicidal intention and should be investigated further.
   
 The VR-12, question 7 had incorrect responses.  The responses prior to 
 the modification were:
  
 1. All of the time    3. A good bit of the time    5. A little of the time
 2. Most of the time   4. Some of the time          6. None of the time
  
 The correct responses are:
 1. All of the time    3. Some of the time          5. None of the time
 2. Most of the time   4. A little of the time
  
 The responses have been changed to the correct responses.  Any previously 
 administered instrument will have response #3 (A good bit of the time) 
 mapped to response #2 (Most of the time) during the patch install.
   
 Additionally, the scoring algorithm for the VR-12 was modified to 
 consider skipped questions in the administration.
  
 The Beck Depression Inventory--Second Edition (BDI2) results review
 has been changed.  If the response to Item 9 (SUICIDAL THOUGHTS OR 
 WISHES) is 1, 2, or 3 the following statement is added to the report 
 after score:
  
   Responses consistent with the presence of suicidal ideation were 
   endorsed in positive direction (item-9), additional clinical 
   assessment is indicated.
  
 The Brief Addiction Monitor - Revised (BAM-R) was revised to correct a 
 scoring error.  Prior to this patch question 17 was included in the 
 Protective Factors Scale score rather than question 16 resulting in an 
 incorrect scale score. Question 16 is now used in the calculation.
  
 The NEO Personality Inventory-3 (NEO-PI-3) Instrument Results Review was 
 modified to display messages when it appears that the respondent answered 
 the items in a random fashion resulting in an invalid administration.
  
 The West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (WHYMPI) was revised 
 to correct a scoring error.  The Affective Distress Scale did not 
 properly reverse-score the response to question 6 prior to calculating 
 the score and has been corrected. 
  
 The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) Instrument Results Review was 
 modified. The statement that explains if the screening score indicates a 
 positive or negative result was changed. Additionally, the 2 questions 
 were made required.
  
 Currently an example statement is: A score of 4 or more indicates a 
 positive screen. 
  
 The statement has been changed to: The score on this administration is 4, 
 which indicates a positive screen on the Depression Scale over the past 
 two weeks.
  
 Globally for any instrument with skip logic: the skip logic did not work 
 correctly when an instrument was administered using the "One question at 
 a time" function in the Instrument Administrator. If the next to last 
 question should be skipped, MHA did not automatically move to the last 
 question, rather it required the user to click on the 'Next Question' 
 button.  Modifications were made so that the user is prompted for the 
 last question.
  
 Instruments that have a 'checklist' box question such as the Suicide 
 Behavior Report did not display the last choice in the list box.  While a 
 user could select the item, arrow keys had to be used to see the item
 although it was not intuitive to do so.  Modifications were made so that
 all items are visible in a left justified list.

 Patch Installation
 ==================
  
 Pre-installation Overview:
 --------------------------
 In the past, not all mental health instruments had scores recorded in the 
 MH RESULTS file (#601.92).  This patch corrects that by starting a job in 
 the background that will re-score any instruments that do not have
 properly recorded scores.  IMPORTANT NOTE:  This will cause the number of
 records stored in the MH RESULTS file (#601.92) to increase by about
 25%.  Prior to installing the patch, be sure there is enough space for the
 ^YTT global to grow.  At test sites, the ^YTT global grew by about 3%. See
 YS_501_123_IG.pdf for more information.
