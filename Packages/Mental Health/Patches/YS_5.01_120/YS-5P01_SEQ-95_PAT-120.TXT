    Problem
    -------
    In Appendix E of the MHA3 (Mental Health Assistant 3) User Manual are 
    instructions for setting up MHA3 on the CPRS GUI Tools Menu. These 
    instructions are written for the Windows XP OS. They may not work on a 
    workstation running the Windows 7 OS. In the "Name=Command:" field the 
    user enters a set of five parameters to run MHA3 from the CPRS GUI
    Tools Menu.
  
    One of these parameters is called "Entry". The Entry parameter must 
    contain the exact directory path to the MHA3 executable, YS_MHA.exe.
    The directory path will be different between Windows XP OS and Windows
    7 OS. 
  
    In Windows XP the Entry parameter and its directory path are:
    Entry=C:\Prog~1\Vista\YS\MHA3\YS_MHA.exe
  
    In Windows 7 the Entry parameter and its directory path are:
    Entry="C:\Program Files (x86)\Vista\YS\MHA3\YS_MHA.exe"
    The directory path must be enclosed in quotes due to the embedded
    spaces in the directory path.
  
    Appendix E of the MHA3 User Manual is being updated to include the
    exact directory path required for both the Windows XP OS and the
    Windows 7 OS. Refer to the Documentation Retrieval Instructions below
    to get the updated MHA3 User Manual.
  
    Resolution
    ----------
    Modification of the MHA3 User Manual, Appendix E, to use the 
    directory path needed by the Windows 7 OS.
