Subject: RE-INDEX MENTAL HEALTH RESULTS EMERGENCY PATCH

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to repair any anomalies in the indexes of the
 MH ANSWERS (601.85) and MH RESULTS (601.92) files.  Starting with 
 YS*5.01*123, the Mental Health package records all instrument scores in
 VistA.  After installation, sites have seen errors when processing
 Clinical Reminders.  This is usually manifest on the CPRS cover sheet.
 Clinical Reminders that include a Mental Health assessment may show
 "Error" instead of "DUE NOW" in the Due Date column.  Bad pointers in the
 indexes of the MH ANSWERS (601.85) and MH RESULTS (601.92) files are the
 cause of the errors.  When these indexes have bad entries, you may see
 these errors in the error trap:
  
     SI+5^YTQPXRM6
     OLDSCRES+5^YTSCORE
     LOADANSW+20^YTSCORE
  
 Some sites have already manually rebuilt the "AC" indexes in these files
 using VA FileMan.  When the patch is installed, you are asked if you want 
 to skip re-indexing.  Only answer "Yes" if you have already re-indexed the
 files.  Even if you have re-indexed, it will be fine to re-index again.  
 The re-indexing is a queued task that runs in the background.  It can be
 run with users on the system.  In test environments the re-indexing 
 process has taken about 15 minutes.
  
 At the end of re-indexing, a MailMan message is sent to the installer.  
 There is also an option included, YS123 RE-INDEX MONITOR. The option will
 allow you to view the status of the re-indexing.  It will also allow you
 to re-queue a new indexing task, should that ever become necessary.
  
 If you have already installed YS*5.01*123:
   After this patch has been installed and the re-indexing has completed,
   you should stop seeing the errors mentioned above.  There is no need to 
   re-install YS*5.01*123.
  
 If you have not yet installed YS*5.01*123:
   Install this patch prior to installing YS*5.01*123.  The patch will 
   repair the indexes so that you don't see the above errors when
   YS*5.01*123 is installed.

 Back-Out Plan
 -------------
 This patch adds two new routines that exist solely for the purpose of this
 patch.  It does not modify any existing routines, so there is nothing to
 back-out or to restore.
  
 If there is a catastrophic failure in re-indexing, use VA FileMan to
 manually re-index the MH ANSWERS (601.85) and the MH RESULTS (601.92)
 files.
