Subject: PCL-5 UPDATE AND INSTRUMENT SCORING

Category: 
  - Other
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will modify some of the prompts in the PCL-5 instrument to be 
 consistent with the current wording of PCL-5.  The PCL-5 instrument will 
 be activated so that it is available for selection in the Mental Health 
 Assistant (MHA).  The PCLC, PCLM, PCLS, and NEOPI instruments are 
 inactivated.  Also, possible scoring errors for the following instruments
 have been corrected:  MMCI3, MMPI-2-RF, MOCA, MOCA Alt 1, and MOCA Alt 2.
  
 Additionally, the patch provides an interim solution for the problem 
 where instruments with complex scoring algorithms display inaccurate 
 scores in Clinical Reminders and Health Summary.  A filter is added that 
 will prevent selection of these instruments in Clinical Reminders and 
 Health Summary until a VistA based scoring algorithm can be deployed.
