Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_Prod_Overview_Guide_Groups_5_6_7.pdf) posted on the Anonymous
 directory for installation order. This is critical for proper
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the ICD10 Activation Date use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
 systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
 which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research.
  
 The Mental Health module provides computer support for both clinical and 
 administrative patient care activities associated with mental health 
 care. ICD codes are supported within this clinical database package.  
 This patch remediates the presentation and storage of Mental Health data 
 after the ICD-10 Activation Date.
  
 To allow for entry of both ICD-9 and ICD-10 code sets, the Mental Health 
 M code logic has been modified to ask for the DATE/TIME OF DIAGNOSIS 
 before the DSM DIAGNOSIS prompt.  When the DATE/TIME OF DIAGNOSIS is 
 before the ICD-10 Activation Date, the user is presented with an Enter 
 ICD-9 Diagnosis prompt. Otherwise if this date is on or after the ICD-10 
 Activation Date, the user is presented with an Enter ICD-10 Diagnosis 
 prompt.  If the user is presented with a prompt to enter an ICD-10 
 Diagnosis, the new ICD-10 Diagnosis Search Functionality is available. 
  
 The Print Diagnoses Sort by Diagnosis and Print DXLS History reports have 
 both been modified to also display ICD10 codes.
  
 Integration Control Registration (ICR #5924) was created to update the 
 DESCRIPTION for the DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS - MENTAL HEALTH File (#627.8) to 
 change the occurrences of 'ICD9' to 'ICD DESCRIPTION.' ICR #5924 is a 
 private agreement with FileMan as the custodial package and Mental  
 Health as the subscribing  package.
