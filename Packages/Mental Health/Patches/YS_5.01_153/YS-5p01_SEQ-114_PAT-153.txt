Subject: National Clozapine Registry (NCR) version 1.0 Hot Fix

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

  
 The purpose of this Mental Health patch is to provide information 
 regarding a hot fix for version 1.0 of the National Clozapine Registry
 (NCR) graphical user interface (GUI).  The NCR is maintained by the
 National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC).  The NCCC is responsible
 for VA's compliance with the clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
 Strategy (REMS), which was mandated by the Food and Drug Administration
 (FDA) for tracking clozapine patients.
  
 The NCR v1.0 GUI is only available to staff at the NCCC.  The software 
 for this hot fix will be hosted in the VA cloud servers.  No site
 involvement is needed and there are no components added to VistA.  This
 patch provides the documentation of the changes made to this cloud based
 application.
  
 This hot fix addresses a problem where Patient records are not being 
 copied from the application, before and after Director Reviews.  This was
 identified when Patient fields were not displaying in the Director 
 Reviews page. The fix also addresses the same concern in a separate
 location where the REMS ID needs to be enterable on a Patient record
 before it is sent to the Director for review.  The defect is fixed by 
 adding additional code to force the saving of a Patient record before it
 is sent to the Director for review, so that there is always a patient
 record in the database for every application.
