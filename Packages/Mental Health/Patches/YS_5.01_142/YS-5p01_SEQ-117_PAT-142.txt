Associated patches: (v)YS*5.01*139 <<= must be installed BEFORE `YS*5.01*142'

Subject: MHA SCALE FIXES AND REPORT UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch updates the following Mental Health instruments:
  
 AIMS (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale)
   A disclaimer is no longer added when the progress note text is
   generated.
  
 C-SSRS (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale)
   A Key Indicator is now added if the response to question 3 is 'Yes'.
  
 MMPI-2-RF (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 - Restructured 
 Form)
   The T-score for the EID (Emotional/Internalizing Dysfunction) scale 
   is now correct.
   The score for the PSYC-r (Psychoticism-Revised) scale now accounts for 
   the value of question 216.
  
 QOLI (Quality of Life Inventory)
   A scoring error originally introduced in YS*5.01*139 is corrected.
  
 If the administration of an instrument with many scales preceded an
 instrument with fewer scales during a session, additional scales were
 sometimes carried over to the second instrument.  This was visible in the
 Health Summary component and TIU objects.  It could also affect the
 display of Special Reports.  This is corrected with this patch.  
 Additionally, the patch checks previous administrations to make sure each
 administration has only the correct scales associated.
  
 Additional record locks were added to the PSYCH INSTRUMENT PATIENT file 
 (#601.2) to reduce the likelihood of errors when generating a report for a
 legacy instrument.

 Patch Installation
 ==================
  
 NOTE:  In step 3b, after loading the patch, if you choose to use the
 option "Compare Transport Global to Current System" and select the choice
 "Second line of Routines only", a warning may appear under the routine,
 YTQAPI2B:
  
   *** WARNING, you are missing one or more Patches ***.
  
 This warning is expected and may be safely ignored.  It appears because 
 the previous version of the routine omitted 136 in the patch list on the 
 2nd line.  This patch is correcting that omission.
  
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation time will
 be less than 5 minutes.
  
  1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
     INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
  2. Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
     [XPD MAIN]: 
          Edits and Distribution ...

     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
         will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
         this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
         patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
         in the transport global.
  
  4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
     YS*5.01*142.
     a.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the 
         install? NO//", answer NO.
