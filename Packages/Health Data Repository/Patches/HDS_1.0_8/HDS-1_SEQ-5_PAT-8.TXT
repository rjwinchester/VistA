Subject: HDR 3.15 release

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 HDR Release 3.15, VIP Build 1 includes enhancements to the Home 
 Telehealth (HTH) client to provide census write modifications, validation 
 and handling of census activity reports and patient satisfaction survey 
 titles, and enhancements to the Fix the Phones (FtP) client to support 
 return of additional VistA User detail including the Internal Entry 
 Number (IEN) and logging FtP access to sensitive patients.
  
 The HTH client supports the Veterans in their homes with biometric 
 monitoring and measurement technologies to help maintain their 
 independent living capability, reduce hospital admissions, and improve 
 health outcomes. Each week, each vendor submits patient-specific data to 
 HDR that is required to monitor and manage the program. The program 
 office requires this individual patient data to enable the VA to manage 
 the program appropriately and use an accurate and timely Average Daily 
 Census report generated by the VA. HDR provides HTH with Census data for 
 reporting purposes.
  
 The FtP client leverages the capabilities of HDR and its services to 
 retrieve and return Veteran data from multiple sources to a single 
 desktop view - a user interface defined and designed by FtP. Their access 
 to multiple sources of Veteran data in VistA and DoD is through the HDR 
 services provided in the backend system which gathers and aggregates 
 data. 
  
 The deployment date for HDR 3.15 is scheduled Dec 16, 2016 by the AITC.
