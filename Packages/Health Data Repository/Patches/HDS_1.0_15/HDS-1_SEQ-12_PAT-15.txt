Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 HDR Release 3.19, VIP Build 5.0 includes the following enhancements:
   Support for Census Activity Reports for the Home Telehealth (HTH) 
         client
   Support for Patient Satisfaction Surveys (version 2.0) in 
         distribution of surveys reports and survey trends for the HTH 
         client 
   Support for OneVA Pharmacy reads to improve Read response times 
   Support for Identity Access Management / Single Sign-on Internal 
         (IAM/SSOi) Phase II on HDR service interfaces with expansion to 
         CDS, FPDS and pathways services that directly read from VistA
   Support for additional Read access for the VAMC Call Center 
         Modernization (VCCM) client
   Support for implementing Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource 
         (FHIR) payload format limited to clinical domains for 
         Appointments and Allergies (Intolerance Conditions and 
         Assessments) reads
   Support for Vital Signs writes from HTH to the HDR database
  
 The HTH client supports the Veterans in their homes with biometric  
  
 monitoring and measurement technologies to help maintain their 
 independent living capability, reduce hospital admissions, and improve 
 health outcomes and writes results to the HDR database.
  
 The OneVA Pharmacy client uses the HDR Clinical Data Service (CDS) to 
 read outpatient pharmacy medications in the HDR, through the VA 
 Enterprise Service Bus (VA ESB). 
  
 IAM/SSOi provides the first phase capability to verify the Secure 
 Assertion Markup Language (SAML 2.0) token against VistA through HDRDAT.
  
 The VCCM client reads VistA and DoD data via HDR services. HDR supports 
 the VCCM client by providing access to multiple VCCM-desired domains via 
 HDR services to their user interface. 
  
 FHIR is being implemented as an additional option as a VA enterprise-
 supported data format. FHIR will be accommodated only as transformation 
 of VIM payload when a flag requesting FHIR payload is specified on the 
 existing CDS interface.
  
 The deployment date for HDR 3.19 is scheduled December 19, 2017 by the 
 AITC.
