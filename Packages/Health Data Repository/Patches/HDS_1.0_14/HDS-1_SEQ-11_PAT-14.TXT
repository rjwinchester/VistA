 eCrCl (creatinine clearance)

 The HTH client supports the Veterans in their homes with biometric 
 monitoring and measurement technologies to help maintain their 
 independent living capability, reduce hospital admissions, and improve 
 health outcomes and writes results to the HDR database.
  
 The MHV client supports the Veteran by retrieving VistA and DoD clinical 
 data for to be displayed in support of the MHV project.
  
 The VCCM client reads VistA and DoD data via HDR services. HDR supports 
 the VCCM client by providing access to multiple VCCM-desired domains via 
 HDR services to their user interface. 
  
 The OneVA Pharmacy client uses the HDR Clinical Data Service (CDS) to 
 read outpatient pharmacy medications in the HDR, through the VA 
 Enterprise Service Bus (VA ESB). 
  
 IAM/SSOi provides the first phase capability to verify the Secure 
 Assertion Markup Language (SAML 2.0) token against VistA through HDRDAT.
  
  
 The deployment date for HDR 3.18 is scheduled September 19, 2017 by the
