                    an auto decrease that is taking place
  
 PROBLEM: 
 --------
 The 2017 BILLING THRESHOLDS file (#354.3) values need to be re-instated.
  
 RESOLUTION:
 -----------
 Post Install routine IB20P620 will update the new pension threshold 
 values. The Technical section below contains a list of the rates, 
 which may also be found in VHA FACT SHEET titled MEANS TEST AND 
 GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST AND MAXIMUM ANNUAL RATES OF PENSION FOR
 CALENDAR YEAR 2017. If a site has already entered the values manually,
 the record will be overwritten with the national update.
  
 The new pension rates for Calendar Year 2017 (with an effective date of
 12/1/16) are defined in VHA FACT SHEET titled MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-
 BASED MEANS TEST AND MAXIMUM ANNUAL RATES OF PENSION FOR CALENDAR YEAR 
 2017 as:
   
  *   $ 12,907 for a single veteran without dependents
  *   $ 16,902 for a veteran with 1 dependent
  *   An additional $ 2,205 for each additional dependent beyond 1 
      dependent
   
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ---------- 
 File BILLING THRESHOLDS (#354.3) is updated with a new record.  The 
 values are as follows: 
   .01  DATE                        = 3161201 (internal form for 12/01/2016)
   .02  TYPE                        = 1       (for BASIC PENSION)
   .03  BASE RATE FOR VETERAN       = 12907
   .04  BASE RATE WITH 1 DEPENDENT  = 16902
   .05  BASE RATE WITH 2 DEPENDENTS = 19107
   .06  BASE RATE WITH 3 DEPENDENTS = 21312
   .07  BASE RATE WITH 4 DEPENDENTS = 23517
   .08  BASE RATE WITH 5 DEPENDENTS = 25722
