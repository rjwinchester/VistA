Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_Prod_Overview_Guide_Group_8A.pdf) posted on the Anonymous.Software 
 directory for installation order. This is critical for proper 
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
                  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the implementation date, will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
 systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
 which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research.
  
  
 This patch updates Integrated Billing (IB) to accommodate ICD-10 code 
 versions when activated.  Integrated Billing (IB) will expand the ICD code 
 sets used to include both ICD-9 and ICD-10.  In each case where the ICD-9 
 code sets are currently used the new ICD-10 codes set will be available 
 when activated.  The following modifications are required for Integrated 
 Billing (IB) to be compliant.   In all the following cases when a date is 
 concerned it is relative to the ICD-10 Activation Date.
  
 The short name or description of both Diagnosis and Procedures has been 
 extended from 30 characters to 60 characters in ICD-10.  Display screens 
 throughout IB have been modified to display an expanded Code description, 
 where possible.  In many cases the full expanded 60 character descriptions 
 could not be used due to space limitations.
                  
 Most searches for ICD codes no longer allow a view of the entire list of 
 codes, starting at the first code, using '?'.  This is now only available 
 if Inactive Codes are also viewed as in the Bill Diagnosis entry/edit.  
 Since the list of ICD codes is now so large viewing the entire list takes 
 some time.
                  
 Both ICD-9 and ICD-10 Diagnosis and Procedure codes will be available 
 within Integrated Billing, based on the date of service and the ICD-10 
 activation date.
                  
                  
 Bill Coding Version
 -------------------
 The Bill Statement Covers To Date will determine the ICD code version 
 allowed on the bill.  Each bill must be coded in either ICD-9 or ICD-10.
 -  ICD-9 codes if the Statement To Date is before the ICD-10 activation
 -  ICD-10 codes if the Statement To Date is on/after the ICD-10 activation
                  
 The ICD Diagnosis and ICD Procedures on a bill must be consistent and part 
 of the same coding version.  A new Bill Edit Check will enforce coding 
 version consistency.
                  
 Bill Inpatient Timeframe
 ------------------------
 An inpatient bill will be allowed to span the ICD-10 activation date.  
 For Inpatient stays that span the ICD-10 activation date a bill coded in 
 ICD-10 may cover care before the activation date.
                  
 Bill Outpatient Timeframe
 -------------------------
 An Outpatient bill may not span the ICD-10 Activation Date.  
                  
 -  When creating an Outpatient bill and the Statement From Date entered is 
    before the ICD-10 activation date the default for the Statement To Date 
    will be one day before the activation date.
                  
 -  When creating an Outpatient bill and the Statement From Date entered is 
    before the ICD-10 activation date then a Statement To Date after the 
    activation date will not be allowed.
                  
 -  When editing Outpatient bill dates on Screen 7 the Statement From Date 
    and Statement To Date will not be allowed to span the ICD-10 
    activation date.
                  
 -  An additional edit check error has been added if the Statement From Date 
    and Statement To Date span the ICD-10 activation date.
                  
 Bill Enter/Edit of Diagnosis and Procedures
 -------------------------------------------
 On a Bill the look up and selection of ICD Diagnosis and Procedures has 
 been updated to accommodate the two ICD coding versions: ICD-9 and ICD-10.
                  
 A bill should not have both ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes.
                  
 For both ICD Diagnosis and ICD Procedures the Statement To Date or end 
 date of the bill will determine which set of codes are available on the 
 bill.  Bills with a Statement To Date less than the ICD-10 activation date 
 will allow ICD-9 codes.  Bills with a Statement To Date on or after the 
 ICD-10 activation date will allow ICD-10 codes.
                  
 When certain Diagnosis are displayed for selection on a bill the inactive 
 codes are displayed but not allowed to be placed on the bill.  In these 
 cases active and inactive codes of the coding version applicable to the 
 bill will be displayed.
                  
 -  Bill Diagnosis on Screen 4 for Inpatient and Screen 5 for Outpatient.
 -  Patient Reason for Visit on Screen 10 for Outpatient UB04.
                  
 The short name or description of both Diagnosis and Procedures has been 
 extended from 30 characters to 60 characters in ICD-10.  The display of 
 these names has been lengthened to the extent available on the screens.
                  
 External Cause of Injury codes ICD-9 began with E as the first character.
 External Cause of Injury codes ICD-10 begin with V, W, X, or Y.
 -  Entry of External Cause of Injury (E) codes is limited to 3 in ICD-9.  
 -  There is no restriction on the number of codes in ICD-10 for either  
    E codes or the V, W, X or Y External Cause of Injury codes.
                  
 Bill Charge DRG Calculation
 ---------------------------
 The calculation of the DRG used for charges on Inpatient Institutional 
 bills has been updated. This DRG is based on the Movement data in PTF and 
 is displayed under each movement Diagnosis on the Screen 4 PTF Diagnosis.
                  
 -  The Present on Admission (POA) indicator assigned to a Diagnosis in PTF 
    will be included in the calculation.
                  
 -  The DRG calculation will be based on the code version of the
    Diagnosis assigned to the movement.  Inpatient bills that span the 
    ICD-10 activation date may have ICD-10 codes assigned for movements 
    before the ICD-10 activation.  In this case the DRG calculation will be 
    based on ICD-10 although the movement date is within the ICD-9 
    timeframe.
                  
 Bill Procedure Coding Method
 ----------------------------
 The BILL/CLAIMS PROCEDURE CODING METHOD (#399,.09) has been modified from 
 ICD-9-CM to ICD. This change affects both the field and the display on 
 Screen 4 and Screen 5 of Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING 
 INFO] option.
                  
 Bill Edit Checks
 ----------------
 Several Bill Edit Checks have been modified or added primarily due to 
 changes in the definitions of ICD-10 Diagnosis.  Several of these coding 
 rules being checked are based on a type of diagnosis that is defined by 
 the first character of the code.  With the transition to ICD-10 the 
 character identifying the type has changed in some cases.  For example the 
 External Cause of Injury codes.  
    ICD-9 External Cause of Injury codes first character is an E
    ICD-10 External Cause of Injury codes first character is V, W, X, or Y
                  
 The result is the following updates to the Bill Edit Checks differentiated 
 by the code version:
                  
 -  Principle Diagnosis cannot begin with an E code for ICD-9
 -  Principle Diagnosis cannot begin with a V, W, X, or Y code for ICD-10
                  
 -  Inpatient Principle Diagnosis begins with a V code warning for ICD-9
 -  Inpatient Principle Diagnosis begins with a Z code warning for ICD-10
                  
 -  More than 3 E codes on a bill warning for ICD-9
    Note there is no corresponding limit on the number of V, W, X or Y 
    codes in ICD-10
                  
 -  Pregnancy Diagnosis on the bill with no corresponding Occurrence Code 
    10 Last Menstrual Period error, the determination of Pregnancy code 
    is updated for code version:
    Diagnosis in ICD-9:  V22*-V24*, V27*-V28*, 630*-677
    Diagnosis in ICD-10: O00.*-O9A.*, Z34.*-Z36.*, Z37.*-Z39.*, Z3A.*
                  
 -  An Outpatient bill's Statement Dates cannot span the ICD-10 activation.
    There is no corresponding limit on Inpatient bills.  Inpatient bills 
    may span the ICD-10 activation date.
                  
 -  The code version of all ICD codes on the bill must match the code 
    version defined by the Statement To Date, either ICD-9 or ICD-10.  
    This includes the ICD codes in the following fields:
         Bill Diagnosis (screens 4/5)
         Admitting Diagnosis (screen 10), Inpatient
         Patient Reason for Visit Diagnosis (screen 10, Outpatient)
         Bill Procedures (screens 4/5)
                  
 Default Prescription Diagnosis Site Parameter
 ---------------------------------------------
 A site parameter exists to provide a Default Diagnosis that is 
 automatically added to a bill when a Prescription is added to the bill.  
 This capability is updated to accommodate both an ICD-9 and ICD-10 
 Diagnosis.
                  
 -  The existing IB SITE PARAMETERS, DEFAULT RX REFILL DX (#350.9, 1.29) 
    will remain available for the ICD-9 version Diagnosis.  
                  
 -  A new IB SITE PARAMETERS field DEFAULT RX REFILL DX ICD-10 
    (#350.9, 7.05) is created for the ICD-10 version of the Diagnosis.
    When this patch is installed this new field will be set to a default 
    value of Z76.0 - Encounter for issue of repeat prescription
                  
 One of the two Default Rx Diagnosis will be viewable and editable based on 
 date in the MCCR Site Parameter Display/Edit [IBJ MCCR SITE PARAMETERS] 
 option, IB Site Parameter Screen.
                  
 When editing a bill in Enter/Edit Billing Information the Default 
 Diagnosis automatically added to a bill when a prescription is added will 
 be determined based on the bill Statement To Date.  The ICD-10 Default 
 Diagnosis will be automatically added to bills with a Statement To Date on 
 or after the ICD-10 Activation date.
                  
 Form Output Extract - IB 837 Transmission
 -------------------------------------------
 The EDI Extract of a claim has been updated to be ICD-10 compliant.
 The Diagnosis and Procedure Qualifiers that identify the codes on the EDI 
 extracts have been updated to distinguish between ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes.  
 Note the External Cause of Injury Diagnosis codes are uniquely identified 
 on the UB04 form.  The following are the types of diagnosis and procedures 
 extracted and their corresponding Qualifier.
                  
 -  DC1-Principle Diagnosis (not External Cause of Injury) ICD-9 is BK
 -  DC1-Principle Diagnosis (not External Cause of Injury) ICD-10 is ABK
                  
 -  DC1-Diagnosis (not Principle/External Cause of Injury-UB) ICD-9 is BF
 -  DC1-Diagnosis (not Principle/External Cause of Injury-UB) ICD-10 is ABF
                  
 -  DC1-Diagnosis External Cause of Injury (E) on UB04 ICD-9 is BN
 -  DC1-Diagnosis External Cause of Injury (V,X,W,Y) on UB04 ICD-10 ABN
                  
 -  DC1-Diagnosis External Cause of Injury (E) on CMS ICD-9 is BF
 -  DC1-Diagnosis External Cause of Injury (V,X,W,Y) on CMS ICD-10 is ABF
                  
 -  PC1-Principle Procedure ICD-9 is BR
 -  PC1-Principle Procedure ICD-10 is BBR
                  
 -  PC1-Procedure (not Principle) ICD-9 is BQ
 -  PC1-Procedure (not Principle) ICD-10 is BBQ
                  
 -  CLIA-Admitting Diagnosis (Inpatient) ICD-9 is BJ
 -  CL1A-Admitting Diagnosis (Inpatient) ICD-10 is ABJ
                  
 -  CL1A-Patient Reason for Visit (UB04 - Outpatient) ICD-9 is PR
 -  CL1A-Patient Reason for Visit (UB04 - Outpatient) ICD-10 is APR
                  
 Note this patch only updates the EDI Extract for the Code Qualifiers. 
 eClaims has already updated the EDI Extract for the extended Code length, 
 where needed.
                  
 Form Output Extract - UB-04 Locally Printed
 -------------------------------------------
 The ICD-10 Diagnosis code is 8 characters with a decimal, however the 
 printed UB-04 allows only 7 characters for the Diagnosis.  The decimal in 
 the Diagnosis code is not required to print since it is implied.  
 Therefore the decimal will be removed from all Diagnosis printed on a 
 bill, allowing the Diagnosis to fit correctly in the UB-04 form locators:
    FL 67     - Principle Diagnosis
    FL 67A-Q  - Other Diagnosis
    FL 69     - Admitting Diagnosis (Inpatient)
    FL 70a-c  - Patient Reason for Visit (Outpatient)
    FL 72a-c  - External Cause of Injury (ECI) codes
                  
 The External Cause of Injury (ECI) section (FL 72a-c) is no longer used.  
 Therefore the ICD-10 ECI codes (V, W, X, Y codes) will be printed with the 
 other Bill Diagnosis in Form Locators 67A-Q.
                  
 Third Party Joint Inquiry
 -------------------------
 The short name or description of both Diagnosis and Procedures has been 
 extended from 30 characters to 60 characters in ICD-10.  The TPJI Bill 
 Procedure and Bill Diagnosis Screens have been update to display the 
 entire ICD code description.
                  
 Claims Tracking
 ---------------
 The primary updates required for Claims Tracking were to displays and the 
 addition of the Present On Admission indicator.
                  
 -  The CLAIMS TRACKING, ADMITTING REASON (ICD) (#356, .3) name was changed 
    to the more generic, ICD from ICD-9.
                  
 -  The Patients Admitting Movements Admitting Diagnosis is displayed on 
    both the Claims Tracking Extended screen and the Claims Tracking 
    Appeal/Denial Extended screen.  However if the appeal/denial review 
    date was after the patient was discharged the Admitting Diagnosis 
    was not found or displayed on the Appeal/Denial Extended screen.  This 
    has been corrected.
                  
 The Inpatient Diagnosis and Procedures and DRG calculation have been 
 updated for ICD-10.  The Diagnosis Update (DU) and Procedure Update (PU) 
 actions available to enter codes to calculate an DRG for Inpatient stays:
                  
 -  The Inpatient Diagnosis selection display of active and inactive codes 
    will be limited to the coding version applicable to the admission 
    date of the stay.
                  
 -  An new INPATIENT DIAGNOSIS, POA INDICATOR (#356.9, .05) has been added 
    with the following selections to indicate if the diagnosis related 
    condition was present when the patient was admitted:
    Y = Present at the time of inpatient admission
    N = Not present at the time of inpatient admission 
    U = Documentation is insufficient to determine if condition was present 
    W = Provider is unable to clinically determine if condition was present
    This POA indicator will default to Yes when a Diagnosis is entered.
                  
 -  Within the Update actions the list of Diagnosis (DU) has been updated 
    to display the code version and the POA indicator.
                  
 -  Within the Update actions the list of Procedure (PU) has been updated 
    to display the code version.
                  
 -  The DRG calculation has been updated to include the new POA Indicator.
                  
                  
 Technical Description:
 ======================
                  
 In Claims Tracking two API's that get Outpatient encounter data had been 
 retired but were still being used:  SDCO3 (#403) and SDCO4 (#404).  These 
 two API's have been replaced by the supported API SDOE (#2546).  The 
 Expanded Claims Tracking Screen and Inquire to Claims Tracking report 
 use these APIs, but the API update results in no functional change.
                  
 ICD API (#3990) ICDCODE previously used to get ICD Diagnosis and Procedure 
 data is being retired and replaced by the new ICD API (#5747) ICDEX.
 All instances in IB of the use of ICDCODE have been replaced by ICDEX.
                  
 Throughout IB the functions in the utility IBACSV are used to get the data 
 on the various codes, including ICD Diagnosis and Procedures.  Therefore 
 many of the changes necessary for conversion to ICD-10 were accomplished 
 by updating the API calls in this utility.
                  
 The IB ERROR (#350.8) codes have been updated in the post-init:
 -  IB071:  The existing IB NO DX Error code (IB071) message updated, 
            ICD-9 replaced with ICD: A claim must contain an ICD diagnosis.
 -  IB354:  A new IB354 Error Code has been added: Statement Covers To date 
            cannot span into ICD-10 effective period.
 -  IB355:  A new IB355 Error Code has been added: The Principal (first-
            entered) diagnosis cannot begin with a V, W, X or Y.
 -  IB356:  A new IB356 Error Code has been added: ICD Code Set Version 
            does not correspond to Statement Covers To Date.
                  
 The following IB FORM FIELD CONTENT (#364.7) entry's Format Code (1) have 
 been modified.  These entries are deleted in the pre-init and re-added 
 during the install to ensure an accurate update.

 Note the Bill Diagnosis Qualifiers BN/ABN, BF/ABF, BK/ABK have also 
 changed however the related Form Field entry #41 - DC1 Diagnosis Code 
 calls a procedure to determine the Diagnosis Qualifiers.  This procedure 
 has been updated so entry #41 has not changed and does not need to be 
 exported (ID1^IBCEF2).
                  
 Two Input Templates are re-compiled in the post-init.  The templates did 
 not change but a field edited within templates did change:  BILL/CLAIMS 
 PROCEDURE CODING METHOD (#399,.09).  Therefore the templates are not 
 exported but re-compiled:
 -  IB SCREEN4 - Enter/Edit of Inpatient Billing information
 -  IB SCREEN5 - Enter/Edit of Outpatient Billing Information
                  
 The following options have been updated with this patch:

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ------------------------------------- 
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
 patch is available.
                  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/
                  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as follows:
                  
  Albany         ftp.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Hines          ftp.domain.ext   <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
