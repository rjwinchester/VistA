 **************************************************************************
                    
 For Inpatient care, the number of allowable Diagnosis and Procedure codes 
 is being expanded in the Patient Treatment File (PTF) with DG*5.3*884.  
 The following records in PTF are being expanded to allow up to 25 codes:  
 Movement Diagnosis (501), Discharge Diagnosis (701), Surgical Episode 
 Procedures (401) and Non-O/R Episode Procedures (601).
                    
 This patch IB*2*522 will update the Inpatient Bill/Claim to accommodate 
 the expanded number of Diagnosis and Procedure codes available in PTF.  
                    
                    
 A. Inpatient Bill/Claims Diagnosis:
 -----------------------------------
 Screen 4 option 3 of Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] 
 has been updated to display and allow selection of all Diagnosis in the 
 PTF record within the date range of the bill.  This is up to 25 Diagnosis 
 for each Movement (501) and the Discharge (701). 
                    
 The Present on Admission (POA) indicator associated with any selected PTF 
 Diagnosis will be also added to the bill.  The display of PTF Diagnosis 
 will include the POA, if present in PTF.
                    
 Beginning with ICD-10 bills the Present on Admission (POA) indicator 
 entered in the DSS Encoder will no longer be added to a bill.  For ICD-10 
 bills the Diagnosis POA will be available in PTF where it will be accessed 
 for placement on the bill.
                    
 Depending on the number of PTF Movements associated with the bill, the 
 display and selection of Movement Diagnosis identifiers will now include 
 both upper and lower case alpha characters (A-Z and a-z), with X/x being 
 reserved for the Discharge.  Previously only upper case alpha characters 
 were selectable.
                    
 B.  Inpatient Bill/Claims Procedures:
 -------------------------------------
 Screen 4 option 4 of Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] 
 has been updated to display and allow selection of all Procedures in the 
 PTF record within the date range of the bill.  This is up to 25 ICD 
 Procedures for each Surgical (401) and Non-O/R (601) Episode.
                    
 It is possible that the same procedure may be completed multiple times on 
 the same date.  These duplicate ICD procedures will be displayed in the 
 list of PTF ICD procedures as separate line items.  If a duplicate ICD 
 procedure is selected by the preceding indicator then these duplicates 
 will be added to the bill.
                    
 The display of PTF Surgical (401) and Non-O/R (601) ICD Procedures has 
 been updated to display a '*' before each PTF ICD procedure that matches 
 a procedure and date already assigned to the bill.
                    
 The display and selection of the PTF Professional Services (801) has also 
 been expanded to all CPT/HCPCS codes assigned within the bill date range.  
 Previously a maximum of 5 CPT/HCPCS were displayed for each Professional 
 Service although more than 5 may have been entered in PTF.  
                    
 The display of the PTF Professional Services (801) will now include the 
 Quantity of the procedure performed if it is more than 1.
                    
 Depending on the number of PTF Procedure Episodes associated with the bill, 
 the display and selection of Procedure Episode identifiers will now 
 include both upper and lower case alpha characters (A-Z and a-z).  
 Previously only upper case alpha characters were selectable.
                    
 C.  Bill Charge Calculation: 
 ----------------------------
 For Inpatient Facility bill charges, the calculation of the DRG has been 
 modified to use all the PTF Diagnosis and Procedure codes within the 
 appropriate date range.
                    
 D.  Third Party Autobiller:
 ---------------------------
 Inpatient bills created by the Third Party Autobiller will add all the PTF 
 Diagnosis, POA, and Procedure codes within the bill date range.
                    
                    
 Technical Description:
 ======================
                    
 IB*2*522 is dependent on DG*5.3*884 ICD-10 Patient Treatment File 
 Modifications which adds the new PTF Diagnosis, POA, and Procedure fields.
                    
 Integrated Billing has subscribed to the Registration ICR #6130 to access 
 these new PTF fields.
                    
 The following option has been updated with this patch:
 -  Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO]
                    
 There is no Pre or Post Installation routine or modifications associated 
 with this patch.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ----------------------------
                    
 1.  INC000001243424  Billing Screen 10, section 3 Attending Provider Name 
                      missing
                    
 Problem:  
 --------
 Attending provider is not being automatically added to Billing screen 10, 
 Section 3 when a bill is created by the AutoBiller and the provider has a 
 valid NPI.  The Third Party AutoBiller had been modified to only add the 
 Attending provider if that provider had a valid NPI.  However the check 
 for NPI was using the wrong field for the provider resulting in the NPI 
 never being found and therefore the AutoBiller never added the Attending 
 Provider to the bill. 
                    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The software was updated to correctly identify the Attending provider's 
 NPI.  The Third Party AutoBiller will add the Attending Provider to a bill 
 it creates if that provider has a valid NPI.  The Attending provider is 
 then viewable on Screen 10, section 3 of Enter/Edit Billing Information 
 [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] option.
