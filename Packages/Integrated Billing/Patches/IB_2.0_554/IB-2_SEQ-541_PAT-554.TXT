 IMPORTANT INSTALLATION NOTE:
 ----------------------------
 There are three patches associated with this project - PRCA*4.5*310,
 IB*2.0*554 and FB*3.5*163. All three patches are to be installed as 
 Packman files.  There is no bundle.
  
 The three patches incorporated code from the following concurrent 
 development and, as such, the following patches MUST be installed prior to
 this project:
 1.)  IB*2.0*528
 2.)  IB*2.0*530 (and associated patches PRCA*4.5*303 - BUNDLED, IB*2.0*529
      and PRCA*4.5*304 - STANDALONE)
 3.)  FB*3.5*154 (and associated FBCS patch DSIF*3.2*38)
 4.)  FB*3.5*166
  
 The three patches for this project MUST be installed in this order:
 1.)  PRCA*4.5*310
 2.)  IB*2.0*554
 3.)  FB*3.5*163
  
 Description
 -----------
 The Chief Business Office (CBO) is requesting system enhancements to
 The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) Integrated Billing (IB), Accounts Receivable (AR), and Fee
 Basis (FB) software modules that would allow segregating all billing and
 collection activities for Non-Department of Veterans Affairs (Non-VA)
 Care Third Party Insurance carriers' reimbursement.
  
 Current Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) Third Party billing and
 collections applications in the VistA information system do not
 segregate the Non-VA care claims from those claims for service rendered
 at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) healthcare facilities. This
 makes it difficult to determine whether all monies due VA for Non-VA
 care services are being billed and collected from Third Party
 insurance carriers, where applicable.  The current process is a resource
 intensive, manual process with no assurance that all applicable
 Non-VA charges have been billed and collected.
  
 This project will improve the transfer of data from VistA Fee
 to Integrated Billing. It will record Non-VA revenue in a new  
 fund 5287-13 to allow separate tracking of these revenues.
  
 A new third party rate type Fee Reimbursable Insurance has been created
 to associate the revenues to the new fund. The patch makes the following
 changes and enhancements:
  
 A new Copays on Hold List Manager screen will display the copays that
 are on hold based on the filters selected by the user.  This will
 ease processing copays on hold.  Functionality has also been added to
 release a copay when the patient does not have billable insurance as
 well as a copay on hold when the buffer file entry has been processed. 
  
 The Third Party Follow Up and Trend reports have been modified to display
 the new rate type.
  
 Concurrent Development / Dependencies:
 --------------------------------------
 Patch IB*2.0*554 is dependent upon enhancements in FB*3.5*154 (Separation 
 of Duties).  FB*3.5*154 is being released with DSIF*3.2*38 (Separation of
 Duties), DSIF*3.2*50 (AMC Defect Repair) and FB*3.5*172 (Security Keys
 for Separation of Duties).
  
 There was coordination with the following patches, whereby code from the
 following patches was incorporated into IB*2.0*554.  The following 
 patches must be installed prior to IB*2.0*554:
  
 IB*2.0*528 (^IBCNBAR, ^IBCNSM)
  
 IB*2.0*530 (^IBJDF11)
