 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 The components sent with this IB*2.0*611 patch have been included in the 
 HOST File DG_53_P949.KID.  Please follow the instructions listed in the 
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS section of the patch description for patch 
 DG*5.3*949.
    
 NOTE: Please bear in mind items below for install.
   
  1.  During installation, the BILLING EXEMPTIONS file (#354.1) will be
      checked for medication co-payment exemptions based on prior
      thresholds. If they exist, the installer will be prompted to
      UPDATE AND PRINT the exemptions report since the exemption status may
      change due to the new rates.
    
      Press <Enter> to accept the default value of Update & Print. At the
      DEVICE prompt you must enter a valid print device. An entry is 
      required and the HOME device is not allowed; neither are the
      P-Message device or Spooler device (this will abort the install). You
      MUST choose a valid printer. You need not queue the report since the
      patch will do so automatically.
