  ****************************************************************
                NOTICE!!!!!  7 DAYS COMPLIANCE DATE
  ****************************************************************
  
  
  
  *****************************************************************
                         WARNING!!!!
  
   If this patch, IB*2.0*618, has already been installed,
  
  
      ******************* DO NOT RE-INSTALL *********************
  
   This pertains to ALL sites, but with special attention to the 3
   test sites listed below:
    
  
     Edward J Hines VA Hospital (Chicago, IL) - Station 578
     Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center (Richmond, VA) 
        - Station 652 
     Central Alabama Veterans Healthcare System (Montgomery, AL) 
        - Station 619
  
   Doing so will cause the duplication of entries into the IB ACTION
   TYPE (350.1), RATE TYPE (399.3), IB ACTION CHARGES (350.2), and/or
   the RATE SCHEDULE (363) files, which would prevent the INTEGRATED
   BILLING Package and ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES packages from working
   correctly.

  Description
  ============
  The Office of Community Care (OCC) is requesting system enhancements to 
  the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
  (VistA) Integrated Billing (IB), Accounts Receivable (AR), and Fee 
  Basis (FB) software modules that would allow segregating all billing
  and collection activities for Non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
  Care Third Party Insurance carriers' reimbursement.
  
  The primary goal of this enhancement is to increase timeliness and
  collections of billable Non-Veterans Affairs (VA) care services.
  Enhancements to existing VistA IB, AR, and Fee software applications
  would allow for increased efficiency in workflow processes leading to
  best practices that would ultimately be reflected in improved customer
  service to our Veteran population.
  
  The second goal of this enhancement is to prepare the IB and AR software 
  modules for the implementation of the changes required by the Maintaining
  Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks 
  (MISSION) Act.
   
  In order to meet these goals, this patch:
  
  1. Creates 19 new entries in the Rate Type File (#399.3).
  
    - Adds options for billers to choose Community Care (CC), Community
      Care Network (CCN) or Choice for No-Fault Auto, Reimbursable 
      Insurance, Tort Feasor & Worker's Comp. Also adds options for
      Disability Evaluations, Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI), Traumatic Brain
      Injuries (TBI), Blind Rehabilitation and TriCare Dental & Pharmacy.
      (i.e. CC Reimbursable Ins, CCN No Fault Auto, DOD Spinal Cord Injury,
      Tricare Dental)
  
  
  2. Creates new entries in the IB ACTION TYPE file (350.1)
  
    - Adds options for clerks to choose CC, CCN or Choice for Inpatient,
      Outpatient, RX, Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) and Long-Term
      Care (LTC) charge types for 1st party charges (i.e. CC OPT, CCN
      INPT, Choice Respite Care, CC RX Copayment).
  
  3. Adds the INACTIVE field to the IB ACTION TYPE file (350.1)
  
  4. Inactivates all variations of the FEE Action Type entries in the IB
     ACTION TYPE file (350.1)
  
  5. Creates 118 new entries in the Rate Schedule file (363) for the new
     Rate Types listed in item 1.
  
  6. Allows the following Follow Up reports to produce reports using these 
     new Rate Types and Action Types.
  
     a. First Party Follow-up Report
     b. CHAMPVA/TRICARE Follow-up Report
     c. Miscellaneous Bills Follow-up Report
     d. Third Party Follow-up Report
     e. Third Party Follow-up Summary Report
  
  7. Ensures that only active Action Types (#350.1) will appear when
     selecting charges in Cancel/Edit/Add Patient Charges Menu Option
     [IB CANCEL/EDIT/ADD CHARGES].
  
  8. Ensures that the Held Charges Reports (IB OUTPUT HELD CHARGES LM and
     IB OUTPUT HELD CHARGES) will work correctly with the new Rate Types.
  
  9. Ensures that the Catastrophically Disabled Copay Report (IB CD CHARGE
     REPORT) will work correctly with the new Rate Types.
  
 10. Ensures that the Billing Activity List (IB MT BILLING REPORT) will
     work correctly with the new Rate Types.
