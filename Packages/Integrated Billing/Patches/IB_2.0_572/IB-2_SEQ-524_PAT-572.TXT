Subject: RC 124 FOR FIVE MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS RELATED GROUPS CORRECTION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Previously released patch IB*2.0*561 applied default revenue code 124 
 (PSYCHIATRIC) to five Mental Health Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) 881, 
 882, 883, 885 and 886.  These charge items included R&B (Room & Board)
 101, Intensive Care Unit 200, and Ancillary Services 240 in the CHARGE
 ITEM file (#363.2).
  
 This patch will still apply default code 124 to R&B but remove it for

 Room & Board 101 Charge Items with an effective date of October 1st, 2015
 or January 1st, 2016: 881, 882, 883, 885 and 886 if they don't exist in
 the CHARGE ITEM file (#363.2).
