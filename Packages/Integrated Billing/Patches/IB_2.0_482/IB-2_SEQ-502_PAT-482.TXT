Subject: REPORT DISCREPANCY NOT RESOLVED

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Third Party Joint Inquiry [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY] option, and 
 the ECME Billing Events Report [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS] option do not
 match if the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT (#16) field in the DRUG (#50) file is
 changed while an RX for that Drug is between Fill time and Release time.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC0000000607082 IB*2*455-Report Discrepancy not resolved
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Site user reported that IB*2.0*455 didn't resolve the discrepancy issue
  based on the original design. The design uses the drug cost on the proper
  fill/refill number in the PRESCRIPTION (#52) file to calculate the bill
  amount when the prescription is released from e-Pharmacy to IB/AR for the
  ECME claim creation. 
  
  The bill amount on the ECME Billing Events Report [IB ECME BILLING 
  EVENTS] is actually calculated from the same drug cost of the
  PRESCRIPTION (#52) file in the e-Pharmacy transaction before the release
  of the prescription. The e-Pharmacy transaction date and the prescription
  release date can be several days apart. If there is an adjustment for the
  drug cost within that time frame, the issue will be present.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  There is a new function added to routine IBCRCC. The drug cost passed from
  the e-Pharmacy transaction and stored in the COST (#.304) field of the IB
  NCPDP EVENT LOG (#366.14) file is used to calculate the bill amount for
  the ECME claim creation in IB/AR.
