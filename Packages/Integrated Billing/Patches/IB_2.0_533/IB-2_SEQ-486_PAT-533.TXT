 This patch fixes the following issues:
  
 1. When dependent inquiries are being created, the name in PID (Patient 
    Identification) segments is not populating using the patient's
    registration file name as it should.
  
 2. Appointment generated inquiries are getting stuck (i.e. nightly batch 
    extracts and inquiries are being left in a queued status).

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1. INC000001044229    Integrated Billing - e-IIV:
   
    Problem: 
    --------
    The IB system should transmit the NAME field (#.01) from the PATIENT
    file (#2) in the PID segment and the NAME OF INSURED field (#7.01) from
    the INSURANCE TYPE sub-file (#2.312) in the GT1 segment of the 270 HL7
    message when the patient is not the subscriber.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the current logic so the correct data is transmitted when the 
    patient is not the subscriber.
  
 Routines: IBCNEHLQ
  
 2. INC000001041109    Integrated Billing - Insurance Buffer:
   
    Problem: 
    --------
    When processing a non-buffer record in the IIV TRANSMISSION QUEUE file 
    (#365.1) if the INSUR RECORD IEN (#.13) field is null, an undefined
    error will occur while trying to create the PID segment for that
    record.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The code will be modified to take into account the possibility the 
    INSUR RECORD IEN (#.13) might be null for non-buffer records.
  
    In addition to preventing the undefined error, the process was modified
    so the HL7 Transmission limit, as defined by the HL7 MAXIMUM NUMBER field
    (#51.15) in the IB SITE PARAMETERS file (#350.9), is not exceeded.  
    Also, a pre-install routine will run to cancel any transmissions in the
    queue for "Appointment" extracts in a "Ready To Transmit" state with a
    SERVICE DATE (#.12) in the past.  It will also cancel any transactions
    with a QUERY FLAG (#.11) of "Identification" that are in a "Ready to
    Transmit", "Hold", or "Retry" status.
