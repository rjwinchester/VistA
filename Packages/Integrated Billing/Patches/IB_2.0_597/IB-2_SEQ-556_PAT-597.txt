Subject: FIX LOCK ISSUE; THIRD PARTY FOLLOW-UP SUMMARY; UNDEFINED LOCAL ARRAY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch addresses 3 issues:
  
  1. Update the Integrated Billing (IB) option Correct Rejected/Denied Bill
     [IB CORRECT REJECTED/DENIED] to address a missing lock issue.
  
  2. Correct the summary totals of the THIRD PARTY FOLLOW-UP SUMMARY in the
     View/Print Extracted Reports [IBJD DM VIEW/PRINT EXTRACTS] option.
  
  3. The FINDLN+64 and FINDLN+118 undefined errors occur when the IBZDATA(1)
     variable is undefined which is supposed to hold formatting data for the
     bill line.

  =======================
  1. I10582950FY16 - A bug was discovered in the Vista IB package in the 
                     option Correct Rejected/Denied Bill [IB CORRECT 
                     REJECTED/DENIED].
  
     Problem: 
     ========
     A bug was discovered in the Vista IB package in Correct
     Rejected/Denied Bill [IB CORRECT REJECTED/DENIED] menu option.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     Routine IBCC needs to be updated to include locking logic once the 
     user has selected the desired record. This logic will include a 
     warning message, "Sorry, another user currently editing this 
     entry. Try again later.", for the user if the record they request is
     currently locked by another user.
  
  2. I14387259FY17 Error in Diagnostic Measures Extract Report
  
     Problem:
     ========
     A site user reports incorrect summary totals in the THIRD PARTY
     FOLLOW-UP SUMMARY of DIAGNOSTIC MEASURES SUMMARY EXTRACTIONS reports in
     View/Print Extracted Reports [IBJD DM VIEW/PRINT EXTRACTS] option.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     The post-init routine IB20P597 was created to correct the value of the
     input variable used to calculate all inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy,
     and non-VA types of third party active receivables, instead of non-VA
     care receivables only.
  
     Routine IBJDF2 was also modified to change the array subscripts for all
     types of summary totals in the THIRD PARTY FOLLOW-UP SUMMARY via the 
     Diagnostic Measures extraction process on a monthly basis.
  
  3. I15190845FY17 - FINDLN+64^IBCEOB - TRANSMISSION EXCEPTION ERROR
  
     Problem:
     ========
     When the FINDLN^IBCEOB1 line is executed it uses the Internal 
     Entry Number (IEN) of the EOB record in file EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS
     (#361.1) to create/fill the IBZDATA array for formatting items for a
     bill. When the software creates/fills IBZDATA it looks at file IB DATA
     ELEMENT DEFINITION (#364.5) for data. So, if the IEN from file
     EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS (#361.1) is not in file IB DATA ELEMENT
     DEFINITION (#364.5) then IBZDATA is undefined.
  
     Resolution:
     ===========
     To fix this issue there is now a check before the IBZDATA array is 
     used for formatting, but after it is retrieved or created. The IBCEOB1
     routine is modified to have a I $G(IBZDATA(1))="" Q clause which looks
     at the base of the array to see if it exists.
