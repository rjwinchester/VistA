Description:
============

 *** Note:  This patch has a mandatory 3 day installation compliance.
  
 MCCF (Medical Care Collection Fund) warranty fix for the FY15 eBilling 
 Compliance Phase 3 project.
      
 This patch contains a fix for the installed patch IB*2.0*547.  When 
 testing with FSC, customer reported that they are not able to enter a 
 professional alternate payer ID on Bill Screen 10 when the charge type is 
 institutional and the form type is a CMS-1500.  The version of routine 
 IBCSC10 released in IB*2.0*547 does not handle this scenario correctly.
 This warranty patch corrects this defect in routine IBCSC10.
      
 In addition, requirements defects were also discovered.  There were 
 several changes made in patch 547 to remove the printing and transmission 
 of admission dates on all outpatient claims.  During the warranty period 
 it was discovered that Outpatient Home Health and Outpatient Hospice 
 claims still require the admission date and time or they will be rejected.  
  
 A function ($$HHLTH) was added to routine IBCEF1 to determine if a claim is 
 Home Health or Hospice.  This function was inserted into entries #77, #98 
 and #1305 of the IB FORM FIELD CONTENT file (# 364.7) to output the date for
 all inpatient claims AND all Outpatient home health and hospice claims.
  
 The purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements for the MCCF 
 eBilling Compliance Phase 3 project related to Integrated Billing (IB).
 Integrated Billing is a software module within Veterans Health Information
 Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) that provides the ability for
 billing personnel to submit claims in either a paper or electronic format
 to third-party payers.
