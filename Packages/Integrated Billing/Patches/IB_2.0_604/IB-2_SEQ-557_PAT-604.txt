Description:
============

  This patch will address 4 issues:
  
  1. The medication profile screen should show the co-payment indicator 
     for non-service connected patients.
  
  2. This patch adds a check for the FILL NUMBER (#.1) field in the
     IB BILL/CLAIMS PRESCRIPTION REFILL (#362.4) file when searching
     for third party bills with matching first party prescription 
     copayments using the Claims Matching Report [RCDP CLAIMS MATCH] 
     option. This ensures that an original prescription with a fill date 
     that differs from the date the bill was created will be included in 
     the report.
  
  3. This patch changes the process of searching for clerks when using the
     Workload Assignment Enter/Edit [IBJD FOLLOW-UP WORKLOAD] option so 
     that new entries cannot be made to the NEW PERSON (#200) file. The 
     option has been changed to search the NAME (#.01) field of the NEW 
     PERSON (#200) file, instead of searching the IB DM WORKLOAD PARAMETERS
     (#351.73) file. The entry found in the NEW PERSON (#200) file is then 
     used to search the IB DM WORKLOAD PARAMETERS (#351.73) file, and will
     allow a new entry to be made if a match is not found.
  
  4. For certain Clinical Procedure Terminology (CPT) codes we need 
     to enter a procedure description- for CPT J1566 we do not have 
     this option in V2. Other VistA sites allow you to enter the 
     appropriate information. Can an update be done to V2 to have this
     option for this CPT code- it is causing claims to deny.

  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ================
   
  1. I11160987FY17 - AEU reports the medication profile screen does not show
                     the co-payment indicator for non-service connected patients.
   
     Problem:
     --------
     The co-payment indicator "$" is not displaying on medication profiles so 
     Accounts Receivable is not picking up potential billable amounts until 
     after the medication is released.
  
    
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The routine IBARX can be modified to check a patient's medication co-payment
     exemption status to determine if the co-payment indicator should appear.
  
  2. I12679229FY17 - vhacpalantzd--VistA - Non-VRAM User--Claims Matching
     Report Omissions
   
     Problem:
     --------
     Veterans who are charged a First Party Co-Pay for medication are
     not receiving proper credit for corresponding Third Party Payments as
     required. This is occurring because the VistA Claims Matching Report 
     [RCDP CLAIMS MATCH] is not including claims for original prescriptions
     that have a FILL DATE (#22) field in the PRESCRIPTION (#52) file that is 
     different than the DATE (#.03) field in the IB BILL/CLAIMS PRESCRIPTION 
     REFILL (#362.4) file.
  
    
     Resolution:
     -----------
     In the routine IBEFURF, added a check in the Claims Matching Report [RCDP 
     CLAIMS MATCH] for the FILL NUMBER (#.1) field in IB BILL/CLAIMS 
     PRESCRIPTION REFILL (#362.4) file to allow searching of prescriptions by 
     fill number in addition to fill date.
  
  3. I16239935FY17 - AR Productivity Report (Routine ^IBJDF8I) Adding Entries
                     to File 200
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The Workload Assignment Enter/Edit [IBJD FOLLOW-UP WORKLOAD] option will
     allow the user to create new entries in the NEW PERSON (#200) file if they
     enter a unique name in the lookup of the CLERK NAME (#.01) field of the IB
     DM WORKLOAD PARAMETERS (#351.73) file. This is because the CLERK NAME (#.01)
     field of the IB DM WORKLOAD PARAMETERS (#351.73) file is a pointer to the
     NEW PERSON (#200) file, and the FileMan ^DIC call allows learning new 
     entries. Learning new entries allows the search to display entries from the
     NEW PERSON (#200) file, but also allows new entries to be made to the file.
  
    
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Changed the FileMan ^DIC call in the routine IBJDF8I to search the NAME
     (#.01) field of the NEW PERSON (#200) file instead of searching the CLERK
     NAME (#.01) field of the IB DM WORKLOAD PARAMETERS (#351.73) file. This   
     search will not allow new entries to be made to the NEW PERSON (#200) file.
     A second search is then performed on the CLERK NAME (#.01) field of the IB 
     DM WORKLOAD PARAMETERS (#351.73) file using the entry found in the NEW  
     PERSON (#200) file. This second search will allow new entries to be made to 
     the IB DM WORKLOAD PARAMETERS (#351.73) file. The Workload Assignment
     Enter/Edit [IBJD FOLLOW-UP WORKLOAD] option requires the user to have
     the security key IBJD WORKLOAD ASSIGNMENT.
  
  4. R7964411FY16 - CPT code issue
      
     Problem:
     -------
     Description field is not always accurately displayed, due to the fact IBCU7
     does not always select the correct CPT code/does not have the ability to 
     trim duplicate white spaces off strings when evaluating if a code is a 
     'NOC'.
  
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The ^IBCU7 routine was updated so that the description prompt should only
     be displayed if a CPT code can be categorized as a Not Otherwise 
     Categorized ('NOC'). This can be determined by evaluating the DESCRIPTION
     (#.01) subfield of the DESCRIPTION (#62) Multiple to see if they contain 
     any of the following: NOT OTHERWISE, NOT ELSEWHERE, NOT LISTED, UNLISTED, 
     UNSPECIFIED, UNCLASSIFIED, NON-SPECIFIED, NOS, NOS;, NS., NOS,, NOS/, 
     (NOS), NOC, NOC;, NOC., NOC/, (NOC). If so, the description prompt should
     be displayed. The original issue was coming from bad data being in the 
     DESCRIPTION (#.01) subfield of the DESCRIPTION (#62) multiple (extra white
     spaces) making it so ^IBCU7 could not determine the status of the code. 
     This has the potential to effects all CPT codes, not just J1566 as reported. 
     However, this was remedied by a data clean up so the original issue could
     not be duplicated. However, to prevent this from happening again, an 
     extrinsic function 'TM' was added to trim off white spaces before 
     evaluating them with the 'NOC' subroutine within ^IBCU7. It was also 
     discovered during testing that ^IBCU7 was not selecting the correct version
     of a CPT code depending on the date. This issue was remedied by removing 
     the direct reads to ^ICPT, replacing them with the appropriate Application
     Programming Interface calls which help select the correct version of a
     CPT code depending on the date selected. This update now makes the 
     software Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant.
