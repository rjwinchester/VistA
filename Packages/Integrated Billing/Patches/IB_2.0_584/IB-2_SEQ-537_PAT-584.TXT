 2. R12055122FY17 13 Station Additions v3.21
    
    Problem:
    --------
    The CBO has requested the billing region update for the following 13

    671GC
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch updates 13 billing regions to match the facility type 2 in 
    the primary division of host files.
   
    Routines: IBYP584, IBYP584A
  
  
 Technical Description
 =====================
 The patch exports 3 routines, two of which are the post-init (IBYP584 and
 IBYP584A).
  
 The post-init will inactivate all existing Reasonable Charges defined in the
 Charge Master.  Reasonable Charges v3.19 will be inactivated with an 
 inactive date of 12/31/16 when this patch is installed.
  
 The post-init will also update 13 billing regions with the facility type 2
 to match the primary division of host files.
  
 The following is an example of the post-init portion of the installation:
  
     Reasonable Charges v3.21 Post-Install .....
  
       >> Inactivating Existing Reasonable Charges, Please Wait...
          Done.  277574 existing charges inactivated
  
       >> Updating Billing Regions with Provider Based (Facility Type 2)
          RC 568HA - NEWCASTLE, WY
          Done.  1 facility type of billing regions changed
  
     Reasonable Charges v3.21 Post-Install Complete
  
 Note:  The actual number of charges inactivated and facility type of billing
 regions changed will vary based on the number of divisions billed at your
 site.  This will also determine the time required for the installation.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the
 following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file be disabled to prevent 
 possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will 
 not be affected.
  
      Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO]
      Enter/Edit Charge Master [IBCR DISPLAY CHARGE MASTER]
                        
 Install Time - less than 30 minutes - but will vary from site to site
 depending on the size of the Charge Item file (#363.2) which is searched
 for charges to inactivate in the Post-Init.
   
 Loading the Charge Master with the new RC v3.21 charges is separate from 
 the patch installation and will take additional time per division.

 After patch installation, the Reasonable Charges v3.21 charges will need 
 to be loaded into the Charge Master for each division billed at the site.

 disk space.  Other files will be searched, but the new charges will be 
 added to the Charge Item file (#363.2).

 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext. 
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may also 
 elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server listed below. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the documentation using Secure File Transfer Protocol 
 (SFTP) in ASCII format from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the

 Upload Instructions:
 ====================
   
 Step 1:  Get Host Files
 -----------------------
 Retrieve the 6 Reasonable Charges v3.21 Host Files in ASCII format (see
 previous section).
                                         
 Step 2:  Determine Divisions
 ----------------------------
 Use the Print Charge Master [IBCR REPORTS FOR CHARGE MASTER] option and
 print the Billing Regions report to find which Billing Regions and 
 Divisions have charges loaded onto your system.  These are the divisions 
 that will need new charges loaded.
                                         
 Step 3:  Begin Upload Process
 -----------------------------
 Use the Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option 
 to load Reasonable Charges onto your system for every division for which
 care is billed at your site. Carefully follow the instructions below, for 
 each Billing Region. 
                                         
 You will see the prompt:
       Select one of the following:
  
             1.1       Load CMAC into XTMP
             1.2       Load AWP into XTMP
             1.3       Load RC into XTMP
             1.4       Load TP into XTMP
             2         Assign Charge Set
             3         Check Data Validity
             4         Load into Charge Master
             5         Delete XTMP files
                                        
 Below, in more detail, the steps will guide you through the process of 
 selecting first 1.3, then 3, then 4, and wait until 4 stops before
 continuing on to the next division (and capturing or printing all output 
 for future reference).
  
 Step 4:  Load the Reasonable Charges
 ------------------------------------
 From the menu, select option 1.3 - Load RC into XTMP
                                        
 This loads the Host Files into temporary storage and calculates charges
 for individual Divisions.
                                        
   - If there are no previously existing host files loaded, it will ask 
     which version of Reasonable Charges to load.    
     Select 3.21
  
   - When loading Reasonable Charges v3.21 the IBRC1701x.TXT files may be 
     used for multiple divisions without reloading.  
                                        
   - If there exists any previously calculated charges (files) for a 
     division, they will be displayed, and you will get the prompt:
  
         The above files already exist in XTMP.
         Delete the above files and continue with upload?
     Select Yes, to delete the previously calculated charges.
                                          
   - If there exist any previously loaded host files for any RC version, 
     they will be displayed, and it will ask if they should be deleted.
     Select No, if the files are IBRC1701x.TXT since these are the  
     correct files for v3.21, they may be re-used for multiple divisions.
     Select Yes only if the files are from a different version.
                                        
   - Select Division:  Select the division number to load charges for. 
     This should correspond to the Divisions associated with the Billing 
     Regions determined previously.  Once the correct division is 
     selected, answer Yes to Calculate Charges.
  
 Step 5: Check Data Validity
 ---------------------------
 From the menu, select option 3 - Check Data Validity.
 This is optional, but it is suggested that it be run at least once, for
 the first division loaded.
  
 If the resulting report has any Line Data Errors, then check that the
 latest version of CPT and DRG has been installed. The Error key at the end
 of the report does not mean that errors have occurred.  It simply provides
 definitions of the types of errors that might occur.  Check the individual
 line items in the report to see if any of the listed errors have been
 detected.
  
 Step 6: Load into Charge Master
 -------------------------------
 From the menu, select option 4 - Load into Charge Master
 Moves the charges calculated in selection 1.3 to permanent storage in the 
 Charge Master.  The results report should match the examples below.
  
 It is important that this option completes before continuing.  Allow the 
 upload of a division's charges to finish before attempting to upload 
 another division.  A summary report will be printed when the upload is 
 complete.  This option uses the same temporary files to calculate the
 charges for all divisions, therefore they must be calculated and loaded 
 serially.
  
 Step 7: Repeat steps 4-6 for each Division needed
 -------------------------------------------------
 Steps 4-6 must be repeated for each division billed at your site.  Refer 
 to the Divisions that already have charges assigned using the Billing 
 Region Report list determined previously.
  
 In most cases, simply using the above options for loading Reasonable
 Charges will result in the correct set up in the Charge Master. 
  
 -  Option 1.3, to calculate charges for a division
 -  Option 4, to load those calculated charges into the Charge Master 
    permanent files.
  
 However, if you are loading charges for a new site, or a site that may
 have changed its division number, then extra care is needed to ensure 
 the setup of the Charge Master is correct. The following sections provide 
 examples of displays and reports for the upload.
