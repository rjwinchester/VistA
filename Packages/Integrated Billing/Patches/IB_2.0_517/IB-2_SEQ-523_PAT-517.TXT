 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The post installation routine, IBY517PO, sets up defaults for the new IB 
 SITE PARAMETERS (#350.9) fields, and the routine is automatically deleted 
 after the install.  The post install also schedules the HCSR NIGHTLY 
 PROCESS [IBT HCSR NIGHTLY PROCESS].
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. Installation may be queued.  
  
 This patch should take less than 5 minutes to install.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch, IB*2.0*517.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch #(ex.
     IB*2.0*517):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Enter the Coordinator for the Mail Group 'IBTR 278
     MESSAGE':', respond with the name of the person who will be the
     coordinator for this new mail group.  This would be the Information
     Resource Management (IRM) representative or person responsible
     for HL7 issues.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Enter the Coordinator for the Mail Group 'IBTUPD
     MESSAGE':', respond with the name of the person who will be the
     coordinator for this new mail group. This would be the IRM or person
     responsible for HL7 issues.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? YES//', respond YES.
  
 8.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//', respond NO.
  
 9.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
 10.  If prompted "Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0// respond 0.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 Once the installation has been completed, it might be necessary to 
 change the scheduled time of the new HCSR NIGHTLY PROCESS [IBT HCSR
 NIGHTLY PROCESS], which sends inquiries on pending entries and purges old
 entries, to run at a more convenient time.  It is initially set to run
 daily at 9PM.
  
 If installing into a production account, enable the logical links for the
 HL7 interfaces.
  
 1.  From the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU], select Filer and Link
     Management Options [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT].
 2.  Select Start/Stop Links [HL START].
 3.  When prompted to "Select HL LOGICAL LINK NODE:" enter "HCSR OUT"
     and press ENTER. 
 4.  The system will display "This LLP has been enabled!" to confirm 
     that the HCSR OUT link has successfully started.
 5.  Repeat with HL LOGICAL LINK "IBTUPD OUT" 
  
 There is one new Security Key, IB HCSR PARAM EDIT. Assignment 
 of this Security Key will be coordinated with eBilling, CPAC and VAMCs. 
 IRMs will not have to assign the security key upon installation.
  
 The person that is assigned this new Security Key will need to run menu
 option IBJ MCCR SITE PARAMETERS [MCCR Site Parameter Display/Edit] and 
 select the 'HS' action to add the Insurance Companies, Clinics, and Wards
 that are to be 'included' in the search.
  
 NOTE: If Insurance Companies to be included are not set, then the
 nightly process will not find any appointments or admission to add to
 the HCSR Worklist. At this point, no insurance companies should be set.  
 eBilling will work with VAMCs to set TRICARE/CHAMPVA at some point in the 
 future.
