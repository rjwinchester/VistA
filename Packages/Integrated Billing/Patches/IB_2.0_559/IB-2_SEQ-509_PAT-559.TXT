 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 I6735135FY16 Reasonable Charges v3.18
   
   Problem:
   --------           
   Changes in the national CPT rates need to be distributed to all
   hospitals so that proper billing can take place.
    
   Resolution:
   -----------
   This patch updates the Reasonable Charges files and distributes
   them with a new version number and a new effective date.
   
   
 Technical Description
 =====================
 This patch exports 2 routines, one of which is the post-init (IBYP559)
  
 The post-init will inactivate all existing Reasonable Charges defined in the
 Charge Master.  Reasonable Charges v3.17 will be inactivated with an 
 inactivation date of 12/31/15 when this patch is installed.
    
 The following is an example of the post-init portion of the installation:
   
     Reasonable Charges v3.18 Post-Install .....
   
       >> Inactivating Existing Reasonable Charges, Please Wait...
          Done.  93007 existing charges inactivated
   
     Reasonable Charges v3.18 Post-Install Complete
   
 Note:  The actual number of charges inactivated will vary based on the 
 number of divisions billed at your site.  This will also determine the 
 time required for the installation.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the 
 following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file be disabled to prevent 
 possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will 
 not be affected.
   
   
      Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO]
      Enter/Edit Charge Master [IBCR DISPLAY CHARGE MASTER]
                          
 Install Time - less than 30 minutes - but will vary from site to site
 depending on the size of the Charge Item file (#363.2) which is searched
 for charges to inactivate in the Post-Init.
   
 Loading the Charge Master with the new RC v3.18 charges is separate from 
 the patch installation and will take additional time per division.

     ------------------------------
     Follow instructions below: RC v3.18 Upload Instructions
    
  
 ********************** RC v3.18 Upload Instructions **********************
  
 After patch installation, the Reasonable Charges v3.18 charges will need 
 to be loaded into the Charge Master for each division billed at the site.
                                    
 The charges for each Division will require approximately 1.8 - 2.0 MB of 
 disk space.  Other files will be searched, but the new charges will be 
 added to the Charge Item file (#363.2).
    
 The following patches should be installed before Uploading Reasonable 
 Charges v3.18 once they are released, otherwise the Charges need to be 
 uploaded twice (once now, and once after these patches for the new or 
 re-active codes).

 Files Required for Upload:
 --------------------------
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the documentation directly using Secure File Transfer 
 Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following OI

 Upload Steps:
 =============
   
 Step 1:  Get Host Files
 -----------------------
 Retrieve the 6 Reasonable Charges v3.18 Host Files in ASCII format (see
 previous section).
                                         
 Step 2:  Determine Divisions
 ----------------------------
 Use the Print Charge Master [IBCR REPORTS FOR CHARGE MASTER] option and 
 print the Billing Regions report to find which Billing Regions and 
 Divisions have charges loaded onto your system.  These are the divisions 
 that will need new charges loaded.
                                         
 Step 3:  Begin Upload Process
 -----------------------------
 Use the Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option 
 to load Reasonable Charges onto your system for every division for which
 care is billed at your site. Carefully follow the instructions below, for 
 each Billing Region. 
                                         
 You will see the prompt:
                  
       Select one of the following:
 ============================================================================
  
             1.1       Load CMAC into XTMP
             1.2       Load AWP into XTMP
             1.3       Load RC into XTMP
             1.4       Load TP into XTMP
             2         Assign Charge Set
             3         Check Data Validity
             4         Load into Charge Master
             5         Delete XTMP files
                                         
 Below, in more detail, the steps will guide you through the process of 
 selecting first 1.3, then 3, then 4, and waiting until 4 stops before 
 continuing on to the next division (and capturing or printing all output 
 for future reference).
   
 Step 4:  Load the Reasonable Charges
 ------------------------------------
 From the menu, select option 1.3 - Load RC into XTMP
                                         
 This loads the Host Files into temporary storage and calculates charges
 for individual Divisions.
   
   - If there are no previously existing host files loaded, it will ask 
     which version of Reasonable Charges to load.    
     Select 3.18
                                         
   - When loading Reasonable Charges v3.18 the IBRC1601x.TXT files may be 
     used for multiple divisions without reloading.  
                                         
   - If there exists any previously calculated charges (files) for a 
     division, they will be displayed, and you will get the prompt:
   
         The above files already exist in XTMP.
         Delete the above files and continue with upload?
     Select Yes, to delete the previously calculated charges.
                                       
   - If there exist any previously loaded host files for any RC version, 
     they will be displayed, and it will ask if they should be deleted.  
     Select No, if the files are IBRC1601x.TXT since these are the  
     correct files for v3.18, they may be re-used for multiple divisions.
     Select Yes only if the files are from a different version.
                                         
   - Select Division:  Select the division number to load charges for. 
     This should correspond to the Divisions associated with the Billing 
     Regions determined previously.  Once the correct division is 
     selected, answer Yes to Calculate Charges.
   
 Step 5: Check Data Validity
 ---------------------------
 From the menu, select option 3 - Check Data Validity.
 This is optional, but it is suggested that it be run at least once, for 
 the first division loaded.
    
 The following DRGs are now inactive and will show as line errors on this
 report, this may be ignored: DRG268, DRG269, DRG270, DRG271, DRG272,
 DRG273 and DRG274. 
  
 PLEASE NOTE: Those DRGs will be re-active with the install of ICD*18.0*82
 and they won't show as line errors on the report once the charges are
 uploaded twice.
  
 If the resulting report has any Line Data Errors, then check that the
 latest version of CPT and DRG has been installed.  The Error key at the
 end of the report does not mean that errors have occurred.  It simply
 provides definitions of the types of errors that might occur.  Check the
 individual line items in the report to see if any of the listed errors
 have been detected.
  
 Step 6: Load into Charge Master
 -------------------------------
 From the menu, select option 4 - Load into Charge Master
 Moves the charges calculated in selection 1.3 to permanent storage in the 
 Charge Master.  The results report should match the examples below.
   
 It is important that this option completes before continuing.  Allow the 
 upload of a division's charges to finish before attempting to upload 
 another division.  A summary report will be printed when the upload is 
 complete.  This option uses the same temporary files to calculate the
 charges for all divisions, therefore they must be calculated and loaded 
 serially.  
                                         
 Step 7: Repeat steps 4-6 for each Division needed
 -------------------------------------------------
 Steps 4-6 must be repeated for each division billed at your site.  Refer 
 to the Divisions that already have charges assigned using the Billing 
 Region Report list determined previously.
    
 In most cases, simply using the above options for loading Reasonable
 Charges will result in the correct set up in the Charge Master. 
    
 -  Option 1.3, to calculate charges for a division
 -  Option 4, to load those calculated charges into the Charge Master 
    permanent files.
                                          
 However, if you are loading charges for a new site, or a site that may 
 have changed its division number, then extra care is needed to ensure 
 the setup of the Charge Master is correct. The following sections provide 
 examples of displays and reports for the upload.
    
 ================= Reasonable Charges v3.18 Upload Details ================
  
 The Charge Host Files should load with the following counts:
