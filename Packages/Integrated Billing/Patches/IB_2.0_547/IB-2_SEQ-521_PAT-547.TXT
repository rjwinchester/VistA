Description:
============

 Important Note: In production, there is one **MANDATORY** pre-installation
 activity associated with this install.
  
 The IB Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission queue PRIOR to the
 installation of this patch.
  
 Please reference instructions from the Pre/Post Installation Overview for 
 further details.
  
 The purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements for the MCCF 
 eBilling Compliance Phase 3 project related to Integrated Billing (IB).
 Integrated Billing is a software module within Veterans Health Information
 Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) that provides the ability for
 billing personnel to submit claims in either a paper or electronic format
 to third-party payers. The IB module also transmits and receives HL7
 messages from FSC. This effort will include adding a new inbound HL7
 message for the ASC X12N Health Care Claim Request For Additional
 Information (RFAI) (277) transactions to the existing interfaces with FSC.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
     
 1. Remedy ticket - #1262831
    
 Problem:
 -------
 Problem with Re-Generate Unbilled Amounts Report [IBT RE-GEN UNBILLED 
 REPORT]. After install of IB*2*516 the last 3 columns of the report for
 CPT, I. Rate, and P. Rate no longer display data.
      
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Corrected with the install of this patch.  We modified the Re-generate 
 Unbilled Amounts report summary to display the summary totals before
 divisional totals and to provide the ability to select whether or not the
 report is sorted by division.
      
 2.  CA SDM Ticket - #I6528186FY16
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If the user selects to sort the CBW (COB Management Worklist) by
 Secondary Insurance Company, when the worklist displays the Secondary
 Insurance Company name in the header is incorrect.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Corrected with the install of this patch.  The IBCAPP2 routine was
 incorrectly assuming for secondary claims where Medicare was the insurer,
 that the tertiary insurance company was the current insurance company
 name to use in the header.
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 Pittsburgh
 South Texas
 Northern Indiana

 Patch Installation:
    
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 ****Important Note: In production, there is one **MANDATORY**
 pre-installation activity associated with this install.
     
 The IB Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission queue
 PRIOR to the installation of this patch. ***
     
 The site Information Resource Management (IRM) would coordinate with the
 Billing Department to insure that the 837 extract/transmission queue is
 empty. The Billing Department should be aware of the set of instructions
 to be executed. If not billing supervisor can be contacted. Once the
 Billing Department has completed the instruction, the Billing department
 is to inform IRM that the patch installation could proceed.
    
 The instructions to empty the queue are as follows:
    
 Select the option:   TRANSMIT EDI BILLS - MANUAL [IBCE 837 MANUAL 
 TRANSMIT]
     
   What is the purpose of this option?
    This option is used to by-pass the normal daily/nightly transmission
    queues if the need arises to get the claim to the payer quickly.
     
   When is this option used?
    There are occasions when there is a need to transmit a claim(s)
    immediately instead of waiting for the batching frequency as scheduled
    in the MCCR Site Parameter.  This option will allow sending individual
    claim(s) or all claims in a ready for extract status.
      
   Upon selecting this option you will be prompted with the following:
     Select one of the following:
      A  Transmit (A)LL bills in READY FOR EXTRACT status
      S  Transmit only (S)ELECTED bills
     
   You should select 'A' for ALL
     
 Once the Billing Department has completed the instruction, the Billing
 department is to inform IRM that the patch installation could proceed.
     
 There are no other mandatory pre-installation activities associated
 with this package.
    
 The Pre-install routine (IBY547PR) will automatically do the following:
 *     Update all active rate types to be transmittable electronically.
 *     Update the ouptut formatter entries.
    
 The Post-install (IBY547PO) will automatically do the following:
 *     Set new CROSS-REFERENCES for existing fields 3.02 (EDI ID NUMBER
           - PROF) & 3.04 (EDI ID NUMBER - INST) in file 36 (INSURANCE 
           COMPANY). 
 *     Set new multi=field (#15 PRINTED CLAIMS RC EXCLUSIONS) in file 
           #350.9 (IB SITE PARAMETERS) for the default Revenue Code 
           Exclusions on the Printed Claims Report.  (270-279 & 290-299)
 *     Set initial values in new multiple (#81 PRIMARY PAYER ID TYPES 
           MED) in file #350.9 to the default Administrative Contractors 
           for Medicare.  (DME)
 *     Set initial values in fields 52.01 & 52.02 in file #350.9.  RFAI 
           Transaction Purge Days (#52.01) set to null for 'no purge' and 
           RFAI Worklist Purge Days (#52.02) set to 20 days.
     
 Routines IBY547PO and IBY547PR can be manually deleted by IT/IRM upon
 completion of the installation.
