Description:
============

  ****************************************************************
                NOTICE!!!!!  5 DAY COMPLIANCE PERIOD
  ****************************************************************
  
  The Office of Community Care (OCC) is requesting system enhancements to
  the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
  (VistA) Integrated Billing (IB), Accounts Receivable (AR), and Fee 
  Basis (FB) software modules that would allow segregating all billing
  and collection activities for Non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
  Care Third Party Insurance carriers' reimbursement.
  
  The primary goal of this enhancement is the continued preparation of the
  IB software module for the implementation of further changes required by
  the Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside
  Networks (MISSION) Act.
  
  The second goal of this enhancement is to increase timeliness and
  collections of billable Non-Veterans Affairs (VA) care services.
  Enhancements to existing VistA IB, AR, and Fee software applications
  would allow for increased efficiency in workflow processes leading to
  best practices that would ultimately be reflected in improved customer
  service to our Veteran population.
  
  In order to meet these goals, this patch:
  
  1. Updates the 1st Party Follow-up Report [IBJD FOLLOW-UP FIRST PARTY]
     to allow the forthcoming CC URGENT CARE Copayments to display on the
     report.
  
  2. Update the Held Charges Reports [IB OUTPUT HELD CHARGES and IB OUTPUT 
     HELD CHARGES LM] to allow the new CC URGENT CARE Copayments to 
     display on the report.
  
  3. Modify the IB CANCEL/EDIT/ADD co-pay screen to allow the display of 
     the automatically created Outpatient RX Copays when the user allows
     RX copays to display.
  
  4. Modify the IB MT PROFILE report to allow Outpatient RX copays to
     display on the report.
  
  5. Modify the IB CANCEL/EDIT/ADD co-pay software to prevent users from 
     adding multiple co-pays of the same time for Inpatient and Outpatient
     copays on the same day (this fix excludes potential per diem copay
     duplication at this time).
  
  6. Modify the Release Charges On Hold Report (IB MT RELEASE CHARGES) to
     display the correct bill type for Urgent Care co-payments.
