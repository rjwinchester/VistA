  >>>Occurrence Span Code
     #72 FIRST/LAST DAY updated
     #74 LEAVE OF ABSENCE DATES updated

 created from the installation instruction.
  
 Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option.  The message containing the 
 backed up routines can be loaded with the, "Xtract PackMan", function at 
 the Message Action prompt.  The PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE is 
 then used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA system.
  
 The Occurrence Span & Value Codes can be updated by using FileMan utility
 in the MCCR UTILITY (#399.1) file. Or you may contact the National Help
 desk to log a ticket for assistance.
