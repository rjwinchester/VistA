Category: 
  - Routine

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000001107435    Integrated Billing - Application Error:
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 While the IB MT NIGHT COMP job is running it has the potential to process
 records that lead to the generation of the same alert infinitely until 
 the process is terminated manually.  This occurs when a record needs
 to be updated and the update fails and the alert process is triggered.
 During the alert process the variable IBDA is overwritten which is 
 subsequently used by the main process to identify "the last record 
 processed" so it starts all over.  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Prior to setting IBDA variable for the alert process, it is "Newed" so that
 upon exiting the alert process the variable returns to its prior value
 allowing the processing of the records to continue without restarting.
