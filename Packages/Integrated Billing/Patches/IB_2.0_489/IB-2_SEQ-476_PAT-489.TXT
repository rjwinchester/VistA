Subject: DUPLICATE CLAIMS TRACKING ENTRIES, TPJI DISPLAY FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes two issues. The Veterans w/Insurance and Opt. Visits [IB 
 OUTPATIENT VET REPORT] option has been updated to prevent the possibility
 of having duplicate Claims Tracking (#356) file entries. The Third Party
 Joint Inquiry [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY] option has been updated to
 keep display data under the appropriate header in the LINE LEVEL
 ADJUSTMENTS section when the SERVICE DATE FROM (#.16) sub-field is
 blank.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000599165 Duplicate encounters
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When the 'Reports can Add CT' parameter is set to 'YES' in the Claims
  Tracking Parameter Edit [IBT EDIT TRACKING PARAMETERS] option, it allows
  a queued task to add the outpatient encounters to Claims Tracking (#356) 
  file entries in the Veterans w/Insurance and Opt. Visits [IB OUTPATIENT
  VET REPORT] option. Duplicate Claims Tracking (#356) file entries were
  created when that option was scheduled to run at the same time as the
  Manually Add Opt. Encounters to Claims Tracking [IBT SUP MANUALLY QUE
  ENCTRS] option or the Queue Means Test Compilation of Charges [IB MT
  NIGHT COMP] option (other options that add those entries).
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routine IBTRKR4 was updated to lock/unlock the Claims Tracking procedure
  for the outpatient care which will now allow only one task at one time  
  to add the outpatient encounter to the Claims Tracking (#356) file.
  
  When the [[IBT SUP MANUALLY QUE ENCTRS] option is queued in multiple tasks
  by different users to run at the same time, or it's running with the [IB
  OUTPATIENT VET REPORT] option at the same time, a mail message - "The
  process to automatically add Opt Encounters is currently locked by
  another user. Try again later." will send to the requesting user if any
  task fails to lock in the process for the CT update.
  
 2. INC000000765203 EOB Display Issue in TPJI for Cigna
  
  Problem:
  --------
  It has been reported that the line level adjustments didn't list the 
  items under the appropriate heading in the Bill Charges (BC) action of
  the Third Party Joint Inquiry [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY] option.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routine IBCECSA5 was updated to correct the display if the data doesn't
  exist in the 835 LINE LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS (#15 multiple) SERVICE DATE
  FROM (#.16) sub-field of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) (#361.1) file.
