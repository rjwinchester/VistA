Description:
============

 This patch implements changes to VistA's Integrated Billing (IB) module as
 requested by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Chief Business 
 Office (CBO) eBusiness Solutions Department to comply with the 
 legislative changes mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and
 Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).
  
 ***Note:
 The host file "MCCF_FY14_HPID_EIV_1_0.KID" contains two patches 
 (Eligibility IB*2.0*528 and HPID IB*2.0*525) that are bundled together 
 into this host file.   The two patches are NOT DEPENDENT on each other.   
 After loading the distribution "MCCF_FY14_HPID_EIV_1_0.KID" and  
 installing the distribution "MCCF FY14 HPID EIV 1.0",  the installation 
 of BOTH patches (Eligibility IB*2.0*528 and HPID IB*2.0*525) will be 
 installed together AUTOMATICALLY.
  
 ***Note:
 When installing patch IB*2.0*525 answer "YES" at the following prompt:
 Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO//YES
 In general, the sites may have a background process that is jobbed off at 
 non-peak hours to Rebuild the Menu Trees. It is recommended that the 
 sites rebuild the Menu Trees (after the patch is installed and during 
 non-peak hours).
  
 ***Note:
 There is a data report such that when printing/displaying/exporting 
 the data it is recommended to use the 132 or 254 columns to 
 display/print/export. The users will receive a warning message in such a 
 case.
                                
 PMAS Increment 9 of IB*2.0*525 (HPID Build 3) contains the changes made to
 the BILL/CLAIMS File (#399) to track changes to the claim-level HPID
 Fields #471, #472, and #473.
  
 PMAS Increment 10 of IB*2.0*525 (HPID Build 3) implements a menu option
 that runs an ad-hoc report listing Authorized claims that have had
 claim-level HPIDs added within a selected date range.
