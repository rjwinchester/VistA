 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000983291 Menu Additions
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Chief Business Office (CBO) has requested a patch to add 3 actions for
 the Fee Service INPT Per Diem type and 3 actions for the Fee Service NSC
 RX Copay type to the IB Action Type file (#350.1). The billing rates for
 those new action types will be added to the IB Action Charge file (#350.2)
 as well.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Post init routine IB20P524 uses the DG INPT PER DIEM type and the PSO NSC
 RX COPAY type as the base to create these 6 new actions in the IB ACTION 
 TYPE file (#350.1) and the associated billing rates with the effective
 date of 03/12/2014 in the IB ACTION CHARGE file (#350.2) detailed below.
  
  IB action types in file (#350.1)
  --------------------------------
  FEE SERV INPT PER DIEM NEW
  FEE SERV INPT PER DIEM CANCEL
  FEE SERV INPT PER DIEM UPDATE
  FEE SERV NSC RX COPAY NEW
  FEE SERV NSC RX COPAY CANCEL
  FEE SERV NSC RX UPDATE
  
  IB billing rates in file (#350.2)
  ---------------------------------
  the new FEE SERV INPT PER DIEM NEW rate of $10
  the new FEE SERV NSC RX COPAY NEW rate of $8, additional amount of $1
  the new FEE SERV NSC RX COPAY CANCEL rate of $8, additional amount of $1
  the new FEE SERV NSC RX COPAY UPDATE rate of $8, additional amount of $1
  
 Routine IBEBR was also modified to add those new billing rate types:
 FEE SERV INPT PER DIEM and FEE SERV NSC RX CO-PAY (RX1) to the selective
 list in the ENTER/EDIT BILLING RATES [IB BILLING RATES FILE] option.
  
  
 2. INC000000766238 Functionality Issue: spool device
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the BILLING LAG TIME REPORT [IBJD BILLING LAG TIME] option is run to
 the screen or to the spooler, the last entry on the page contains only the
 first two fields of the data (patient name and SSN). The top of the next
 page repeats the patient's name and SSN followed by the remaining fields:
 Bill #, Date of Care, Check Out, and Days.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The software in routine IBJDB12 was modified to correct the display of the
 associated claim activity data for the patient when it reaches end of 
 page.
