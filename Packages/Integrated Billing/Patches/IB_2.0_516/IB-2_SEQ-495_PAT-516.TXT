============

 *************************************************************************
 Important Note: There is one **MANDATORY** pre-installation activity
 associated with this install.
  
 The IB Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission queue PRIOR to the
 installation of this patch.
  
 Please reference instructions from the Pre/Post Installation Overview for 
 further details.
  
 Additionally, the patch installation instructions include a menu rebuild
 to remove a deleted option.  It is **STRONGLY SUGGESTED** that the rebuild
 of primary menu trees occurs during non-peak hours.  The patch should 
 either be installed during non-peak hours, or you may enter NO to the 
 Rebuild Menus prompt if your system does this in a nightly TaskMan 
 process.
  
 Important Note: After Initial Operating Capabilities (IOC) was completed, 
 the ICD10 development team discovered a Severity Level 3 defect: 
  
 The attending provider's name is not being automatically added to Billing
 screen 10, Section 3 when a bill is created by the AutoBiller and the
 provider has a valid National Provider Identifier (NPI). Note that the 
 attending provider's name transmits when the biller manually adds it to 
 the bill.
  
 This has been logged as Remedy ticket INC000001243424 and will be 
 addressed in a future release.

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions
 ------------------------------------ 
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as 
 follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Hines          ftp.domain.ext   <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 ****Important Note: There is one **MANDATORY** pre-installation
     activity associated with this install.
  
 The IB Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission queue PRIOR to
 the installation of this patch. ***
  
 The site Information Resource Management (IRM) would coordinate with the
 Billing Department to insure that the 837 extract/transmission queue is
 empty. The Billing Department should be aware of the set of instructions
 to be executed. If not billing supervisor can be contacted. Once the
 Billing Department has completed the instruction, the Billing department
 is to inform IRM that the patch installation could proceed.
  
 The instructions to empty the queue are as follows:
  
 Select the option:   TRANSMIT EDI BILLS - MANUAL [IBCE 837 MANUAL 
 TRANSMIT]
  
   What is the purpose of this option?
    This option is used to by-pass the normal daily/nightly transmission
    queues if the need arises to get the claim to the payer quickly.
  
   When is this option used?
    There are occasions when there is a need to transmit a claim(s)
    immediately instead of waiting for the batching frequency as scheduled
    in the MCCR Site Parameter.  This option will allow sending individual
    claim(s) or all claims in a ready for extract status.
  
   Upon selecting this option you will be prompted with the following:
     Select one of the following:
      A  Transmit (A)LL bills in READY FOR EXTRACT status
      S  Transmit only (S)ELECTED bills
  
   You should select 'A' for ALL
  
 Once the Billing Department has completed the instruction, the Billing
 department is to inform IRM that the patch installation could proceed.
  
 There are no other mandatory pre-installation activities associated
 with this package.
  
 ****Important Note: After IOC was completed, the ICD10 development team
     discovered a Severity Level 3 defect: 
  
 The attending provider's name is not being automatically added to Billing
 screen 10, Section 3 when a bill is created by the AutoBiller and the
 provider has a valid NPI. Note that the attending provider's name
 transmits when the biller manually adds it to the bill.
   
 This has been logged as Remedy ticket INC000001243424 and will be 
 addressed in a future release.
  
 The pre-installation routine will delete unused Output Formatter entries.
  
 The pre and post installation routines will recompile the Input Templates
 for the Billing Screens.
