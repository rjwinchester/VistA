============

 ***************************** ATTENTION **********************************
 The Collaborative Terminology Tooling & Data Management (CTT DM) Native
 Domain Standardization (NDS) Payers Domain enhancement includes 3 patches
 that must be installed in the following order:
  
      1.  XU*8.0*683 (This patch is a required pre install for HDI*1.0*20)
      2.  HDI*1.0*20
      3.  IB*2.0*585
 **************************************************************************
  
 The VA has established a process for implementing standard 
 terminology/terminologies within individual clinical domains for the 
 exchange of data. The intent of this effort is to provide the detailed 
 groundwork necessary for industry-wide interoperability. The objective 
 of this process is to enable the most user friendly interface as 
 possible in the implementation of the native standardization along with
 all of the activities required to operationalize the change within the 
 VistA environment and the associated terminology consuming applications.
  
 This patch implements Payers domain changes required by the
 Collaborative Terminology Tooling & Data Management (CTT & DM) Native
 Domain Standardization (NDS) project. This patch adds a new MASTER TYPE 
 OF PLAN (#355.99) file, and a new MASTER TYPE OF PLAN (#15) field in the 
 TYPE OF PLAN (#355.1) file pointing to the new MASTER TYPE OF PLAN 
 (#355.99) file.
  
 The new MASTER TYPE OF PLAN (#355.99) file contains the Public Health 
 Data Standards Consortium (PHDSC) Source of Payment code set. The new
 MASTER TYPE OF PLAN (#15) field in the TYPE OF PLAN (#355.1) file points 
 to the MASTER TYPE OF PLAN (#355.99) file, and provides a method of 
 associating TYPE OF PLAN (#355.1) file entries to the national PHDSC 
 standard code set.
  
  
 Master Type of Plan Association [IBMTOP ASSN]
 ---------------------------------------------
  TYPE OF PLAN file (#355.1) entries may be associated with the MASTER 
  TYPE OF PLAN file (#355.99) via the Master Type of Plan Association
  [IBMTOP ASSN] option, at the following menu path:
  
   - Billing Supervisor Menu [IB BILLING SUPERVISOR MENU]
    -  MCCR System Definition Menu [MCCR SYSTEM DEFINITION MENU]
      - Master Type of Plan Menu [IBMTOP MNU]
       -  Master Type of Plan Association [IBMTOP ASSN]
  
  This option prompts the user to select an entry from the TYPE OF PLAN 
  file (#355.1), displays information about the Type of Plan including 
  whether it is associated with a MASTER TYPE OF PLAN file (#355.99) entry,
  and then prompts the user to select a MASTER TYPE OF PLAN to associate 
  with the TYPE OF PLAN.
  
  Example, Master Type of Plan Association:
  
   Select Master Type of Plan Menu Option: ASSN  Master Type of Plan
    Association
  
     This option allows VA TYPE OF PLAN file entries to be associated with
     MASTER TYPE OF PLAN file entries to enhance interoperability. MASTER
     TYPE OF PLAN file entries represent the Source of Payment Typology
     developed by the Public Health Data Standards Consortium (PHDSC).

 Master Type of Plan Report [IBMTOP RPT]
 ---------------------------------------
 New option Master Type of Plan Report [IBMTOP RPT] has been created to
 report the association of entries from the TYPE OF PLAN (#355.1) file to
 the MASTER TYPE OF PLAN (#355.99) file. The report is available at the 
 following menu path:
   - Billing Supervisor Menu [IB BILLING SUPERVISOR MENU]
    -  MCCR System Definition Menu [MCCR SYSTEM DEFINITION MENU]
      -  Master Type of Plan Menu [IBMTOP MNU]
        -  Master Type of Plan Report [IBMTOP RPT]
  
 The report may be run as a summary or a detailed report, both of which may
 be run for (A)ll TYPE OF PLAN (#355.1) entries, only entries that are
 (M)apped to the MASTER TYPE OF PLAN (#355.99) file, or only entries that
 are (U)nmapped. Both summary and detailed reports may also be printed in
 delimited output format, which can be captured via terminal log and loaded
 into a spreadsheet or other tabular document.
  
 The summary report prints the Type of Plan name, the mapping status 
 (i.e., whether or not the Type of Plan is associated with a Master Type 
 of Plan), and the Master Type of Plan name if an association exists.
  
 Example output, Master Type of Plan Report Summary:
  
    Type of Plan: MANAGED CARE SYSTEM (MCS)
    Mapped to Master Type of Plan (MTOP): NO
  
    Type of Plan: MEDICAID
    Mapped to Master Type of Plan (MTOP): YES
       MTOP Name: Medicare Test
  
 The detailed report prints the information from the summary report, as 
 well as details about both the Type of Plan and the Master Type of Plan 
 if an association exists.
  
 Example output, Master Type of Plan Report, Detailed:
  
    Type of Plan: MEDICAID
    Abbreviation: MD              Status: ACTIVE
        Category: MEDICAIDE
    Mapped to Master Type of Plan (MTOP): YES
       MTOP Name: Medicare Test
     MTOP Status: ACTIVE
     MTOP Parent: HMO
    MTOP Replaced By: Medicare HMO
  
    Type of Plan: MEDI-CAL
    Abbreviation: MCAL            Status: ACTIVE
