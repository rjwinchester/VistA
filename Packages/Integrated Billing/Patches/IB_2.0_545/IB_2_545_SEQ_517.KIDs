"BLD",9242,1,23,0)
 The Outpatient Pharmacy and supporting VistA applications are being modified
"BLD",9242,1,24,0)
 to allow dispensing of more than 90 day supply fill for outpatient 
"BLD",9242,1,25,0)
 prescriptions. The new limit will be 365 days and will be set for each drug
"BLD",9242,1,26,0)

 Although patches PSJ*5*289 and PSS*1*174 introduced quite a few enhancements
"BLD",9242,1,33,0)
 to the IV Additives and IV Solutions ordering functionality they did not go
"BLD",9242,1,34,0)

"BLD",9242,1,35,0)

"BLD",9242,1,36,0)

1. Cancel/Edit/Add Patient Charges [IB CANCEL/EDIT/ADD CHARGES] option
"BLD",9242,1,44,0)
   This menu option was modified to allow up to 12 copay units to be added
"BLD",9242,1,45,0)
   for a patient. Before the maximum limit was 3, given that 90 days supply
"BLD",9242,1,46,0)
   corresponded to 3 copay units (1 unit for each 30 days supply)
"BLD",9242,1,47,0)
  
"BLD",9242,1,48,0)
2. The upper limit for the value allowed for the DAYS SUPPLY field (#.06) in

   the IB BILL/CLAIMS PRESCRIPTION REFILL file (#362.4) was changed from 90
