Description:
============

  *******************************************************************************
  Please install this patch at your earliest convenience. When you install this
  patch into your production account, an extract of insurance company data will
  be transmitted to the eBusiness Solutions group of the Chief Business Office
  (CBO). Once received, this extract will be combined with extracts from other
  VAMC sites -- a time-consuming process. In order to allow the eBusiness team
  adequate time to consolidate this data, it would be appreciated if this patch
  could be installed closer to the beginning of the compliance window rather than
  toward the end of it.  Please note that the post-install extract does NOT run
  when installed into a test/mirror account.
  
  After installing this patch in your production account, you must enable the
  logical link for the HL7 interface to the NIF. Instructions for doing this
  are included in the post-install instructions below.  Please do NOT enable the
  link in your test/mirror account.
  *******************************************************************************
  
  The Health Plan Identifier (HPID) project implements a new national
  standard of having a single identifier to use on electronic transmissions
  pertaining to health care. All entities that are financially responsible
  for care are assigned a HPID or Other Entity Identifier (OEID), used for
  entities that aren't traditional health plans. This new standard 
  increases interoperability by replacing clearinghouse-specific
  identifiers for health plans.
  
  This patch updates the Integrated Billing (IB) package to enable it to
  store these new HPIDs and OEIDs, and to associate the entries in the 
  local INSURANCE COMPANY file (#36) with a new National Insurance File
  (NIF). The NIF is housed at the Financial Services Center (FSC), which will
  centrally manage distribution of HPID/OEID data.
  
  This patch introduces a new Health Level Seven (HL7) interface for
  exchanging insurance information with the NIF. Included with this 
  new interface is a logging function which generates transaction records,
  facilitating troubleshooting. These records are periodically purged by the
  software itself.
  
  When installed into a production account, this patch will transmit a flat-file
  extract to the FSC in order to assist in the setup of the NIF.
  
  Additional patch items:
  
  1) If a user selects the option PROCESS INSURANCE BUFFER
     [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS] and they have neither of the
     security keys (IB INSURANCE COMPANY EDIT and IB GROUP PLAN EDIT),
     then the only insurance buffer records that are displayed to them
     would be entries for Electronic Insurance Verification (eIV) confirmed
     active policies ("+" entries) when the patient in that record has an active
     policy on file in VistA.  This patch increases the number of potential
     active policies that users may process.
  
  2) Corrected a problem that occurs on some insurance buffer entries. With
     the menu option PROCESS INSURANCE BUFFER [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER
     PROCESS], a user can select to Expand Entry (action 'EE').  Some
     records, when expanded, are showing that the eIV response is based
     on an unknown Service Date and unknown Service Type.  This is being
     corrected to report the correct service date and type.  This data
     is only available to those buffer entries that were processed by
     eIV.
  
  3) Corrected a problem that occurs with the option PROCESS INSURANCE
     BUFFER [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS].  If a user selects the
     Expand Entry action ('EE') followed by the Response Report action
     ('RR'), when the user exits the eIV Response Report the display
     does not show the detail of the record and page 0 of 0 is displayed.
     The software has been updated so that the display is correct
     when a user exits the eIV Response Report.
  
  4) Corrected a problem where the Total Charges dollar amount (BOX24F) and
     the Days/Unit (BOX24G) were printing one character too far over to the
     right on the CMS-1500 form and causing BOX24G's data to run into BOX24H.
     To support this, the IB FORM SKELETON DEFINITION (#364.3) entry for
     BOX24F (record 1487) had its Length field (#.09) changed from 9 to 8.
  
  5) Corrected a problem where the Total Charges dollar amount was dropping
     the last number in the cents field on the TPJI->BC (Bill Charges) display
     screen.

   Patch Installation: 
  
   Pre/Post Installation Overview
   ------------------------------
   This patch should be installed during a period of low system activity 
   with IB users off the system. After this patch is installed in your
   production account, a task will be scheduled to send an extract of the
   INSURANCE COMPANY file (#36) to the FSC to aid in setting up the NIF.
   By default, the task will begin immediately after the installation is
   complete, but this can be delayed until a later time if necessary. Since
   this patch should be installed during a period of low system activity,
   the chance of this extract impacting users' sessions is low. This should be
   taken into account when deciding on the timing of this extract. The extract
   will not be scheduled when installed into your test account.
  
   Don't forget to enable the logical link (in your production account only) 
   for the HL7 interface (step 3 of the post install instructions) immediately
   after installing the patch.
  
   Installation Instructions
   -------------------------
   This patch should be installed during a period of low system activity 
   with IB users off the system. No options need to be placed out of
   service. Installation time is expected to be less than 5 minutes.
  
   Pre-Installation Instructions
  
   1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
    
   2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
   3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
       select the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use 
       the following option. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the 
       patch # (IB*2.0*519):
  
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
           backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
           (routines, data dictionaries, templates, etc.). Note: Because
           of a typo in the previous patch, you may see the message
           " *** WARNING, you are missing one or more Patches ***" when comparing
           IBCNEHL4. You may safely ignore this warning, and the typo that
           caused KIDS to display this message has been fixed.
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
  
   4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
       choose the patch to install. Enter IB*2.0*519.
  
   5.  When prompted for 'Enter the Coordinator for Mail Group 'NIFQRY':",
       respond with the name of the Mail Group Coordinator for the 
       Integrated Billing package or a facility Mail Group Coordinator.
  
   6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
       Install? NO//', respond NO.
  
   7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', respond NO.
  
   8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
   9.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0. 
  
   Post-Installation Instructions
   ------------------------------
   1.  You will be prompted 'Requested Start Time: NOW//
  
       At this prompt, you may enter a time to run the data extract after
       installation, with a default of immediately. If you wish to delay
       the extract until a later time, enter that time at this prompt.
       This prompt will be skipped if the install is queued. In that case,
       the extract will be executed at the time the install is performed.
       This prompt will only appear when installing into a production account.
  
   2.  If you are installing into a production account and you chose to delay
       the extract, you will see 'Task #' followed by the number of your
       scheduled task. You will need this number if you want to confirm that 
       your task has been scheduled to run. To confirm this, from the Taskman
       Management menu, select List Tasks, then Your future tasks. Check the
       output from that option for an entry matching your task number, and
       verify that it is scheduled for the appropriate time.
  
   3.  If installing into a production account, enable the logical link for
       the HL7 interface to the NIF.
       a.  From the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU], select Filer and Link
           Management Options [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT].
       b.  Select Start/Stop Links [HL START].
       c.  When prompted to "Select HL LOGICAL LINK NODE:" enter "IB NIF TCP"
           and press ENTER.
       d.  The system will display "This LLP has been enabled!" to confirm that
           the IB NIF TCP link has successfully started.
