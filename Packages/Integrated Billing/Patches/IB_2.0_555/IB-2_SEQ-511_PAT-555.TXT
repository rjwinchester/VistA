 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000001306422 Integrated Billing - Other: Incorrect unit rate
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site user receives the old dental rates since they are no longer separate
 rates and included in the outpatient visit rates for FY 2015.
  
 The Chief Business Office (CBO) has instructed to add two new Ineligible
 Dental for Cost-Based and Inter-Agency rates with an effective date of
 11/04/2014.  These will distinguish between the outpatient dental rates
 and the outpatient visit rates.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A post-init routine IB20P555 was created to add two new Ineligible Dental
 rates for Cost-Based and Inter-Agency billing charge items with an
 effective date of 11/04/14 to the CHARGE ITEM file (#363.2). It will also
 update the charge sets with the Ineligible Dental in the RATE SCHEDULE
 file (#363) if they don't exist.
  
 2. INC000000875035 Integrated Billing - Reports Issue:
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site user reports that she is unable to print the [IB OUTPUT DAYS ON HOLD]
 Days On Hold Report. The report doesn't generate an error and just sits in
 processing mode but never completes it.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine IBOHDT was modified to correct an infinitive looping problem caused
 by the value of the 'DFN' variable for the patient when it was reset for a
 different patient within the scope of the 'FOR' command for the report.
