 PROBLEM: 
 --------
 Every year, the government sets new values for the Medicare deductible and
 for the pension threshold rates. These values need to be updated in the
 associated billing files for accurate and legal billing. The purpose of
 this patch is to assist sites in the entry of the Basic Pension Threshold
 rates and the Medicare Deductible value for Calendar Year 2016.
  
 RESOLUTION:
 -----------
 A post-init routine is included in this patch, which will automate the 
 update of the new Medicare and pension threshold values. The Technical 
 section below contains a list of the new rates, which may also be found in
 VHA FACT SHEET titled MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST AND
 MAXIMUM ANNUAL RATES OF PENSION FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2016. If a site has
 already entered the values manually, the record will be overwritten with
 the national update.
  
 The new pension rates for Calendar Year 2016 (with an effective date of
 12/1/15) are defined in VHA FACT SHEET titled MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-
 BASED MEANS TEST AND MAXIMUM ANNUAL RATES OF PENSION FOR CALENDAR YEAR 
 2015 as:
   
  *   $ 12,868 for a single veteran without dependents
  *   $ 16,851 for a veteran with 1 dependent
  *   An additional $ 2,198 for each additional dependent beyond 1 
      dependent
   
 Medicare deductible rate effective 01/01/2016 is shown as:
   
  *   The Medicare deductible:  $ 1,288.
   
 TECHNICAL:
 ---------- 
  
 File #350.2 -- IB ACTION CHARGE is updated with a new record.  The values 
 are as follows:
   .01  KEY                 = "MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE"
   .02  EFFECTIVE DATE      = 3160101 (internal form for January 01, 2016)
   .03  IB TRANSACTION TYPE = pointer to "MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE" in file #350.1
   .04  UNIT CHARGE, FIXED  =  1288
   ==========
    
 File #354.3 -- BILLING THRESHOLDS is updated with a new record.  The 
 values are as follows:
   .01  DATE                        = 3151201 (internal form for 12/01/2015)
   .02  TYPE                        = 1       (for BASIC PENSION)
   .03  BASE RATE FOR VETERAN       = 12868
   .04  BASE RATE WITH 1 DEPENDENT  = 16851
   .05  BASE RATE WITH 2 DEPENDENTS = 19049
   .06  BASE RATE WITH 3 DEPENDENTS = 21247

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 --------------------------
 The components sent with this IB*2.0*557 patch have been included in the 
 HOST File DG_53_P922.KID.  Please follow the instructions listed in the 
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS section of the patch description for patch 
 DG*5.3*922.
    
 NOTE: Please bear in mind items below for install.
   
  1.  During installation, the BILLING EXEMPTIONS file (#354.1) will be
      checked for medication co-payment exemptions based on prior
      thresholds. If they exist, the installer will be prompted to
      UPDATE AND PRINT the exemptions report since the exemption status may
      change due to the new rates.
    
      Press <Enter> to accept the default value of Update & Print. At the
      DEVICE prompt you must enter a valid print device. An entry is 
      required and the HOME device is not allowed; neither are the
      P-Message device or Spooler device (this will abort the install). You
      MUST choose a valid printer. You need not queue the report since the
      patch will do so automatically.
