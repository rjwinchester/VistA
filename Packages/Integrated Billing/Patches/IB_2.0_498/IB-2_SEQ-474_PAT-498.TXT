Subject: CHAMPVA & CHAMPVA REIM. INS. CHARGE SETS UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains two issues:
  
 1. The first issue involves three non-billable HCPCS (Healthcare Common
    Procedure Coding System) codes for prosthetic items that need to be
    filtered out of the Claims Tracking module. 
  
 2. The second issue concerns the CHAMPVA & CHAMPVA REIMBURSEMENT INSURANCE
    rate schedules linking to RC (Reasonable Charges) charge sets are not
    automatically updated in the Rate Schedule file(#363).

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000852299 Integrated Billing - Claims Tracking
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The Chief Business Office (CBO) has requested a patch to filter prosthetics
  out of the Claims Tracking module when their HCPCS codes have 2 alpha
  characters beginning with BA, HI and TM.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routine IBTRKR5 was modified to exclude prosthetics items in claims
  tracking if the associated HCPCS codes start with 2 alpha characters
  of BA, HI and TM.
  
 ROUTINE: IBTRKR5
  
 2. INC000000394830 Tricare/CHAMPVA are not automatically updated
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When new divisions are added or existing ones convert to provider base
  rates in the RC host file load process, CHAMPVA & CHAMPVA REIMBURSEMENT
  INSURANCE rate schedules linking with RC charge sets are not automatically
  updated in the Rate Schedule file.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routine IBCRHU2 was modified to automatically update CHAMPVA & CHAMPVA
  REIMBURSEMENT INSURANCE rate schedules linking to RC charge sets in the
  Rate Schedule file. A post-init routine IB20P498 was also created to update
  CHAMPVA & CHAMPVA REIMBURSEMENT INSURANCE rate schedules with charge sets
  to keep them up to date.
  
 ROUTINE: IBCRHU2 and IB20P498
