Subject: USER CANNOT CLEAR NEEDS SC DETERMINATION RNB

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses one (1) issue:
  
 1. Electronic Claims Management Engine (ECME) won't submit a claim with
    a Service-Connected (SC) issue, even after the user indicates that the
    issue has been resolved.  Same issue is reset again and again, with 
    Reason Not Billed (RNB), message of "Needs SC Determination".  This
    occurs with any of the possible SC conditions.

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1.  I9937559FY16 - User Cannot Clear Needs SC Determination RNB
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Whenever a Pharmacy Prescription needs to be billed to a 3rd Party 
 payer, VistA refuses to submit it to ECME, and returns the reason as 
 "Needs SC Determination". The user cannot successfully tell VistA that 
 the SC issue has been resolved and get it to submit the claim.  No
 matter how many times they try, it keeps responding with a RNB of
 "Needs SC Determination", and fails to submit the claim to ECME. Analysis 
 of the code involved reveals that the flag (IBQ) intended to 
 indicate that the SC Determination had been resolved was also used in an 
 earlier check for ROI (Release of Information). If the ROI value was 
 zero(0), it would quit before getting to the SC check code. So if it 
 continued past the ROI Check, IBQ would always have a non-zero value,
 since the code never reset it to zero(0). The result was that if the SC 
 Check was performed, it would always quit due to the value set in the 
 ROI code, even if the user told VistA that the SC issue was resolved.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Routine IBNCPBB has been modified to reset the IBQ flag to zero (0)
 after the ROI Check, so the SC Check results will reflect the actual
 findings for SC.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch 
    can be installed when Pharmacy and Integrated Billing users are on 
    the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
          problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
       Following options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       To preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch prior
       to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' 
       option at this time. You may also compare the routines in your 
       production account to the routines in the patch by using the 
      'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' 
       Menu and select the package 'IB*2.0*575'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       YES//, choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
       And Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
