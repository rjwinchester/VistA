 1. R12631500FY17 Stop Code Changes for FY17 - Emergency
   
    Problem: 
    -------
    The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) of 2016 directs the
    Department of Veterans Affairs to expand its opioid safety initiative 
    to include all VA medical facilities.  CARA exempts Veterans from 
    paying a copayment to the VA for education on opioid safety to include 
    overdose prevention and treatment for overdose.  In order to schedule, 
    track and exempt from copayments these opioid education visits, 
    designated clinics must be established.  An emergency Stop Code patch 
    is required to implement these clinics by April 1, 2017.
   
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Add requested Stop Codes as described below:
