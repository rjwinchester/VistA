Pre/Post Installation Overview
"BLD",8717,1,202,0)
------------------------------
"BLD",8717,1,203,0)
There are three post installation routines associated with this patch 
"BLD",8717,1,204,0)
DG867PO, FB146PO, and IB499PO. These routines primarily serve as filters 
"BLD",8717,1,205,0)
for the data transmitted to the appropriate files listed above, so that 
"BLD",8717,1,206,0)
only the intended data is delivered. The only exception is the IB499PO 
"BLD",8717,1,207,0)
routine which programmatically makes an addition to the help text of the 
"BLD",8717,1,208,0)
FAMILY PREFIX field (#.03) in the SPONSOR RELATIONSHIP file (#355.81). 
"BLD",8717,1,209,0)
These post installation routines may be deleted after successful 
"BLD",8717,1,210,0)
installation of the NEWBORN DG FB IB BUNDLE 1.0.

------------------------------
"PKG",200,22,1,"PAH",1,1,203,0)
There are three post installation routines associated with this patch 
"PKG",200,22,1,"PAH",1,1,204,0)
DG867PO, FB146PO, and IB499PO. These routines primarily serve as filters 
"PKG",200,22,1,"PAH",1,1,205,0)
for the data transmitted to the appropriate files listed above, so that 
"PKG",200,22,1,"PAH",1,1,206,0)
only the intended data is delivered. The only exception is the IB499PO 
"PKG",200,22,1,"PAH",1,1,207,0)
routine which programmatically makes an addition to the help text of the 
"PKG",200,22,1,"PAH",1,1,208,0)
FAMILY PREFIX field (#.03) in the SPONSOR RELATIONSHIP file (#355.81). 
"PKG",200,22,1,"PAH",1,1,209,0)
These post installation routines may be deleted after successful 
"PKG",200,22,1,"PAH",1,1,210,0)
installation of the NEWBORN DG FB IB BUNDLE 1.0.
