  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch implements changes to VistA's Integrated Billing (IB), 
 Insurance Company, and Patient Insurance File modules are requested by 
 the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Chief Business Office (CBO)
 eBusiness Solutions Department to comply with the legislative
 changes mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
 Act of 1996 (HIPAA).
  
 The IB application is a character-based system using VA FileMan as its 
 database manager and Cache/M (TRM approved, 
 http://trm.oit.domain.ext/StandardPage.asp?tid=6402) as the programming 
 language. This software application is part of the VistA suite of 
 applications, which includes additional clinical and financial 
 applications. There are no Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).
  
 ***Note:
 The newly added software application "System Sharing Verified Insurance
 (SSVI)" Parameter in the eIV Site Parameters is set to the OFF position 
 during the install. DO NOT TURN ON. This patch will install all necessary
 source code, data dictionaries, options, templates etc. for the SSVI
 application, however, this feature should be left in the OFF position so
 as to Not initiate the SSVI feature. This feature will be modified in the
 future IB projects with instructions on how to use this newly added 
 feature.
  
 ***Note:
 IB SSVI mail group:
 During the install a new mail group "IB SSVI" will be installed within 
 the VistA database and the installer will be prompted to "Enter the 
 Coordinator for Mail Group IB SSVI:".  The IB SSVI mail group will need 
 the name of a person that will be responsible (COORDINATOR) for 
 maintaining the membership of the IB SSVI mail group.  Mail messages will 
 be sent to the IB SSVI mail group for identifying SSVI issues.
 The coordinator name is the appropriate CPAC insurance verification 
 manager for the specific region.  If you do not know the name of the CPAC 
 insurance verification manager please contact the rapid response mail 
 group at: vhaeinsurancerapidresponse@domain.ext
  
 ***Note:
 The newly added software application "Consistency Checker" source code 
 that uses the options Patient Insurance Info View/Edit (PI)-->
 Verify Coverage (VC) is now disabled ('commented out') so as to Not Use 
 the "Consistency Checker" source code to verify coverage.  This feature 
 will be modified within future IB projects with instructions on how to 
 use this newly added "Consistency Checker" feature in conjunction with
 the SSVI feature. DO NOT ENABLE THE SSVI UTILITY.
  
 ***Note:
 The host file "MCCF_FY14_HPID_EIV_1_0.KID" contains two patches 
 (Eligibility IB*2.0*528 and HPID IB*2.0*525) that are bundled together 
 into this host file.   The two patches are NOT DEPENDENT on each other.   
 After loading the distribution "MCCF_FY14_HPID_EIV_1_0.KID" and  
 installing the distribution "MCCF FY14 HPID EIV 1.0",  the installation 
 of BOTH patches (Eligibility IB*2.0*528 and HPID IB*2.0*525) will be 
 installed together AUTOMATICALLY.
  
 ***Note:
 When installing patch IB*2.0*528 answer "YES" at the following prompt:
 Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES// YES
 In general, the sites may have a background process that is jobbed off at 
 non-peak hours to Rebuild the Menu Trees. It is recommended that the 
 sites rebuild the Menu Trees (after the patch is installed and during 
 non-peak hours).
  
 ***Note:
 There are several data reports that when printing/displaying/exporting 
 the data it is recommended to use the 132 or 254 columns to 
 display/print/export. The users will receive a warning message in such a 
 case. It is recommended to have the users terminal emulation setting for 
 the 'auto-wrap' feature set to 'on'. This will allow the user to view 
 text on the next line when the user is entering/editing comment text 
 fields that extend past the end of the line.
  
  
 System Sharing Verified Insurance (SSVI):
 -----------------------------------------
 The Eligibility Benefits and Claims Status Data Content and 
 Infrastructure (Phase 2, Iteration 2) project task will utilize IB 
 Patient Insurance data stored in VA VistA databases residing on 
 approximately 134 VA VistA servers located at 129 VA Medical Centers. 
 There are approximately 750 current users of the IB Patient Insurance 
 application within the VA VistA databases.
  
 Updates to the Patient Insurance data will be shared between VA VistA 
 sites both locally and nationally where the patient has been seen.  Only 
 those sites that choose to turn on this option will receive the updated 
 Insurance information.
  
 Note:  A new user, AUTOUPDATE,IBEIV, will be created in the NEW PERSON
 File (#200) during installation.  When a patient's insurance is updated at
 a receiving site, this user name will be the generic name showing that the
 insurance was last updated or verified by the SSVI process.
  
 The actual transmission of insurance information to other subscribers 
 shall be done in a batch processing fashion. This will be executed by a 
 background job that shall be tasked once a day.
  
 The background job will search for patients who have had the flag to 
 transmit the patient's information set via user indication.
  
 When the Background job runs, it will take the latest "snapshot" of the 
 patient's insurance information (all Active policies & plans, along with 
 all Medicare (M) plans).
  
 After a user updates a patient Insurance record a trigger is initiated 
 that will at the end of the day create a global file containing the 
 updated patient Insurance. Those messages will only be sent to those 
 sites where that patient had visits.  
 A "consistency checker" to ensure all required sub-fields under the 
 Insurance Type multiple field (multiple field # .3121) in the Patient 
 (#2) file are complete before sending the information to other 
 facilities. A parameter, in the form of a VistA option, will be created 
 to allow each VA site to enable or disable this feature.  
 A user report can be run for sending and receiving patient insurance 
 information at a site.
  
  
 SSVI - Data Source/Location(s):
 -------------------------------
 The updated Insurance information will reside in the site's existing 
 VistA database where the patient has been seen and optionally transferred 
 to those subscribing VA sites via Remote Query. Those subscribing sites 
 will receive then store the updated information within their VA VistA 
 database until processed.
  
 Three files have been created. IB INSURANCE CONSISTENCY ELEMENTS (#366.2) 
 contains the fields or categories to be checked for inconsistencies 
 following an editing session of the insurance edit option information.  IB
 INSURANCE INCONSISTENT DATA (#366.1) is a storage area for all the fields
 or categories that have been recently found to be inconsistent. IB SSVI
 PIN/HL7 PIVOT (#366) is a storage area for all the remote query
 transaction information.
  
 The project will allow the processing/sending of updated patient 
 insurance information via Remote Query messaging.  The user will set a 
 flag to have the option of transmitting any updated patient insurance 
 information.
  
  
 Eligibility Benefits and Claims (Screens):
 ------------------------------------------
 The Eligibility Benefits and Claims Status Data Content and 
 Infrastructure (Phase 2, Iteration 2) project task will create 
 enhancements to the VA VistA system utilizing the IB Version 2.0 software 
 application.
  
 Enhancements will include the creation/modifications of existing 
 Insurance screens/menus/options/templates/files.  
  
 1.      A newly created Subscriber screen will display a side-by-side 
 comparison of the Insurance Verification Processor buffer information 
 against the patient's Subscriber information found in either the Patient 
 File(#2) or the Income Person File (#408.13) depending on what the user 
 selects at the "Patient Relationship to Subscriber" prompt.
  
  
 2.      A newly created Annual Benefits screen will allow the user to 
 View/Edit/Save the patient annual benefits found within file (#355.4) 
 Annual Benefits File.
  
 3.      A newly created Coverage Limitations screen will allow the user 
 to View/Edit/Save the patient coverage limitations data found within file 
 (#355.32) Plan Coverage Limitations File.
  
 4.    Standardization of certain insurance subscriber display field names 
 from "Insured (Person)" or "Patient" to "Subscriber".
  
  
 Security Key Updates:
 ---------------------
 Updates will be made to IB Insurance security keys.
  
 1.    The post-install routine for this patch will rename the IBCNE IIV 
 AUTOMATCH security key to IBCNE EIV MAINTENANCE and assign it as 
 appropriate.
  
 2.    The renamed IBCNE EIV MAINTENANCE key will be assigned to the IBCNE 
 PAYER MAINTENANCE MENU and its options IBCNE PAYER EDIT and IBCNE PAYER 
 LINK, replacing the IB INSURANCE SUPERVISOR lock on these options.
  
 3.    The renamed IBCNE EIV MAINTENANCE key will be assigned to the 
 IBCNSC INS CO PAYER protocol, i.e., the Payer Action (PA) on the IBCN 
 INSURANCE CO EDIT option.
  
  
 Eligibility Benefits and Claims (Patient Policy Comments): 
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 Enhancements made to the patient policy comments displayed in the Patient
 Policy Screens.
 Option:  Patient Insurance Info/Edit (PI)
 Software modifications made to the VP View Policy action located on the 
 Patient Policy Information screen include:
 a.  Retrieval of comment data from the new COMMENT - SUBSCRIBER 
 POLICY multiple (2.312, 1.18). 
 b.  Display of comments in Comment -- Patient Policy region.
  
 Affected Options:
 Patient Insurance Info/Edit [IBCN PATIENT INSURANCE]
 Third Party Joint Inquiry [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY]
 View Patient Insurance [IBCN VIEW PATIENT INSURANCE]
 Claims Tracking Edit [IBT EDIT BI TRACKING ENTRY]
  
 Software modifications made to the  AC Add Comment action on the Patient 
 Policy Information screen include:
   a.  Provides the capability for the user to enter up to 245 
 characters of comments
   b.  Provides the capability for the user to edit previously entered 
 comments entered on the same day
   c.  The user-entered comments, the date/time that the comment was 
 entered/edited, and the user ID (DUZ) gets stored in the respective 
 fields of the COMMENT - SUBSCRIBER POLICY multiple (2.312, 1.18): 
       COMMENT DATE/TIME (2.342,.01) 
       LAST EDITED BY (2.342,.02)
       COMMENT (2.342,.03)
   d.  Due to the authorized usage of the existing COMMENT PATIENT POLICY
     field (2.312, 1.08) by other applications (ICRs), the old comment
     field and the new comment multiple are to be populated until the
     IA subscribers have made the necessary changes to their applications
     to reference the new fields at the 2.312, 1.18 multiple.  To that end
     the following DD definitions were made:
      i. Trigger cross-reference was defined to the COMMENT field (2.342,
         .03) that will populate the COMMENT PATIENT POLICY field  (2.312,
         1.08) when data is entered/edited at the COMMENT field (2.342,
         .03).
     ii. Mumps cross-reference was defined to the COMMENT PATIENT POLICY
         field (2.312, 1.08) that will populate the fields at the COMMENT
         SUBCRIBER POLICY multiple only when both the old and the new
         comment field is different.
