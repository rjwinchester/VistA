Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements of the Medical Care
 Collection Fund (MCCF) Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Transaction 
 Application Suite (TAS) Phase 2 project.
  
  
 1.  VistA has been modified to tell the Financial Services Center (FSC),
     when sending insurance inquiry messages, how the inquiry was created 
     or if it is a retransmission or re-try.
  
 2.  VistA has been modified so that unwanted coverage limitation dates and
     related values can be quickly identified and deleted without
     compromising the group.
  
 3.  VistA has been modified to store the method of response processing for
     all insurance verification that take place in VistA.  The system will
     capture whether the inquiry was created by a human or no-touch method.
     The system will also capture how the insurance information was
     processed, whether it be by a human or a no-touch method.
   
 4.  VistA has been modified so that when the Medicare electronic 
     Explanation of Benefits (eEOB) returns, the system will persist the
     Source of Information (SOI) if it is populated with a valid value on
     the patient policy.
  
 5.  Corrected the VistA software where an invalid value was being
     populated in the Source of Information field when a new Patient Policy
     was created.
  
 6.  VistA has been modified to correct the Insurance Import misfiling. Now
     an Insurance Verifier can see all data elements of an imported patient
     insurance policy in the correct fields in the option PROCESS INSURANCE
     BUFFER so that electronic Insurance Verification (eIV) can attempt to
     verify the eligibility for benefits and thus the buffer entries can be
     processed properly.
  
 7.  VistA has been modified to change the name of the Source Of
     Information (SOI) file (#355.12) entry's DESCRIPTION field (#.02) from
     "PURCHASED CARE CHOICE" to "COMMUNITY CARE NETWORK". Also, changed the
     IB BUFFER ACRONYM field (#.03) from "PCC" to "CCN" for the same SOI
     entry.
