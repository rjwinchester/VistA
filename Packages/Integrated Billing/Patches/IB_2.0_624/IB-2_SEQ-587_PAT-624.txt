 KIDS multi-build name:  PSO IB BUNDLE 10.0
   KIDS Host File name:  PSO_7_528_IB.KID
  
  
 This patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
   1. The VA Mission Act of 2018 modified the 7332 requirements concerning
      signed ROIs and the billing of services related to sensitive
      diagnoses.  The system is being updated to no longer check for ROI
      for sensitive drugs to validate billable status during claim
      submission if the date of service of the claim is on or after 
      1/28/2019.  For claims with a date of service prior to that date, the
      system will continue to perform existing ROI checks. 
  
   2. The determination of billing eligibility is being modified in how it
      evaluates patients with both TRICARE and CHAMPVA eligibility.
