Description:
============

 The patch implements modifications for Mental Health Suicide Prevention -
 Suicide High Risk Patient Enhancements (SHRPE) project. The goal of this
 effort is to improve the delivery of targeted Mental Health care for
 individuals at high risk for suicide. Modification of outpatient visit
 and RX copayment functionality for Veterans assessed as being at high
 risk for suicide involves making changes to the existing VistA and payment
 systems to support regulatory change processes aimed at removing financial
 barriers that may prevent these Veterans from engaging in enhanced care,
 which includes more frequent contacts and dispensing medications in
 smaller amounts more frequently, as safety precautions.
  
 The patch makes the following modifications:
  
     Modifications to prevent Outpatient visit copayment charges from being
 created/charged for patients with the national HRfS flag active on the 
 date of service.
     Modifications to the menu option IB CANCEL/EDIT/ADD CHARGES to prevent
 Outpatient visit copayment charges from being added manually for patients 
 with the national HRfS flag active on the date of service.
     Modifications to prorate Rx copay amounts paid by patients with the 
 national HRfS flag active on the date of service if the supply is for 
 less than 30 days.
     The modification to the menu option IB CANCEL/EDIT/ADD CHARGES for the
 manual process of adding Rx charges to support prorated amounts for Rx 
 copays: 
     - add the prompt "Days' Supply" if the Patient has the HRfS flag,
     - if the supply is for less than 30 days, then prorate the cost.
     A new entry HRFS FLAGGED was added to IB CHARGE REMOVE REASONS file 
 (#350.3) to support visit copay exemptions for patients with the national 
 HRfS flag active on the date of service.
     The new field is #70.02  SHRPE ACTIVATION DATE was added to the file 
 #350.9 IB SITE PARAMETERS. This new field is used to activate 
 functionality delivered by the patch. This field is not set to any 
 specific date by this patch installation. It is set to null value which 
 effectively turns off the functionality delivered by the patch. This is 
 because the effective date for appropriate legislation (and funding) for 
 this functionality is unknown at the time of the patch release.
  
 Note: When the government passes the legislation that affects copays for 
 patients with active Category I (national) High Risk for Suicide Patient 
 Record flag and the effective date becomes known to stakeholders of the 
 SHRPE project, the activation patch IB*2.0*629 will be released to 
 activate the functionality.

 Post-Installation Instructions:
  
 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------------
 Due to the complexity of this patch (because of the data dictionary 
 changes), it is not recommended for back-out. However, in the event that
 a site decides to back-out this patch, the site should contact the 
 National Service Desk (NSD) to submit a ticket; the development team will
 assist with the process.
 The Back-Out Procedure consists of restoring routines, and removing 
 manually each new Data Definition (DD) component introduced by the patch. 
 The back-out is to be performed by persons with programmer-level access,
 and in conjunction with the SHRPE Team.
  
 Routines
 --------
 The pre-patch versions of routines can be restored by using backup 
 MailMan message that should be created during installation.
  
 Note: The routines can be modified by another patch that follows the 
 IB*2.0*614 and released after the installation of the IB*2.0*614. In this
 case restoring routines from the backup MailMan messages might cause 
 issues. It is recommended that the sites contact the development team and
 the National VistA Support team after for specific solutions to their
 unique problems.
  
 File/Field additions
 -----------------
 The new SHRPE ACTIVATION DATE field (#70.02) of the file IB SITE 
 PARAMETERS (#350.9) can be deleted by using the standard FileMan utility
 option MODIFY FILE ATTRIBUTES.
