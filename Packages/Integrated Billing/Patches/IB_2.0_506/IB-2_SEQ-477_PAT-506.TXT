Description:
============

  
 This Integrated Billing (IB) patch introduces substantial changes to 
 Veterans Health Information Systems & Technology Architecture (VistA)'s
 electronic Insurance Verification (eIV) eligibility inquiry and
 response processing in order to meet the Committee on Operating Rules for 
 Information Exchange (CORE) Operating Rules.
  
  
 Complete list of patch items:
  
 1.  Revised the insurance buffer views and actions.
  
     a) The new default view for those who select the option PROCESS
        INSURANCE BUFFER [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS] is the "Complete
        Buffer".  The "Complete Buffer" view consists of a list of all
        insurance buffer entries that have the status of 'ENTERED'.
  
     b) Added a new insurance buffer view "Failure Buffer", which consists
        of a list of all entries that have the status of 'ENTERED' and has
        the eIV symbol of "!".
  
     c) The insurance buffer view "Future Appointments" has been removed.
  
     d) The action (VE) VERIFY ENTRY has been removed.
  
     e) A new action (ES) ESCALATE ENTRY has been introduced with this
        patch.  More details regarding this action are listed below.
  
 2.  The ability to escalate an insurance buffer entry was introduced with
     this patch.
  
     a) Two new security keys were added to VistA as a result of this
        patch. If a user selects the option PROCESS INSURANCE BUFFER
        [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS] and they have neither of the new
        security keys (IB INSURANCE COMPANY EDIT and IB GROUP PLAN EDIT),
        then the only insurance buffer records that are displayed to them
        would be entries for eIV confirmed active policies ("+" entries)
        when the patient in that record has an active policy on file in
        VistA.  Other active policies marked with an "$" eIV symbol will
        not be displayed to these users.
  
     b) Only users with neither of the new security keys (IB INSURANCE
        COMPANY EDIT and IB GROUP PLAN EDIT), may use the new action
        (ES) ESCALATE ENTRY within the option PROCESS INSURANCE BUFFER
        [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS].
  
     c) The "+" eIV symbol of insurance buffer entries that have been
        escalated using the new action (ES) ESCALATE ENTRY, will be
        replaced with an "$" eIV symbol.
  
 3.  Disabled the ability to create a new Insurance Company and/or a new
     Group/Plan in VistA through the option PROCESS INSURANCE BUFFER [IBCN
     INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS].
  
 4.  The name of the VistA file that stores the records for the Insurance
     Buffer has been renamed from the "INSURANCE BUFFER" to the
     "INSURANCE VERIFICATION PROCESSOR".  The file number and file layout
     remain the same.  The patch includes the DATE ENTERED (#355.33,.01)
     field although it was not changed, in order for KIDS to update the
     file name of the file #355.33 on the system where this patch is being
     installed.
  
 5.  Modified the daily eIV registration message that is automatically sent
     by VistA via a Health Level 7 (HL7) message to the Financial Service
     Center (FSC) in Austin, TX.  The updated message now includes
     additional data regarding the site's current eIV Site Parameter
     settings.
  
 6.  Modified the eIV Site Parameters that are viewed/edited using the
     option MCCR SITE PARAMETER DISPLAY/EDIT [IBJ MCCR SITE PARAMETERS].
  
     a) The value of the existing FRESHNESS DAYS field (#350.9,51.01),
        which controls the days between electronic re-verification checks,
        is now controlled by FSC through HL7 messages. This field may no
        longer be edited using the option MCCR SITE PARAMETER DISPLAY/EDIT
        [IBJ MCCR SITE PARAMETERS].
  
     b) The existing TIMEOUT DAYS field (#350.9,51.05) which controls the
        number of days between when an eIV inquiry is sent to FSC and when
        the eIV system determines that FSC did not send an eIV response in
        time.  The value of this existing field is now controlled by FSC
        through HL7 messages.
  
     c) The new RETRY FLAG field (#350.9,51.26) which controls whether
        VistA will retransmit an eIV inquiry if an eIV response is not
        received from FSC within the value of the TIMEOUT DAYS
        (#350.9,51.05).  This flag is controlled by FSC.
  
     d) The value of the existing field HL7 RESPONSE PROCESSING
        (#350.9,51.13) is no longer displayed within the eIV Site
        Parameters.  The value of this field may no longer be edited using
        the option MCCR SITE PARAMETER DISPLAY/EDIT [IBJ MCCR SITE
        PARAMETERS].
  
 7.  Modified VistA's retry methodology (resending inquiries to FSC)
     so that any payer's eIV response will be considered a final
     response to the eIV inquiry.  Prior to this change, payer's eIV
     response could result in an eIV inquiry being resent to the payer
     (with no modifications to the eIV inquiry) every few days without
     actually providing an answer to the eligibility inquiry itself.
  
 8.  The option INSURANCE COMPANY ENTRY/EDIT [IBCN INSURANCE CO EDIT] has
     been locked with the new security key IB INSURANCE COMPANY EDIT.
  
 9.  The ability to add a new group/plan through the option PATIENT
     INSURANCE INFO VIEW/EDIT [IBCN PATIENT INSURANCE] has been locked
     with the new security key IB GROUP PLAN EDIT.
  
 10. The option EIV RESPONSE REPORT [IBCNE IIV RESPONSE REPORT] has been
     modified to include the associated eligibility benefit information.
  
 11. For the following options, the display of eligibility benefits has
     been modified with this patch to include a summary of key elements of
     data when available.  This summary will contain the Coverage Status
     and Coverage Type for all payers that send this information in their
     eIV response. When the software determines that the eIV eligibility
     data from Medicare payers indicate possible other insurance for that
     patient, this information will be included in the summary of key data
     elements. This change to the display of eligibility information
     applies to the following options:
  
  
     a) PROCESS INSURANCE BUFFER [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS]
  
     b) PATIENT INSURANCE INFO VIEW/EDIT [IBCN PATIENT INSURANCE]
  
     c) EIV RESPONSE REPORT [IBCNE IIV RESPONSE REPORT]
  
     d) THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY]
  
 12. The EIV STATISTICAL REPORT [IBCNE IIV STATISTICAL REPORT] was modified
     to include 'Escalated' records in the insurance buffer breakout of the
     eIV symbols.
  
 13. Increased the length of field ORIGINAL SUBSCRIBER ID (#365.1,1.05)
     from 20 to 80 characters.
  
 14. Increased the length of field HL7 SUBSCRIBER ID FIELD (#365.1,.16)
     from 20 to 80 characters.

 Patch Installation:
                        
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Two new security keys were added as a result of this patch.  These keys
 need to be assigned to the appropriate folks as determined by the site.
  
  a) The security key IB INSURANCE COMPANY EDIT is to be assigned to users
     who are authorized to add new insurance companies in VistA.
  
  b) The security key IB GROUP PLAN EDIT is to be assigned to users who are
     authorized to add new group plans and individual plans in VistA.
  
  
 There is a post install routine, IBY506PO that is included in this patch.
 After the patch has been installed the post install routine may be deleted
 by the site.
  
 1.  Initializes several eIV site Parameters
  
 2.  Loops through the IIV TRANSMISSION QUEUE file (#365.1) and performs
     the following for all entries with a TRANSMISSION STATUS (#365.1,.04)
     that has a value of HOLD.
  
     a) Changes the TRANSMISSION STATUS (#365.1,.04) to COMMUNICATION
        FAILURE.
  
     b) Identifies all associated entries in the IIV RESPONSE file (#365)
        and changes the TRANSMISSION STATUS (#365,.06) to COMMUNICATION
        FAILURE unless it currently has the status of RESPONSE RECEIVED.
  
     c) Identifies any associated insurance buffer entry and changes the
        eIV symbol to be "#" and indicate that a communication failure
        occurred.
  
  
 3.  Adds two new entries to the existing IIV STATUS TABLE (#365.15)
  
 4.  A one-time subscriber update utility must be scheduled upon 
     installation of the patch. Unless the installation is queued, the 
     post-install will prompt the installer of the patch to schedule this
     activity for off-hours.  If the installation is queued, the new update
     utility will be scheduled for tomorrow at 9 PM.  NOTE: This part of 
     the process does NOT require that IB users be off the system, or 
     un-scheduling of the eIV Nightly Process [IBCNE IIV BATCH PROCESS] 
     option.  A message will be sent to the MailMan mailbox of the installer,
     upon successful completion of the subscriber update process.  It is 
     recommended that one look for the MailMan message 24 hours after the 
     process is scheduled to run.
  
     The subject of the message will be "Subscriber Update Has Completed".
