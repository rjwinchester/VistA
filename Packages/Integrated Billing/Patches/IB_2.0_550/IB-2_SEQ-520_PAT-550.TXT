 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  1. The Patient Release of Information [IBCNR RELEASE OF INFORMATION] 
     option contains actions to add a new ROI and to view/edit an existing ROI. 
     These actions were modified to allow the user to enter any date for the 
     expiration date as long as it is after the effective date of the ROI.
  
  2. The e-Pharmacy Menu [IBCNR E-PHARMACY MENU] contains a new report option
     of RER ROI Expiration Report [IBCNR ROI EXPIRATION REPORT] without
     requiring a security key.
  
  3. The new ROI Expiration Report [IBCNR ROI EXPIRATION REPORT] will prompt
     the user for the following:
  
        Beginning Expiration Date
        Ending Expiration Date
        Status of (A)ctive, (I)nactive, or (B)oth
  
     The beginning expiration date has a default value of T-180 and the ending
     expiration date has a default value of T+60. 
  
  4. The new ROI Expiration Report [IBCNR ROI EXPIRATION REPORT] will display
     patient name, insurance name, date of death, effective date, expiration
     date, date added and the drug name. The report is sorted by expiration
     date in reverse chronological order.
  
  5. The Group Plan Worksheet Report [IBCNR GROUP PLAN WORKSHEET] will display
     the VA Plan ID instead of the Pharmacy Plan.
  
  6. The option Match Multiple Group Plans [IBCNR GROUP PLAN MATCH] will
     display the VA Plan ID instead of the Pharmacy Plan.
  
  7. The option Match Group Plan to a Pharmacy [IBCNR PLAN MATCH] will display
     the VA Plan ID instead of the Pharmacy Plan.
  
  8. IB Billing Determination will use the new ePharmacy Billable fields to
     assess billable status of the ePharmacy prescription.
  
  9. IB Billing Determination will use the new field called Sensitive Diagnosis
     Drug to determine drugs used exclusively to treat a sensitive diagnosis
     and will examine the system to find a Release of Information (ROI) record
     on file to determine if the drug is billable or not.
  
 10. When the system automatically populates the non-billable reason and the
     associated free text ROI reason, the system will use "ROI NOT OBTAINED"
     and free text reason "NO ACTIVE/VALID ROI FOR DRUG OR INSURANCE".
  
 11. The IB back billing processes shall use the same date of service algorithm
     used in outpatient pharmacy and in ECME. A claim can be back-billed
     through Claims Tracking and the action to Generate ECME Rx Bills.
  
 12. The IB Billing Event Log shall contain new drug file fields in the finish
     event for billing events that do not generate a claim because of
     non-billable determination.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named 
 POST^IBY550PO.  The purpose of the post-install routine is to:
  
  a. Remove the references to the Payer file (365.12) from the ePharmacy PLAN
     file (366.03). Both the data and the field definition are removed. 
  b. Remove all E-PHARM payer application data from the Payer file (365.12).
     ePharmacy does not use the Payer file.
  c. Remove the E-PHARM entry from the payer application dictionary file
     (365.13).
  
 The post-install routine is automatically deleted by the system if allowed by 
 your Kernel site parameters configuration. You may delete this routine if the 
 installation was successful and it is not automatically deleted by KIDS.
