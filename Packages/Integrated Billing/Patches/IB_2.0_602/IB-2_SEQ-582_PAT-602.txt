Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements of the Medical Care
 Collection Fund (MCCF) Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Transaction 
 Application Suite (TAS) Phase 2 project.
  
  
 1. Added the ability for a VistA user to expire all subscriber policies
    attached to an insurance group plan without the need to move them to
    another plan. The user can also choose to inactivate the plan after 
    the expiration process has completed. A bulletin detailing the changes
    is sent to both the user initiating the process and the
    "IB NEW INSURANCE" mail group. A new option was added,
    "Expire Group Plan" [IBCN EXPIRE GROUP SUBSCRIBERS] with synonym [XPIR]
    to the PATIENT INSURANCE MENU [IBCN INSURANCE MGMT MENU].
  
    Note: If a user enters only two digits for the expiration date of the
    policy the software translates it as the year only. For example, "19"
    will be translated to "00/00/19".
  
 2. Adjusted the VistA Third Party Joint Inquiry option (TPJI) to correctly
    display the date of death (DoD) information in the header so it is no
    longer truncated when the patient name is extra-long.
  
 3. Enhanced these Excel formatted reports to include the same identifying
    header information (other than "Page:" and page number) as their Report
    formatted counterparts:  
  
    a. "eIV Payer Link Report" [IBCNE IIV PAYER LINK REPORT]
    b. "eIV Response Report" [IBCNE IIV RESPONSE REPORT]
    c. "Insurance Buffer Activity" [IBCN OUTPUT INS BUFF ACTIVITY]
    d. "Insurance Buffer Employee" [IBCN OUTPUT INS BUFF EMPLOYEE]
    e. "Verification of No Coverage Report" [IBCN NO COVERAGE VERIFIED]
    f. "User Edit Report" [IBCN USER EDIT RPT]
    g. "Generate Insurance Company Listings" 
       [IBCN ID DUP INSURANCE ENTRIES]
    h. "List New Not Verified Policies" [IBCN LIST NEW NOT VER]
  
 4. Adjusted the VistA software that purges eIV related inquiries and 
    responses to correctly calculate the earliest possible purge date to
    display to the user. IIV TRANSMISSION QUEUE (#365.1) file (TQ) records
    linked to IIV Response File (#365) records whose "Do Not Purge" field
    (#365,.11) is set to "1" (YES) will no longer be considered.  
    Additionally, when examining IIV Response File (#365) records for
    purging, VistA was modified to remove responses that have a TQ pointer
    that points to a non-existent TQ record.
  
 5. Adjusted the VistA software for the Fee Patient Inquiry [FBAA 
    PATIENT INQUIRY] option, Preregister a Patient [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER 
    OPTION] option and Register a Patient [DG REGISTER PATIENT] option to 
    verify the proper field size for the Medicare (WNR) Subscriber ID and 
    describe those requirements for the user via help text.

 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 The post install will loop through the IIV RESPONSE file (#365) searching
 for any records where the DATE/TIME CREATED (#.08) field is not populated.
 For those records that were identified with this scenario the DATE/TIME 
 CREATED (#.08) field will be set to the same value of the DATE/TIME
 RECEIVED (#365,.07) field if it is populated. Otherwise, the DATE/TIME
 CREATED field will be set to NOW. If any of these records were created 
 within the past 6 months (TODAY-182) up to 5 of them can be included on 
 the email referenced in the paragraph below.
  
 The post install will also locate any abnormal IIV TRANSMISSION QUEUE
 (#365.1) records (TQ). For any of those found that are older than
 TODAY-182 (aka T-182), the abnormal TQ record along with any corresponding
 IIV RESPONSE (#365) record will be deleted. For any abnormal TQ records
 found within T-182 through T-14, an email is sent to the eInsurance
 team (vhaeinsurancerr@domain.ext) listing the TQ internal record number of the
 first 10 entries discovered along with a total count. Additionally, if no
 abnormal records were discovered, an email will still be sent to notify
 the eInsurance team that none were found. The purpose of the email is to
 provide the eInsurance team a sample of records (if any were found) that
 could point to a potential problem with the existing eInsurance software.
  
 This is what constitutes an abnormal TQ record:
   a. Any TQ record without a DATE/TIME CREATED (#365.1, .06)
  
   b. Any TQ record without a QUERY FLAG (#365.1,.11)
  
   c. Any TQ record with a QUERY FLAG (#365.1,.11) that is set to "I"
      (Identification) and WHICH EXTRACT (#365.1,.1) is not equal to
      "EICD".
  
   d. Any TQ record that has a TRANSMISSION STATUS (#365.1, .04) that is 
      not equal to "Response Received" and not equal to "Communication
      Failure" and not equal to "Cancelled".  There is no reason for any TQ
      entry more than 6 months old to have any status other than those
      listed.
