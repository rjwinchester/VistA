Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements of the Medical Care
 Collection Fund (MCCF) Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Transaction 
 Application Suite (TAS) Phase 1 project.
  
 The post install routine uses IA #4677.
  
 Complete List of patch items:
  1. Modified VistA to properly file an eligibility response when that
     response is associated with a payer name that begins with numeric
     characters.
  
  2. Modified the excel version of the eIV Payer Link Report [IBCNE IIV 
     PAYER LINK REPORT] option to display the correct value for the locally
     active status column, LOCAL ACTIVE (#365.12, .03), so that eInsurance
     users have an accurate report and know what payers they may need to
     update.
  
  3. On the first of the month, the nightly job will automatically purge 
     eIV related inquiries and responses so that outdated responses are
     removed and database space is maximized. If the automatic purge
     process can't be completed, the proper authorities will be notified
     via email message to mailman group "IBCNE EIV MESSAGE" and outlook
     address VHAEINSURANCERR@domain.ext .
  
  4. Modified VistA to display the additional one letter Source of
     Information (SOI) codes associated with the SOURCE OF INFORMATION FILE
     (#355.12) on the screens for the Process Insurance Buffer 
     [IBCN INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS] option (insurance buffer). This allows
     the user to determine how the insurance buffer entry was created and
     assist with work-list sorting. The help text has been updated to
     include the new SOI codes.
  
  5. Removed the ability to directly create insurance policies on the
     patient's insurance records from outside of the IB package. Disallowed
     users from creating an entry in the INSURANCE TYPE sub-file (#2.312)
     within the PATIENT file (#2) via the Fee Patient Inquiry [FBAA
     PATIENT INQUIRY] option, via the Preregister a Patient [DGPRE
     PRE-REGISTER OPTION] option and via the Register a Patient
     [DG REGISTER PATIENT] option. Using those same options, users can now
     create an insurance buffer entry for any insurance company, including
     "MEDICARE (WNR)".
  
  6. Enhanced the ability to manage auto match entries, a user holding 
     security key IBCNE EIV MAINTANENCE can access the Enter/Edit Auto
     Match Entries [IBCNE AUTO MATCH ENTER/EDIT] option to delete existing
     entries within that option. Users who do not hold security key 
     IBCNE EIV MAINTANENCE cannot access the Enter/Edit Auto Match Entries
     [IBCNE AUTO MATCH ENTER/EDIT] option.
  
  7. In the IIV RESPONSE (#365) file, capture the patient's internal entry 
     number for the INSURANCE TYPE sub-file (#2.312) within the Patient
     (#2) file to accurately track when an auto-update successfully updates
     a patient's policy. The eIV Auto Update Report [IBCNE EIV UPDATE
     REPORT] option will utilize the data to more accurately report on all
     auto updated policies for a given time frame. Manual user verification
     will no longer impact the report results. Adjusted the daily Financial
     Service Center (FSC) registration message to report only yesterday's
     data to protect against duplication.   
  
  8. Modified VistA to update the VERIFIED BY field (#2.312, 1.04) and the 
     LAST EDITED BY field (#2.312, 1.06) in a timely manner with accurate
     data so that downstream processes and reports contain the proper
     information. 
  
  9. Persisted the Source of Information (#2.312, 1.09) field so that it 
     always reflects the original SOI specifying how the policy was
     identified. This will facilitate generating return on investment
     reports that associate dollars collected with the source used to
     identify the insurance policy. Added a unique SOI identifier,
     "MYVA HEALTH JOURNAL", that may be utilized to augment source
     reporting.
  
 10. Modified VistA to generate a SOI of "eIV" from the eIV Appointment 
     extract to be saved in the IIV TRANSMISSION QUEUE (#365.1) file in
     field SOURCE OF INFORMATION (#3.02) so that outbound Health Level
     Seven messages can carry the SOI and FSC can persist the data
     accurately and use it for data analysis.
  
 11. When moving subscribers to a different insurance plan, VistA allows 
     the user to add/edit the BANKING IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (#355.3, 6.02)
     and the PROCESSOR CONTROL NUMBER (#355.3,6.03) to ensure that those
     fields are populated in the destination group insurance plan.
  
 12. Vista was updated to prevent the Insurance buffer from being 
     auto-updated when the Source of Information code (#2.312, 1.09) is
     "Contract Services".
