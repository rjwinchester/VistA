 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC000001026311 Integrated Billing - Other
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Chief Business Office has requested a new entry - LABORATORY SERVICES
 PROVIDED TO NON-PATIENTS added to the MCCR Utility file (#399.1) for UB-04
 Bill Classification that will replace the old bill classification 4-HUMANIT.
 EMERG (OPT/ESRD) on the second digit type of bill.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 A post-init routine was created to add a new entry to the MCCR Utility file 
 for UB-04 Bill Classification as detailed below:
  
 UB-04 BILL CLASSIFICATION                         CODE  LOCATION OF CARE
 ---------------------------------------------     ----  ----------------
 LABORATORY SERVICES PROVIDED TO NON-PATIENTS       4         1,3
  
 The software was also modified to automatically set up the UB-04 bill 
 classification to 4-LABORATORY SERVICES PROVIDED TO NON-PATIENTS
 in the UB-04 BILL CLASSIFICATION field (#.25) of the BILL/CLAIMS file (#399)
 when the bill is initial created and the BILLING EVENT INFORMATION SOURCE:
 4- HUMANITARIAN EMERGENCY (OPT./ESRD) is selected in the Enter/Edit Billing
 Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] option.
  
 Routines: IB20P532, IBCU4
  
 2. INC000001041697 Integrated Billing - Other
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The display messages for the chiropractic-related dates and the statement
 covers dates contain several misspellings (for an example: Cannot proceed
 the 'Start Date'!) and they can display in the [IB EDIT BILLING INFO]
 Enter/Edit Billing Information option when the dates entered don't go
 through the input transform checks successfully.  
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 The software was modified to correct the misspellings in the messages 
 displayed for these fields: STATEMENT COVERS FROM (#151), STATEMENT COVERS
 TO (#152), LAST XRAY DATE (#245), DATE OF INITIAL TREATMENT (#246) and
 DATE OF ACUTE MANIFESTATION (#247) of the BILL/CLAIMS file (#399) if the
 input transform checks are failed. The misspelling in the help prompt of
 the LAST XRAY DATE (#245) field was corrected as well below.
