The XUNOTRIG flag controls whether this cross-reference is executed. The

form XUEXISTING USER and the XUNEW USER forms both set the XUNOTRIG flag,
"IX",200,200,"ANAME",.1,6,0)

transform returns in the XLFNC array the component parts of the name. This
"IX",200,200,"ANAME",.1,12,0)

the fields are edited, the cross-reference logic will set an index entry
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,5,0)

None of the field-type cross-reference values are used as subscripts in

the index, since we are only interested in recording the IENs of the

records that are edited and the date the index entry is set. A separate
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,15,0)
queuable option will loop through the entries in this index, and send via
"IX",200,200,"ATR",.1,16,0)

If you are filling in this field for an X.400 address, it is a standard

field.  If, however, you are filling in this field for an SMTP address,

you must fill in the third level of the domain.  For example, the third
"^DD",200,200.005,5,21,4,0)
level of the domain 'SILVER.FORUM.DOMAIN.EXT' is the string after the second
