 The purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements of the Medical Care
 Collection Fund (MCCF) eInsurance Compliance Phase 3 project related to
 Integrated Billing (IB). eInsurance provides Insurance identification
 and verification which is vital to the success of the Department of
 Veterans Affairs (VA) revenue collection process. Accurate insurance
 information is needed to effectively submit claims and collect payments
 from third-party payers for medical care and services provided to
 Veterans by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
  
 The following features of the IB software will be affected by this
 project:
  
 1) Electronic Insurance Verification (eIV):

            coverages.

            plans.
        o   eIV Appointment extract will exclude specific types of
            coverages.
        o   eIV Appointment extract will exclude specific types of
            plans.
        o   eIV Request Electronic Insurance Inquiry will allow inquiries
            for deceased patients, but will not use Date of Death (DOD) as
            the service date.
  
 *      eIV processing and transmission:
        o   eIV Auto Update will only update active policies.

            domain name.

 hours when there is minimal activity on the system and there are no
 Integrated Billing users on the system.

 been completed, as a task has been queued to run in the background and it
