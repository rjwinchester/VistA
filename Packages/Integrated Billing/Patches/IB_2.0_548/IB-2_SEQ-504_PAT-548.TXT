 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1. INC000001106647 Integrated Billing IPV6 Conversion
  
 Problem:
 ========
 In preparation for the VA's transition from IPv4 to IPv6 the IB package 
 will require modifications to make it IPv6 ready.
  
 Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the latest version of the Internet 
 Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification
 and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across 
 the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force 
 (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address 
 exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4.
  
 Vista is only compatible with Ipv4 currently and this effort is to prepare
 for Ipv6 compatibility.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The length of the TCP/IP ADDRESS (#9.03) field and CLAIMSMANAGER TCP/IP
 ADDRESS (#50.05) field are increased to accommodate with IPv6 address  
 formats in the IB SITE PARAMETERS (#350.9) file data dictionary.
