Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH
  - Routine

Description:
============

 *** Note:  This patch has a mandatory 3 day installation compliance.
  
 This patch contains a fix for the installed patch IB*2.0*528. The 
 IB*2.0*528 patch renamed the existing security key IBCNE IIV AUTO MATCH to
 the new security key IBCNE EIV MAINTENANCE at the sites. All users that
 held the IBCNE IIV AUTO MATCH key now hold the new security key IBCNE EIV
 MAINTENANCE.
  
 The installed patch IB*2.0*528 is dependent upon this emergency patch 
 IB*2.0*566. This IB*2.0*566 patch will rename the old security key "IBCNE 
 IIV AUTO MATCH" to "IBCNE EIV MAINTENANCE" that currently exist at the 
 sites within two existing IB routines (IBCNEAMC and IBCNEUT6). Without 
 the installation of this IB*2.0*566 patch users are not able to enter, 
 edit, and manage entries found in the Insurance Company Auto Match file.
