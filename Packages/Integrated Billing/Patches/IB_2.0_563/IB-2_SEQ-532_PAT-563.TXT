Subject: FIXED MEDICATION COPAYMENT TIERS (FMCT)

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch will provide enhancements to the Integrated Billing package 
 for Fixed Medication Copayment Tiers (FMTC) project. It supports the 
 redesign and/or enhancement of the current structure of charges for 
 first-party outpatient medication copayments to treat non-service 
 connected conditions.  This project brings the Department of Veterans 
 Affairs (VA) into compliance with the Proposed Rule 38 Code of Federal 
 Regulations (CFR) Part 17 Copayments for Medications.
  
 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along
 with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    To be released in a host file:
    National Drug File (NDF) V. 4.0                    PSN*4*492
    Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0              PSS*1*200
  
    To be released as a host file:
    Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) V. 7.0                    PSO*7*460
    Integrated Billing (IB) V. 2.0                     IB*2*563
  
    To be released as a standalone forum patch on or about 1/6/2017:
    Accounts Receivable (AR) V. 4.5                    PRCA*4.5*312
  
  
 This rulemaking eliminates the Medical Consumer Price Index (CPI-P) 
 formula used to calculate future rate increases and establishes the 
 following three classes of medications, identified as Tier 1, Tier 2, and 
 Tier 3, beginning February 27, 2017:
  
         Tier 1 = $5 for a 30-day or less supply of a medication; 
         Tier 2 = $8 for a 30-day or less supply of a medication; and 
         Tier 3 = $11 for a 30-day or less supply of a medication.  
  
 In addition to the rule, Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) made the 
 addition of Tier 0 for excluded and exempt products with no copayment.
  
 In order to comply with the Federal regulations, modifications are 
 included in these patches to support fixed copayment amounts depending on 
 the class of the medication (Tier 0, Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3).
  
 The VA wide Outpatient Medication Copayment Cap per calendar year which 
 was for only Priority Groups 2-6 is being extended to include Priority 
 Groups 7-8.  The new Outpatient Medication Copayment Cap effective 
 January 1, 2017 will be $700 for all Priority Groups subject to 
 Outpatient Medication Copayments (2-8).
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
  - Rate files will be updated to store tiered copayments and their new
    rates effective February 27, 2017.  To ensure backward compatibility,
    the old rates are being associated with the default tier of 2.
  
  - Medication copayment cap files will be updated to store the new cap
    that applies to PG 2-8 effective January 1, 2017.
  
  - All automated creation of outpatient medication copayments will utilize
    the new tiered rates based on the drug dispensed and designated in the
    National Drug File software package.
  
  - Manually created copayment charges will now prompt for a prescription
    date, if on the date entered there are multiple tiers available for
    rate selection the user will be prompted for the applicable tier.
  
  - The option to locally update rate files is being enhanced to support
    outpatient medication copayment tiers.
  
  - Provide support for the Accounts Receivable (AR) package to lookup 
    potential charges on prescriptions that have not yet been released
    with the potential charge amount based on the prescription tier value.
