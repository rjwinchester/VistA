 2. INC000001113794 Integrated Billing-Functionality Issue:
  
 Problem:
 --------
 ICD-10 procedure codes on the bill form page 2 of the printed bill are
 truncated. It happens when the bill contains over 6 procedures codes and
 the procedure codes on page 2 have 7 characters in length.  The current 
 date definition is resulting in the procedure codes output of only 6 
 characters on the second page.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 A post-init routine IB20P543 was created to increase the length from 6 to 7
 in the data element: OTHER PROC DATE 5 (FL-74E/2) of the IB FORM SKELETON 
 DEFINITION file (#364.6).
