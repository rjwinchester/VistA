 1. R18501755FY18 Auto-remove the TC modifier for Medicare claims
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Community Care Office (OCC) has requested Technical Component (TC)
    modifier be automatically removed from any procedure on institutional
    bills for Medicare only, in the Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT
    BILLING INFO] option. For any other payer scenario, append the TC
    modifier where appropriate.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine IBCU7A was modified to automatically remove the TC modifier from
    any procedure on institutional bills for Medicare, if the payer
    sequence is primary, the primary payer or the secondary payer is
    Medicare, and the only professional charge on the procedure is 26
    modified.
  
    A POST-INIT routine IB20P619 was created to remove the TC modifier for
    Medicare on existing bills based on above requirements in the BILL/CLAIMS
    (#399) file.
