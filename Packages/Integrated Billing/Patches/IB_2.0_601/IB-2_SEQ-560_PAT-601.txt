 **************************************************************************
                     PLEASE NOTE - THIS PATCH HAS A SHORTENED
                            COMPLIANCE DATE OF 15 DAYS 
 **************************************************************************
  
 The purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements of the Medical Care
 Collection Fund (MCCF) Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Transaction 
 Application Suite (TAS) Phase 1 project.
  
 This Integrated Billing (IB) patch introduces changes to VistA's 
 Electronic Claims processing to meet the Committee on Operating 
 Rules for Information Exchange (CORE) Operating Rules.
  
 Complete List of patch items:
  
 1. Modified VistA to use the proper subscriber's Date of Birth (DOB) 
    field, "INSURED'S DOB" (#2.312, 3.01), when creating the Health Level 7
    (HL7) inquiry to facilitate electronic Insurance Verification (eIV) 
    auto-update. Populate the 270 inquiry with the DOB from the Patient 
    Insurance sub-file, "INSURED'S DOB" (#2.312, 3.01), so that eligibility
    inquiries will be sent with this subscriber's DOB and the subsequent
    271 response will be returned and auto-update successfully.
  
  
 2. When processing master file add (MAD) and master file update (MUP) 
    table update messages from the Financial Services Center (FSC) 
    Development, implement acknowledgement (ACK) and negative 
    acknowledgement (NAK) messages for table additions and table updates to
    improve VistA control and consistency.
  
  
 3. Populate the outbound HL7 message with the 'Source of Information' 
    Code (#2.312, 1.09) from each Insurance Verification Processor (buffer)
    (#355.12) entry to FSC, facilitating VistA data analysis.
  
 4. Two new entries were added to the IIV STATUS TABLE (#365.15): "M1"
    and "U3".
  
 5. Remove the hard stop for a valid Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) 
    format on claims to allow for use of MBI.
