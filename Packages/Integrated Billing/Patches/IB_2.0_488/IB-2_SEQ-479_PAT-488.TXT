 Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 -------------------------------------
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from
 ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Hines          ftp.domain.ext   <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  
  
 The documentation will be in the form of Adobe Acrobat files.
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library
 at: http://www4.domain.ext/vdl/

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 ****Important Note: There is one **MANDATORY** pre-installation
     activity associated with this install.
  
 The IB Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission queue PRIOR to
 the installation of this patch. ***
  
 The site IRM would coordinate with the Billing Department to insure that 
 the 837 extract/transmission queue is empty. The instructions to empty
 the queue is as follows:
  
 Select the option:   TRANSMIT EDI BILLS - MANUAL [IBCE 837 MANUAL 
 TRANSMIT]
  
   What is the purpose of this option?
    This option is used to by-pass the normal daily/nightly transmission
    queues if the need arises to get the claim to the payer quickly.
  
   When is this option used?
    There are occasions when there is a need to transmit a claim(s)
    immediately instead of waiting for the batching frequency as scheduled
    in the MCCR Site Parameter.  This option will allow sending individual
    claim(s) or all claims in a ready for extract status.
  
   Upon selecting this option you will be prompted with the following:
     Select one of the following:
      A  Transmit (A)LL bills in READY FOR EXTRACT status
      S  Transmit only (S)ELECTED bills
  
   You should select 'A' for ALL
  
 Once the Billing Department has completed the instruction, the Billing
 department is to inform IRM that the patch installation could proceed.
  
 The pre-installation routine, IB488PRE, defines several new error
 messages that are used by the Billing Screens.  These new error
 messages are stored as new entries in the IB ERROR file (#350.8). The
 pre-installation routine also updates the Rate Type File (#399.3) with
 the Electronic Billable Flag for Worker's Compensation.  Lastly, the
 pre-installation routine will delete unused 4010 Output Formatter
 entries.
  
 The post installation routine will recompile the Input Templates for
 the Billing Screens.
