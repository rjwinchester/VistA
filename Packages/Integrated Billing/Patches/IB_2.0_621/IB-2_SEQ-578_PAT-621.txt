Description:
============

 *** Note:  This patch has a mandatory 15 day installation compliance.
  
 *** Note:  This patch cannot be QUEUED.
   
 The purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements of the Medical Care
 Collection Fund (MCCF) Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Transaction 
 Application Suite (TAS) Phase 1 project.
  
  
 Complete List of patch items:
  
  1. Adjusted the VistA software that purges electronic Insurance 
     Verification (eIV) related inquiries and responses, including records
     contained in the new EIV EICD TRACKING (#365.18) file (TRACKING), to
     correctly evaluate the "Do Not Purge" field (#365,.11) found on the
     IIV Response File (#365) (RESPONSE) record. When a candidate RESPONSE
     record contains a "Do Not Purge" field set to "1" (Yes), the RESPONSE
     record, the associated IIV TRANSMISSION QUEUE (#365.1) file (TQ)
     record and the associated EIV EICD TRACKING (#365.18) record will
     be retained. Only those RESPONSE records (plus the associated TQ and
     TRACKING records) that meet the criteria for purging and have a "Do
     Not Purge" field set to "0" (No) will be deleted.
  
     Note: A TRACKING record may point to 1 (one) or more sets of TQ and 
     RESPONSE records. If any RESPONSE record associated with a TRACKING 
     record contains a "Do Not Purge" field set to "1" (Yes) then all 
     associated TQ and RESPONSE records of that TRACKING record will be 
     retained. There is no limit to the number of sets of TQ and RESPONSE 
     records that can be associated with a TRACKING record.
  
  2. VistA has been enhanced to create Electronic Insurance Coverage
     Discovery (EICD) identification inquiries for scheduled patients that
     have no active insurance information. The "No Insurance" extract  
     (which is not visible to the users today) has been recommissioned as
     the "EICD" extract and rewritten to examine upcoming appointments for
     patients without active insurance. The "EICD" extract is displayed to
     the users as the 3rd extract within the option "MCCR SITE PARAMETER
     DISPLAY/ED" [IBJ MCCR SITE PARAMETERS], under the selection of "Ins.
     Verification". Those patients from the "EICD" extract are then 
     forwarded via Health Level Seven (HL7) transactions to the Financial
     Services Center (FSC) which in turn will forward them to our discovery
     service vendor. All identification results (discovered insurance or
     not) are returned to VistA via FSC at which time normal insurance
     verification inquiries may be issued to the proper payers. When
     discovered insurances are for eIV payers that are both locally and
     nationally active, VistA will automatically generate and transmit a
     normal 270 message to the payer for verification. Any identification
     results returned to VistA where the discovered insurance are for a
     non-eIV payer or the eIV payer is not locally/nationally active, will
     be saved to the INSURANCE VERIFICATION PROCESSOR (#355.33) file
     (Buffer) for manual processing via VistA or the third-party software
     ICB (Insurance Capture Buffer).
