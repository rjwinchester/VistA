============

 *************************************************************************
  
 NOTICE:
  
    The patch bundle PRCA IB MCCF EDI 1.0 (IB*2.0*530/PRCA*4.5*303) must
    be installed first, then install two standalone patches, IB*2.0*529
    and PRCA*4.5*304. Patch IB*2.0*529 must be installed before installing
    PRCA*4.5*304. Install all patches close together so that your site has
    all of the features released as part of this enhancement.
  
 *************************************************************************
  
 The Medical ePayments Compliance (Phase 2, Iteration 2) project ensures 
 the Veterans Administrations (VA) compliance with Electronic Funds
 Transfer (EFT) & Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) Operating Rules, and
 enables VA to more effectively use ERA data, resulting in better revenue
 and cash flow management.  It will provide the infrastructure foundation
 for electronic exchange of claim payment information and promotes an
 interoperable system and will reduce the time elapsed between receipt of
 the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) 835 Electronic Remittance Advice
 Transaction and receipt of the Cash Concentration or Disbursement (CCD+)
 transactions.  It will ensure that trace numbers between payments and
 remittances can be used by VA, reducing the level of open accounts
 receivable, allow claim denials to be more quickly addressed, and
 standardizes Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) & ERA enrollment to reduce
 workload burden on VA staff.
  
 This patch contains changes to the ePayments (835 and EFT) program area 
 to ensure compliance. Specifically, enhancements to the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Third Party
 EDI Lockbox module to increase timely and accurate processing of payments
 for electronic pharmacy claims in compliance with Health Insurance
 Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Veterans Health
 Administration (VHA) Fiscal Accounting policies will also be required.  
 The ePayments system is used by Accounts Receivable (AR) staff to process
 payments from third party payers for both medical and pharmacy claims. The
 objectives of the requested ePayments software modifications are to
 expedite accurate payments by enhancing the ePayments software to
 streamline the user's ability to process the pharmacy 835 while:
         
 Complying with HIPAA legislative requirements to meet patient 
 needs and secure Protected Health Information (PHI).
         
 Conducting payment accounting in accordance with the Office of 
 Management and Budget (OMB) directives.
         
 Systematically enforcing VHA Fiscal Accounting policy.
  
 This patch adds the following:
   - Modifies the Insurance Payment Trend Report to accurately identify
     Insurance Companies listed on the report by including their Tax 
     Identification Number.
   - Modifies the Insurance Payment Trend Report to identify
     whether a patient's claim has an ERA attached to it.
   - Adds an Index to the EDI TRANSMISSION BATCH file to allow for easier
     searches
