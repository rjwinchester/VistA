Description:
============

 This patch will provide additional enhancements to the Integrated Billing 
 package beyond what IB*2*563 provided for Fixed Medication Copayment Tiers
 (FMTC) project. It supports the redesign and/or enhancement of the current
 structure of charges for FEE first-party outpatient medication copayments
 to treat non-service connected conditions which were not included in the
 prior IB*2*563 patch.  This project brings the Department of Veterans
 Affairs (VA) into compliance with the Rule 38 Code of Federal Regulations
 (CFR) Part 17 Copayments for Medications. 
  
 This rulemaking eliminates the Medical Consumer Price Index (CPI-P) 
 formula used to calculate future rate increases and establishes the 
 following three classes of medications, identified as Tier 1, Tier 2, and 
 Tier 3, beginning February 27, 2017:
  
         Tier 1 = $5 for a 30-day or less supply of a medication; 
         Tier 2 = $8 for a 30-day or less supply of a medication; and 
         Tier 3 = $11 for a 30-day or less supply of a medication.  
  
 In order to comply with the Federal regulations, additional rates included
 in this patch to support fixed copayment amounts when being added for FEE
 related services depending on the class of the medication (Tier 0, Tier 1,
 Tier 2, or Tier 3).
  
 This patch contains the following data updates:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
  - Rate files will be updated to store tiered copayments and their new
    rates effective February 27, 2017 for all prior Fee Rx charges.  To
    ensure backward compatibility, the old rates are being associated with
    the default tier of 2.
  
  - Manually created medication copayment charges for FEE will prompt for a
    tier if on the date entered there are multiple tiers available for rate
    selection.
