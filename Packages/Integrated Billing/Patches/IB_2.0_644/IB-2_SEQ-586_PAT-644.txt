 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC3318511 - Insurance claims with multiple line items/dates on a
                 single bill are not transmitting electronically properly.
    
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Insurance claims on the bill in the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
    Transmission, displays only the first date of service listed on all
    service line items instead of an individual date of service for each
    service line item.
    
  
    Resolution:
    ------------
    Routine IBCEFG1 was modified to pull the procedure date to the 'Service
    Date From' field for each service line item for the EDI transmission if
    it can be determined by the associated procedure, otherwise it will use
    the start date of the statement on the bill.
    
  
 2. INC3333745 -  Billing Facility Naming discrepancy resulting in denied
                  claims for NCCPAC.
                
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The BILLING FACILITY NAME (#200) field in the INSTITUTION (#4) file 
    does not display to the correct uniform billing form,
    UB-04 FL-1, resulting in claims being denied by payers.
  
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Post-init routine IB20P644, was created to modify the
    FORMAT CODE (#1) field in the IB FORM FIELD CONTENT (#364.7) file
    for the BILLING PROVIDER NAME (FL-1/1) form field. If the
    BILLING FACILITY NAME (#200) field of the INSTITUTION (#4) file
    exists, the Facility Name will be used. If not, the NAME (#.01) field 
    of the INSTITUTION (#4) file will be used for the UB-04 FL-1 uniform 
    billing form.
