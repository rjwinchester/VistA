 IMPORTANT INSTALLATION NOTE:
 ----------------------------
 There are three patches associated with this project - PRCA*4.5*315,
 IB*2.0*568 and PSO*7.0*463. All three patches are to be installed as
 PackMan files.  There is no bundle.
  
 The three patches for this project MUST be installed in this order:
 1.  PRCA*4.5*315
 2.  IB*2.0*568
 3.  PSO*7.0*463
  
 Description
 -----------
 The Chief Business Office (CBO) is requesting system enhancements to
 The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) Integrated Billing (IB), Accounts Receivable (AR), and Outpatient
 Pharmacy (PSO) software modules.
  
 The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of
 Information & Technology (OI&T), is to provide benefits and services
 to veterans of the United States Armed Forces. In meeting these goals, OIT
 strives to provide high quality, effective, and efficient Information
 Technology (IT) services to those responsible for providing care to the
 veterans at the point-of-care, as well as throughout all the points of the
 veterans' health care. The VA depends on Information
 Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) systems to meet mission goals.
  
 The overall FY16 HAPE Revenue Enhancement project is comprised of three 
 New Service Requests (NSR):
  
 NSR #20150506
 The Revenue Eligibility Enhancements Project effort for the
 (CBO), bundles several NSRs with similar business needs into a single
 requirements document.  Successfully addressing the requirements contained
 within this document will enable the Department of VA to appropriately 
 bill certain subsets of billable events by correcting, automating, or
 enhancing current VistA systems.
  
 NSR #20150507
 The Revenue Operations Enhancements Project combines several NSRs,
 as well. This effort enables the VA to improve revenue operation
 functionality related to repayment plans, late charge capture, bill
 suspension reasons, the billing of deactivated providers, and the display
 of appeal rights and responsibilities on the Veterans Beneficiary travel
 Bill of Collections form.  Implementation of the proposed enhancements 
 will make a significant positive impact on stakeholders and target users.
  
 NSR #20150505
 The Revenue Reporting Enhancements Project will enable the VA to
 improve tracking and reporting of revenue, and will support revenue
 reporting business rules and guidelines.
  
  
 IB*2.0*568 patch enhancements, pertinent to the above NSRs, include:
  
 1.) When generating the RNB (Reasons Not Billable) report, the
 Integrated Billing system shall populate the charges for all types of
 services provided. Charges will not be screened by any billable criteria
 but will indicate the full amount as if the care was to be billed.
  
 2.) The sub-option Claims Tracking Parameter Edit [IBT EDIT TRACKING
 PARAMETERS], that currently has no key, will be locked with a new Security
 Key called IB PARAMETER EDIT.
  
 3.) The option MCCR Site Parameter Display/Edit [IBJ MCCR SITE
 PARAMETERS], which is currently locked with the IB SUPERVISOR Security
 Key, will be instead locked with the new key. NOTE: IV Managers, Billing 
 Managers and other select staff approved to edit through the MCCR SITE
 PARAMETERS option will need to have this key assigned
  
  
 4.) The Integrated Billing system shall create claims tracking entries
 for previously unbilled Prosthetics/DME items when new billable insurance
 is entered into the patient's insurance file.
  
 5.) A new coverage limitation field shall be created in the insurance
 file for Prosthetics.  Like the other existing coverage limitation
 fields in the insurance file (Inpatient, Outpatient, Pharmacy etc.),
 this field will have the following options:
        0=NOT COVERED
        1=COVERED
        2=CONDITIONAL COVERAGE
 Once selected, they will show in the patient insurance file as Yes,
 No, or Conditional.
  
 6.) The system shall automatically assign an RNB [NO PROSTHETIC
 COVERAGE (CV22)] for Prosthetics/DME items if the patient has no coverage
 for Prosthetics in his/her insurance file.
  
 7.) The system shall have a new option to add Prosthetics items to
 Manual and Nightly Claims Tracking.
  
 8.) Users will be able to select Suspended Type from the menu to
 display in the First Party Follow- Up [IBJD FOLLOW-UP FIRST PARTY]
 report.
  
 9.) First Party Follow-Up [IBJD FOLLOW-UP FIRST PARTY] report shall
 be modified to incorporate reason for suspension.
  
 10.) A new warning message will print to the screen in the Enter/Edit
 Billing Information option if an ATTENDING, REFERRING or RENDERING
 Provider has a PERSON CLASS in the NEW PERSON file (#200) that was expired
 at the time of the Date of Service.
  
 11.) On the Third Party Joint Inquiry screen, one (1) character space
 shall be added to the "Type" field so that it will accommodate five
 characters (a one-character classification indicator, a forward slash
 (/), a one-character component indicator, a forward slash (/), and a
 one-character care type) ("X/X/X").  If a bill contains prescriptions,
 then an "R" shall be concatenated to the fifth character sub-type position
 of the "Type" field. If a bill contains prosthetics, then a "P" shall be
 concatenated to fifth character sub-type position of the "Type" field. The
 "Type" field shall contain five (5) characters as follows:
 1. "I" for Inpatient or "O" for Outpatient,
 2. "/" forward slash character
 3. "P" for Professional or "I" for Institutional
 4. "/" forward slash character
 5. "P" for Prosthetics or "R" for Prescriptions
  
 12.) Three new Third Party Insurance Rate Types shall be created in
 the VistA IB system for the billers to choose from when billing for
 encounters. They are as follows:
        HUMANITARIAN REIMB. INS.
        DENTAL REIMB. INS.
        INELIGIBLE REIMB. INS.
  
 13.) Each of the new rate types above will have the 'Insurer' as the
 responsible party.
  
 14.) Billers (revenue staff) should be able to identify any remaining
 charges to the patient after the Third Party payments are received for
 Emergency Humanitarian, Ineligible and Dental services so they can
 accomplish balance billing.

 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 2 
 minutes to install.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options:
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  To Install the Patch, from the Installation Menu, select the Install
     Package(s) option and choose the patch to install. When prompted for
     the INSTALL NAME, enter the patch# (IB*2.0*568).
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//'  You may press return to accept the default answer of 
     NO IF your system rebuilds menu trees nightly using TaskMan. If you 
     do not have this scheduled as a nightly task, you must answer YES to 
     rebuild the menu trees.  This could affect users on the system 
     and your installation time will increase.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//, enter 'NO'
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//, enter 'NO'
