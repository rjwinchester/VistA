Category:

  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 *** Note:  This patch has a mandatory 3 day installation compliance.
  
 The purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements of the Medical Care
 Collection Fund (MCCF) eInsurance Compliance Phase 3 project related to
 Integrated Billing (IB). eInsurance provides Insurance identification
 and verification which is vital to the success of the Department of
 Veterans Affairs (VA) revenue collection process. Accurate insurance
 information is needed to effectively submit claims and collect payments
 from third-party payers for medical care and services provided to
 Veterans by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
  
 The following feature of the IB software will be affected by this
 project:
  
 The VistA software has been updated to re-evaluate the patient's current
 insurance coverage when they are identified in VistA as being deceased.
  
 Note, that if the date of death entered is TODAY or NOW or TODAY-1 then
 the 'COVERED BY HEALTH INSURANCE' field (#2,.3192) will remain at "Y" 
 if they have an active policy on file, as the automated process associated
 with the 'DATE OF DEATH' field (#2,.351) would term that policy with the
 date of death+1.  A term date of TODAY or NOW or TODAY+1 is considered an
 active policy when it is evaluated.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
  
 1. Ticket #R11229286FY17 Inconsistent Data Elements report
  
 Problem:
 -------
 As a result of automated processes in IB*2.0*549, when a patient is
 identified as deceased in VistA the patient's active policies are termed.
 However, the field 'COVERED BY HEALTH INSURANCE' (#2,.3192) is not
 updated to accurately reflect the proper status of the patient's insurance
 coverage.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The VistA software has been updated to re-evaluate the patient's current
 insurance coverage when they are identified in VistA as being deceased.
  
 Note, that if the date of death entered is TODAY or NOW or TODAY-1 then
 the 'COVERED BY HEALTH INSURANCE' field (#2,.3192) will remain at "Y" 
 if they have an active policy on file, as the automated process associated
 with the 'DATE OF DEATH' field (#2,.351) would term that policy with the
 date of death+1.  A term date of TODAY or NOW or TODAY+1 is considered an
 active policy when it is evaluated.
