Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide posted on the 
 Anonymous directory for installation order. This is critical for proper 
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 National Patch Module Patch - DRG Grouper
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use.
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or
 after the ICD-10 Activation Date will use the ICD-10 code set.
 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about
 13,000 ICD-9 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System
 (ICD-10-PCS) procedure codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to
 nearly 87,000. Both systems also expand the number of characters 
 allotted to seven alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include
 the decimal point, which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM
 code set. There is no decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of
 care, so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better
 understand complications, better design clinically robust algorithms,
 and better track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates
 greater specificity and clinical detail to provide information for
 clinical decision making and outcomes research.
  
 The patch ICD*18.0*64 makes the following changes to the Diagnosis 
 Related Group (DRG) application:
  
 - Calculation of DRG code for ICD-10 diagnosis codes and ICD-10 procedure 
 codes
 - Makes ICD-9 DRG Calculation routines compliant with ICD-10 file changes
 - Makes ICD Code Inquiry Option compliant with new Standards and 
 Terminology Services (STS) Application Program Interface (API) changes
 - Added Present on Admission (POA) indicator as part of calculating DRG 
 value
 - Removed hardcoded business rules from DRG Calculation and made the 
 calculating data-driven based on the data downloaded from the Centers for 
 Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) website, and loaded the existing and
 new global files

 Patch Installation
 ==================
  
   
  This patch requires the import global ^ICDLOAD to be installed prior 
  to installation of the patch. The ^ICDLOAD global is delivered in the
  data file ICD_18_64.GBL.
  
  The ICD*18*64 development team obtained the exemption to use $ZU(68,28) 
  in routine ICD1864B from SACC committee on 2/25/2014, in order that the 
  ICDLOAD global can be removed programmatically. The user will not 
  therefore have to delete the global manually.
  
  User will be asked questions prior to installing the patch.
  
  The installation process of the patch runs the routine ICD1864A, which 
  loads the DRG data. In the end of the process the ^ICDLOAD global is 
  killed programmatically.
  
  
  PLEASE NOTE: During the installation there are various ICD Codes required
  to be in the DRG load file that were removed from the Lexicon globals.
  These codes will cause the following messages to appear:
  
  Starting File #80 JUL 31, 2014@12:15:39
  
  ICD Code: H40.141 not in file #80
  
  ....
  
  These are not error messages, but rather audit messages showing that 
  expired codes are not in the Lexicon and can be ignored.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
  
  1a) This patch requires installation of the following data file:  
  ICD_18_64.GBL which contains the ^ICDLOAD global.
  
  1b) The following globals must be backed up during initial installation 
  of this patch and as well as every time it has to be re-installed after 
  the following patches: ICD*18.0*57 and LEX*2.0*80.    
           ICD DIAGNOSIS File (#80)               ^ICD9
           ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE File (#80.1)   ^ICD0
           DRG File (#80.2)                       ^ICD
  NOTE:  
  Please refer to Sections 2-6 for instructions on retrieving the file, 
  backing up the existing files and installing the new file.
  
  1c) It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak 
  hours to minimize potential disruption to users as extensive changes
  are made to existing files ICD DIAGNOSIS File (#80), 
  ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE File (#80.1) and DRG File (#80.2).
  
  1d) All steps leading up to the KIDS Installation may be done with 
  the users on the system. Administrative Users Only must be off of 
  the system during the KIDS installation. Applications, particularly
  Admission Discharge Transfer (ADT), Integrated Billing (IB) and
  Diagnosis Related Grouper (DRG), could encounter significant errors
  if exercised during the install.
  
  1e) Installation of ICD*18*64 should NOT be performed at the time frame
  when IB MT NIGHT COMP is running. Since installation of ICD*18*64 can
  take from 1 to 5 hours it is recommended to run it before the IB MT NIGHT
  COMP job:
  - Make all preparations ahead - perform steps 3, 5 and 6 of the 
    Pre-Installation Instructions. This might take 2 hours and can be done
    during normal working hours,
  - Determine the time when IB nightly job is scheduled to run in the  
    system,
  - Count 5 hours back from this time to determine the time when 
    ICD*18*64 installation can be started. 
  
  1f) Do not Interrupt the Installation - If the pre-install runs and 
  deletes the ICD files and the post-install does not run, the site may
  be left with either missing or incomplete ICD files.
  
  1g) Do not Queue this Installation -This installation is interactive.
  If it is queued, it will hang and not install.
  
  1h) Do not install if Windows Updates are Scheduled/Pending - Check
  with local network support that no Windows updates are scheduled for
  the period of the ICD-10 install. Also, check the toolbar and see if
  there is a Windows Update icon for a pending Windows update from a
  previous push. A Windows update will disrupt the session and the 
  KIDS installation.
  
  1i) The average install time for this patch is approximately 1-5 
  hours based on each site's mirror and production environment
  configuration, number of users on the system and background processes
  running at the time of the installation.
  
  2) Global backup and installation timing:
  
          Backup
          --------------
          ICD DIAGNOSIS     ^ICD9    214 MB    10 to    25 minutes
          ICD PROCEDURE     ^ICD0    129 MB     6 to    15 minutes
          DRG               ^ICD     2.8 MB     1 to     5 minutes
          Total Backup             345.8 MB    17 to    45 minutes
             
          Data Host File
          --------------
          FTP          ICD_18_64.GBL       69 GB    4 to  10 minutes
          Global Restore ^%GI ^ICDLOAD     20 MB    4 to  10 minutes
          Total Data                       89 MB    8 to  20 minutes
             
  3) Create a backup of the following global files before continuing:
          ICD DIAGNOSIS File (#80)               ^ICD9
          ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE File (#80.1)   ^ICD0
          DRG File (#80.2)                       ^ICD
             
  Make sure space is available before proceeding. It should take from 17 to
  45 minutes to create the backup files.
           
  When you are creating a backup of non-subscripted globals, you are
  saving the entire global. You should use the utility ^%GO for
  non-subscripted globals, and when prompted for a global, enter the global
  root (global name only, no open parenthesis, no file number and no
  commas, as shown below). If you are working in an environment where %GO
  will not run (usually due to sharing of globals between environments) 
  please use %GOGEN.
   
     Example with %GO:
   
          >D ^%GO
   
          Global output
          Device: xxxxxx:[yyyyyy]ICD9.GBL  
              where xxxxxx and yyyyyy specify your home folder
              for example: USER2$:[USERNAME]
          Parameters? "WNS" => (Skip)
          Description (^ for self-loading): 
   
          All Globals? No => No
          Global ^ICD9
          Global ^ (Skip)
          1 global selected from 638 available globals.
                          ICD9
          1 global written
   
     Example with %GOGEN:
          >D ^%GOGEN
           Device: xxxxxx:[yyyyyy]ICD9.GEN
              where xxxxxx and yyyyyy specify your home folder
              for example: USER2$:[USERNAME]
           Parameters? "WNS" => (Skip) 
           Warning:  Use a "V" format to avoid problems with control
           characters.
           Global ^ICD9 -- NOTE: translation in effect
           Global ^ (Skip)

  4) Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
  
  5) Transfer the ICD_18_64.GBL file from the FTP server to your 
     folder in the environment in which you are installing.
  
  6) Install the data from the global host file ICD_18_64.GBL.  
     This file contains the import global ^ICDLOAD.
   
     This global is approximately 20 megabytes in size. Make sure
     there is sufficient space available to load this global. The 
     loading of the global should take from 8 to 20 minutes.
   
     From the Programmer prompt, execute the following routine:
       >D ^%GI
  
       Global input
