    ICD APIs
    --------
   
      ICDEXLK                  Special Lookup for files 80 and 80.1
   
        Application specific code (QUASAR, DIE, Lab and Scheduling) has been 
        removed and replace with generic code for all applications.  A prompt
        was added for user confirmation when only one entry is found.  
        Up-arrow "^" processing has been modified, a single up-arrow will 
        return to the user input prompt (CR1395).  Moved processing of 
        up-arrow (DUOUT, DIRUT and DIROUT), timeouts (DTOUT) into the ICD* 
        namespace to prevent collisions with FileMan.  Fixed the display when
        DIC(0) contains "S" (suppress the .01 field).  Add prompt for IEN 
        lookup when DIC(0) contains A or E (SQA finding).
   
      $$ICDDATA^ICDXCODE       Data Retrieval for 2 file solution
   
        This API has been modified to return data on local VA codes (CR 1398).
        VA local codes cannot be used after Oct 1, 1991; however there still 
        remains a requirement to display them.
          
        NOTE:  The API $$ICDDATA^ICDXCODE was part of the two file solution 
        for ICD-10, where ICD-9 remained in files 80 and 80.1 and ICD-10 was
        stored in a new and separate file.  This design was replaced by the
        one file solution where ICD-10 is stored in the same files and ICD-9
        and uses the API $$ICDDX^ICDEX instead.  The API $$ICDDATA^ICDXCODE
        will be retired Apr 1, 2017 (18 months after the ICD-10 compliance
        date).
   
      $$ICDDX^ICDEX            Data Retrieval for 1 file solution
   
        This API has been modified to return data on local VA codes (CR 1398).
        VA local codes cannot be used after Oct 1, 1991; however there still 
        remains a requirement to display them.  (replaces $$ICDDATA^ICDXCODE)
   
      $$ICDOP^ICDEX            Data Retrieval for 1 file solution
   
        This API has been modified to return data on local VA codes (CR 1398).
        VA local codes cannot be used after Oct 1, 1991; however there still 
        remains a requirement to display them.  (replaces $$ICDDATA^ICDXCODE)
   
      $$RDX^ICDEX              New API to resolve ICD Diagnosis Code Fragment
   
        This API takes a partial code (without decimal) and converts it
        to an ICD Diagnosis code. (used internally)  Examples:
   
          Code Fragment   Effective Date   Resolved to   Coding System
          -------------   --------------   -----------   -----------
          311                              311.           1  ICD-9-CM
          A870                             A87.0         30  ICD-10-CM
          E8310             06/26/2014     E831.0         1  ICD-9-CM
          E8310             12/12/2015     E83.10        30  ICD-10-CM
   
      $$POAE^ICDEX             New API - Present on Admission Exempt
   
        This API returns a 1 if an ICD Diagnosis code is exempt from 
        Present on Admission (POA) reporting.  POA is an indicator of 
        the relationship between a diagnosis and inpatient admission, and
        can include:
   
           A diagnosis was present at time of inpatient admission
           A diagnosis was not present at time of inpatient admission
           The documentation was insufficient to determine if condition was 
               present at the time of inpatient admission
           The provider was unable to clinically determine whether the 
               condition was present at the time of inpatient admission
  
      $$HAC^ICDEX              New API - Hospital Acquired Conditions
   
        This API returns a 1 if a diagnosis can be acquired during
        an inpatient visit.  It is used in conjunction with present on
        admission (POA) to calculate a DRG group.
