     Problem:
     ========
     ICD-10 patch ICD*18.0*64 included a .GBL file that contained data 
     to be loaded into several VistA files.  If the .GBL file was not
     properly loaded in the system before the Kernel Installation & 
     Distribution System (KIDS) build was installed, it is possible
     that these files were not updated properly and entries may have
     been deleted. These missing entries will affect the use of ICD-10
     codes starting October 1, 2015.
     
     Solution:
     =========
     Verify files DRG SURGICAL HIERARCHY (#80.5), DRG HAC (#80.6), DRG 
     DIAGNOSIS IDENTIFIER CODES (#82), DRG PROCEDURE IDENTIFIER CODES
     (#82.1), DRG PROCEDURE CODE COMBINATIONS (#82.11), DRG DIAGNOSIS
     CODE COMBINATIONS (#82.12) and DRG CC EXCLUSIONS (#82.13) were
     loaded properly in VistA TEST and PRODUCTION accounts.
     
  
  
 How to check if the ICD*18.0*64 installation was not installed properly:
 ========================================================================
 Information Resource Management (IRM) should perform an ^%G lookup
 on several files. The following instructions will show the zero node
 of the files, and the third piece of the node contains the total
 number of entries in that file. The count should match the entries
 listed in the table below under the "Expected # of entries" column. 
 If your count matches the "Actual # of entries" column, you have a
 potential issue and should log a Remedy ticket as soon as possible so
 the problem can be corrected. Please tell the National Service Desk to
 mark the ticket as 'HIGH' priority.
  
  
  From the programmer prompt enter the following:
  
  D ^%G <return>
  
  Device: <return>
  Right margin: 80 => <return>
  Screen size for paging (0=nopaging)? 24 => <return>
  For help on global specifications DO HELP^%G
