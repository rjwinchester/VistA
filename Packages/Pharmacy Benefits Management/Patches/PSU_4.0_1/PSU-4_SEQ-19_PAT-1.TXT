Subject: Pharmacy Patient IV Calculations

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 This patch addresses the following problem:
   
  
 The pharmacy patient IV report of the Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) 
 extract does not calculate values for returned, destroyed, or canceled IV 
 orders. This is because the inpatient option Returns and Destroyed Entry 
 (IV) (PSJI RETURNS) does not place a value for the DAILY USAGE field (#6)
 of the PHARMACY PATIENT File (#55.1111) that the PBM software is checking
 in order to add the total number of returned, destroyed or canceled IVs.

 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 INC000001244256 - PBMAMIS report does not show the amount RETURNED, 
                   DESTROYED, OR CANCELLED
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The pharmacy patient IV report of the Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) 
 extract does not calculate values for returned, destroyed, or canceled IV 
 orders. This is because the inpatient option Returns and Destroyed Entry 
 (IV) (PSJI RETURNS) does not place a value for the DAILY USAGE field (#6)
 of the PHARMACY PATIENT FILE (#55.1111) that the PBM software is checking
 in order to add the total number of returned, destroyed or canceled IVs.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------  
 Since the inpatient software does not construct the DAILY USAGE field (#6)
 as part of the node for the IV label the PBM software will no longer check
 for it for returned, destroyed or canceled IVs.
  
 Technical:
 ----------
 The routine PSUV1 has been modified to count IVs in the pharmacy patient
 IV report regardless of whether or not the DAILY USAGE field (#6) has a
 value.
