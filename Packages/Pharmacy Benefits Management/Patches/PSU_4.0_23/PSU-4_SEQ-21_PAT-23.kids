Problem: 
"BLD",10754,1,12,0)
--------
"BLD",10754,1,13,0)
The CMOP-Nat VistA system migrated to the Region 1 Denver Data Center on 
"BLD",10754,1,14,0)
July 29, 2017. During the migration a problem was identified with the HL 
"BLD",10754,1,15,0)
Logical Link "PSU SEND". It was discovered that the HL Logical Link entry 
"BLD",10754,1,16,0)
on all VAMC VistA systems was set with an invalid DNS DOMAIN of 
"BLD",10754,1,17,0)
"CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT". The Region 1 Denver Data Center migration team along
"BLD",10754,1,18,0)
with the National VistA Migration Team requested that a national software 
"BLD",10754,1,19,0)
patch be created and released to update the "PSU SEND" entry in the HL 
"BLD",10754,1,20,0)
Logical Link file to use the correct DNS DOMAIN "HL7.CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT". 
"BLD",10754,1,21,0)
This change is required so that when there are hardware changes to the 
"BLD",10754,1,22,0)
CMOP-Nat VistA system, VistA HL7's DNS-aware functionality will automatically
"BLD",10754,1,23,0)
update the link's IP address without requiring individual, manual updates at
"BLD",10754,1,24,0)
each site. During the migration as a work-around, "CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT" and
"BLD",10754,1,25,0)
its associated IP were broadcasted nationally so there would be no disruption
"BLD",10754,1,26,0)
to message traffic being sent by the VAMCs, but "HL7.CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT" is
"BLD",10754,1,27,0)
the preferred and best long-term solution. The PSU SEND logical link was 
"BLD",10754,1,28,0)
created during the pre-install steps of PSU*4*3 (PBM EXTRACT ENHANCEMENT
"BLD",10754,1,29,0)
III).
"BLD",10754,1,30,0)
 
"BLD",10754,1,31,0)
Resolution:
"BLD",10754,1,32,0)
-----------
"BLD",10754,1,33,0)
A post-install routine (PSO23PI) will be executed following the installation
"BLD",10754,1,34,0)
of this patch and will perform the following update if necessary:
"BLD",10754,1,35,0)
 
"BLD",10754,1,36,0)
 1. Loop through all the records in the HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870) and
"BLD",10754,1,37,0)
    retrieve the value for the  DNS DOMAIN field (#.08)
"BLD",10754,1,38,0)
 2. If the DNS DOMAIN value (converted to uppercase) is different than
"BLD",10754,1,39,0)
    "CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT", skip the record (no update)
"BLD",10754,1,40,0)
 3. If the DNS DOMAIN uppercase value is equal to "CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT", 
"BLD",10754,1,41,0)
    update it to "HL7.CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT"
"BLD",10754,1,42,0)
 
"BLD",10754,1,43,0)
Once the patch PSU*4*23 successfully installs a Mailman message will be sent
"BLD",10754,1,44,0)
to the PSU MAIL group and the person who installed the patch with the 
"BLD",10754,1,45,0)
