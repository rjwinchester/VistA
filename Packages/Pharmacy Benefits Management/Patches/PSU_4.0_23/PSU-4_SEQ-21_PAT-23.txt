Subject: UPDATE HL LOGICAL LINK WITH CORRECT DNS DOMAIN

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue:
  
 1. I16082026FY17 - PSU SEND has incorrect DNS DOMAIN
  
   
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. I16082026FY17 - PSU SEND has incorrect DNS DOMAIN
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 The CMOP-Nat VistA system migrated to the Region 1 Denver Data Center on 
 July 29, 2017. During the migration a problem was identified with the HL 
 Logical Link "PSU SEND". It was discovered that the HL Logical Link entry 
 on all VAMC VistA systems was set with an invalid DNS DOMAIN of 
 "CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT". The Region 1 Denver Data Center migration team along
 with the National VistA Migration Team requested that a national software 
 patch be created and released to update the "PSU SEND" entry in the HL 
 Logical Link file to use the correct DNS DOMAIN "HL7.CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT". 
 This change is required so that when there are hardware changes to the 
 CMOP-Nat VistA system, VistA HL7's DNS-aware functionality will automatically
 update the link's IP address without requiring individual, manual updates at
 each site. During the migration as a work-around, "CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT" and
 its associated IP were broadcasted nationally so there would be no disruption
 to message traffic being sent by the VAMCs, but "HL7.CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT" is
 the preferred and best long-term solution. The PSU SEND logical link was 
 created during the pre-install steps of PSU*4*3 (PBM EXTRACT ENHANCEMENT
 III).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A post-install routine (PSO23PI) will be executed following the installation
 of this patch and will perform the following update if necessary:
  
  1. Loop through all the records in the HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870) and
     retrieve the value for the  DNS DOMAIN field (#.08)
  2. If the DNS DOMAIN value (converted to uppercase) is different than
     "CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT", skip the record (no update)
  3. If the DNS DOMAIN uppercase value is equal to "CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT", 
     update it to "HL7.CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT"
  
 Once the patch PSU*4*23 successfully installs a Mailman message will be sent
 to the PSU MAIL group and the person who installed the patch with the 
 following information:
  
   Subj: PSU*4*23 DNS DOMAIN CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT Update  [#2737116]
   From: POSTMASTER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The post-install routine performed the following updates:
  
   HL LOGICAL LINK       DNS DOMAIN (Before Patch)   DNS DOMAIN (After Patch)
   --------------------- -------------------------   ------------------------
   PSU SEND              CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT         HL7.CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT
  
   Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore//  
  
 In case the post-install routine does not find any entries in the HL LOGICAL 
 LINK file that needs to be updated it will instead send this message:
   
    Subj: PSU*4*23 DNS DOMAIN CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT Update  [#2737114] 
    From: POSTMASTER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The post-install routine found no records in the HL LOGICAL LINK file 
    (#870) with the DNS DOMAIN field (#.08) set to 'CMOP-NAT.DOMAIN.EXT'.
    No updates performed.
  
    Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore// 
  
 Note: Non-production accounts usually have the DNS DOMAIN field (#.08) in
       HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870) set to null/blank and for this reason this
       patch will make no update in most of these accounts.

 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the patch
 number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
 4.0;PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT;**[PATCH LIST]**;MARCH, 2005
    
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run to
 compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch description.
   
   
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Since this patch only contains a post-install routine there is absolutely no
 components that would need to be rolled back.
