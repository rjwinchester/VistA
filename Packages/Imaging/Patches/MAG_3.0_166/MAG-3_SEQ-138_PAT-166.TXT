 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
 1.      Defect 292015 (Trouble Ticket I14509823FY17, R14507071FY17, 
 R14511179FY17, R15488066FY17, I15621144FY17, I15440327FY17)  $ZUTIL 
 Replacement Functions
  
 Problem:  The DICOM Gateways use InterSystems Cachi $ZUTIL calls for 
 interfacing with the Windows operating systems and Cachi internals.  We 
 have been advised by InterSystems that the $ZUTIL calls are being 
 deprecated and that we need to switch over to Cachi class methods.
  
 The calls are isolated in four operating systems interface routines on 
 the DICOM Gateway:
  
 1.    MAGOSDIR - handles directory functions
 2.    MAGOSFIL - handles file access methods
 3.    MAGOSMSC - provides miscellaneous functions
 4.    MAGOSTCP - supports Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) capabilities
  
 Additionally, after the install of MAG*3.0*176, some sites saw an 
 increase in the error message Error: <VALUE OUT OF
 RANGE>CCHWILD+4^MAGOSDIR "<ZVALUE OUT OF RANGE-unknown>" at 
 CCHWILD+4^MAGOSDIR MUMPS Code: " S 
 TIME=$TR($ZDATETIME($ZU(140,2,NAME),8,1)," :",".")-17000000"
  
 Resolution:   Deprecated $ZU utilities functions were replaced with Cache'
 method calls and the $$DEL functions were removed from the HOSTCMD 
 subroutine in MAGOSMSC.  The explicit delete functions were causing
 "Access Denied" errors at a site that had switched to SSH.
  
 2.      Defect 292022  Multi-word Passwords
 Problem:  Users were unable to run the Legacy DICOM Gateway during 
 testing.  Further investigation showed it was due to a space in the IA 
 (Integration Agreement) account.
  
 Resolution:  The code was modified to allow a space in the password.
  
 3.      Defect 370873 (Trouble Tickets R10291624FY16 & R11277667FY17) 
 JPEG Compression
 Problem:  Sites were reporting routing compression no longer worked and 
 they were receiving the error "JPEG 2000 Compression not licensed on this 
 system."  It was discovered that this was due to a check for the file 
 "awj2k.dll" in the wrong directory.   After the upgrade to OS 2012/2008 
 the "\Program Files\VistA\" directory is replaced with "\Program files 
 (x86)\Vista\", but Windows directories "\Program Files\VistA\" is hard 
 coded in multiple ^MAG routines.
  
 Resolution:  The hardcoded path was modified to point to the correct file 
 location.
  
 4.      Defect 194666 (Trouble Ticket R6303222FY16/Ticket 1009542) Stop 
 Daily Report Message
 Problem:  Each of the approximately 700 VistA Imaging DICOM gateways 
 transmits a Daily Report message to a system in which the data was 
 compiled for use by the VistA Imaging (Food and Drug Administration) FDA 
 consultant during development.  As these reports are no longer needed for 
 sustainment, and multiple system database crashes have occurred due to 
 the large amount of data continually compiled for these reports, the 
 transmissions of these reports needs to be stopped.
  
 Resolution:  Code for the daily report message was removed.
  
 5.      Defect 194693 (Ticket 1280785) HDIG Generates Improper Increment 
 Entries in MAGDINPT
 Problem:  The HDIG is somehow generating improper increments in the 
 legacy DICOM Gateway.  When this occurs, that means the legacy 2-3 
 process shuts down.  Global 2006.571 was being locked at the wrong time.
  
 Resolution:  This global lock was moved to prevent issues with inaccurate 
 incrementing.
  
 6.      Defect 198336 (Ticket 1280785) RPC "MAGV FIND STUDY TIU" Not 
 Registered to the Option "MAG DICOM VISA"
 Problem:  A previous installation of VistA Imaging included the MAGV FIND 
 STUDY TIU Remote Procedure Call (RPC), but failed to add the RPC to the 
 MAG DICOM VISA VistA menu.
  
 Resolution:  MAGV FIND STUDY TIU has been registered to the MAG DICOM 
 VISA option.
  
 7.      Defect 376171 (Tickets I10241107FY16, I10195009FY16, 
 10385359FY16, R10388245FY16, I10427768FY16) 174 Changes
 Problem:  There were several issues addressed in emergency Patch 174, but 
 this code also needs to be in this Gateway patch (MAG*3.0*166) since it 
 was started first.
  
 Resolution:  All modified code for Patch 174 has been included in this 
 patch (MAG*3.0*166).
  
 8.       Defect 194602 Add "LAB_MEDIA" to the M Code
 Problem:  When updating the instrument.dic file, there is M code that 
 checks for RAD_MEDIA and CON_MEDIA.  However, Patch 138 added LAB orders, 
 as well, but it appears the M code check did not get updated with 
 LAB_MEDIA.  This needs to be addressed.
  
 Resolution:  The MAGDMFBI routine was modified on the DICOM Gateway that 
 processes the INSTRUMENT.DIC file to require that RAD_MEDIA, CON_MEDIA, 
 and LAB_MEDIA be in the file.
  
 IMPORTER III was modified to specifically look for RAD_MEDIA, CON_MEDIA, 
 or LAB_MEDIA, based on Imaging Service (RAD, CON, or LAB).  It will then 
 pass that value to the HDIG and that value will be passed onto the 
 Gateway and recorded in statistics.  
  
 A LAB service is required in INSTRUMENT.DIC.  The following:is required:
 # Place your entries below
 RAD_MEDIA|Radiology Media Importer||RAD|65000|VHAxxxDIG1
 CON_MEDIA|Consult Media Importer||CON|65001|VHAxxxDIG1
 LAB_MEDIA|Lab Media Importer||LAB|65002|VHAxxxDIG1
  
 9.      Defect 372434 (Trouble Ticket #s: R11995929FY17, I10849673FY16 
 -   INC000001231626) Wrong Date of Birth (DOB)
 Problem:  Site reported that the wrong DOB for a patient was sent to a 
 modality and displayed in the worklist.  After researching the issue, 
 Clin 3 was able to substantiate their claim; the patient's correct DOB 
 could be found in the VistA Patient (#2) file, but an incorrect DOB was 
 present in the Modality Worklist (MWL) data.  This was not a one-time 
 occurrence; the patient had several exams over multiple days and each of 
 the MWL entries contained an incorrect DOB.  Upon further review, we
 found the issue has occurred for multiple patients.
  
 It was discovered that the Data File Number (DFN) value was actually
 changed during the registration of the patient's exam in the Radiology 
 package.  The code is actually setting the DFN to a different (incorrect) 
 patient because it is referencing the wrong location in the array.  The 
 change in the DFN value only occurs when the database contains a different
 patient with a DFN that matches the original patient's Social Security
 Number (SSN).
  
 Resolution:  The code was revised to modify a routine and the DFN was 
 pulled from the correct array location.
  
 10.      Defect 409999 (Trouble Ticket #s I10737760FY16, I14808934FY17) 
 Sites Getting Unsent/Pending HL7 Message in the HLO Queue
 Problem:  Sites were getting an unsent/pending HL7 message in the HL7 
 Optimized (HLO) Queue.  VistA Imaging is creating HL7 messages to send to 
 MAG DPS (digital pathology system), but the Digital Pathology System is 
 not hooked up at this point in time.  This is causing the message to
 remain in the HLO Queue.
  
 Resolution:  A switch parameter was added to the Site Parameters FileMan 
 file on the VistA system that will toggle whether or not HLO messages are 
 sent.
  
 11.      Defect 414807 (Trouble Ticket # I10953108FY17)  DICOM Gateway 
 Running out of Space
 Problem:  A site reported that their DICOM gateway kept running out of 
 disk space.  The C:\DICOM\CACHE directory was growing up to 40-50 GB 
 before the drive filled up.  The gateway had been very busy processing 
 images but that was still unusual for the Cache' directory to grow that 
 large.
  
 In the release of Cache' 2010 in MAG*3.0*162, the journaling function 
 changed and now can take up more space on the hard drive.
  
 Resolution:  Setting the DICOM database item, Global Journal State, 
 option to "No" corrects the excessive disk space usage and an added 
 benefit is that the image processing speed increased significantly.  If 
 sites are experiencing this problem, it is recommended that they turn the 
 journaling off.  From the Cache' System Management Portal Home, select 
 the System Configuration tab and then Local Databases -> DICOM.  Set the 
 Global Journal State checkbox to "No" and then click the Save button.  
 The DICOM Installation Guide was also updated with this information.
  
 12.      Defect 461667  (Trouble Ticket # R12662221FY17, R12658160FY17, 
 R12635569FY17, I12623351FY17, I12618217FY17) Evaluator Will Not Run after 
 FM 22.2 Installation
 Problem:  The routing evaluator error "Remote process has ended: 
 -3,Inactive: Interrupted" is being generated at sites that have updated 
 to FileMan v22.2; specifically, the errors are as a result of a change in 
 the output variables of the FileMan call DT^DICRW in Version 22.2.  This 
 call is utilized in VistA Imaging routine MAGBRTE3 to set required 
 variables for routing, but the MAG routine was affected by the new updates
 to DT^DICRW introduced in FileMan v22.2.
  
 Resolution:  The VistA routine MAGBRTE3 has been updated to handle the 
 DT^DICRW updates in FileMan v22.2.
  
 13.     Defect 490401 (Trouble Ticket # s R11004539FY17 and 
 I12492219FY17) Importer/HDIG Sending Wrong Item
 Problem:  The Importer client is sending over the Station Number for RPC 
 "MAGV RAD STAT COMPLETE" but the VistA code requires the Institution 
 Internal Entry Number (IEN).
  
 Resolution:  The Station Number was converted to an IEN utilizing the 
 supported IA# 2171.
  
 14.     Defect 526930(Trouble Ticket # R13978077FY17) Update the 
 BATCH_SEND_IMAGE.bat that is installed with the LDGW
 Problem:  Clin 3 provided a new batch file for sending images used by the 
 sites.  This file is installed with the LDGW but has been updated and
 they would like the update to be included in the install.  This new file 
 is called dcf_BATCH_SEND_IMAGE.bat.  Instead of replacing what is there, 
 we are installing this file along with the other and the users have a
 choice on which to use.
  
 Resolution:  The code for DICOM_Silent_Install_2011.ism was modified to 
 include the DCF_BATCH_SEND_IMAGE.bat file
