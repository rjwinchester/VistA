Subj: PATCH MAG*3*166 UPDATE - IMPORTANT  [#2600781]
10 Oct 2017 10:26:43 -0400 (EDT)  179 lines
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** IMPORTANT **
===============
A Health Level 7 (HL7) version compatibility issue was discovered in MAG*3.0*
166 that may cause the wrong Date of Birth (DOB) to be displayed in the 
Modality Worklist (MWL) for a patient. If a site is running an incompatible 
version of HL7, the old version of the MAG7RS routine backed up during the 
install of MAG*3.0*166 should be loaded immediately after the install of MAG*
3.0*166.

Note: It is not advisable to upgrade the version of HL7 because of this issue. 
This solution is a temporary fix until MAG*3.0*183 is released. MAG7RS.RTN 
will be eliminated in that patch. 


PLEASE FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW - 
-----------------------------
1.  Run FileMan Print from #101 Protocol file (steps shown below).
2.  Review FileMan output to determine if site is running an incompatible 
version of HL7 (output examples shown below).
3.  If site is presently at HL7 v2.4 NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUIRED.
4.  AFTER THE INSTALLATION OF MAG*3.0*166, if site HL7 version is presently 2.
1 or 2.3, install MAG*3.0*166 MAG7RS routine BACKUP (steps shown below).   
Note - If MAG7RS routine was not backed up during installation of MAG*3.0*166 
please enter a ticket for assistance by contacting the National Service Desk 
at 1-855-673-4357.
5.  Confirm Checksum version of MAG7RS routine (steps shown below).

#4 - INSTALL MAG7RS BACKUP
==========================
Administrators will need to use the PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE. 
Check your MailMan messages for the backup message sent by the 'Backup a 
Transport Global' function.
       1. Select the message shown below:
               Backup of MAG*3.0*166 install on <mmm dd, yyyy> <user name>
       2. Select the Xtract PackMan option.
       3. Select the Install/Check Message option.
       4. Enter 'Yes' at the prompt.
       5. Enter 'Yes' at the backup prompt.

 Example - 
  Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore// Xtract PackMan
       Select PackMan function: ?
               Answer with PackMan function NUMBER, or NAME
       Choose from:
               1 ROUTINE LOAD
               2 GLOBAL LOAD
               3 PACKAGE LOAD
               4 SUMMARIZE MESSAGE
               5 PRINT MESSAGE
               6 INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE

               8 TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY
               9 COMPARE MESSAGE
       Select PackMan function: Select PackMan function: 7 INSTALL SELECTED 
ROUTINE(S)

Warning:  Installing this message will cause a permanent update of globals 
and routines.
  Do you really want to do this? NO// y  YES
  ROUTINE(S): MAG7RS                           <<<----------------
  ROUTINE(S): <return>

Routines are the only parts that are backed up.  NO other parts
are backed up, not even globals.  You may use the 'Summarize Message'
option of PackMan to see what parts the message contains.
Those parts that are not routines should be backed up separately
if they need to be preserved.


Shall I preserve the routines on disk in a separate back-up message? YES// <
return>

#5 - VERIFY MAG7RS BACKUP INSTALL -   MAG7RS    value = 54519012
=================================
>D CHECK1^XTSUMBLD

New CheckSum CHECK1^XTSUMBLD:

This option determines the current checksum of selected routine(s).
The Checksum of the routine is determined as follows:

1. Any comment line with a single semi-colon is presumed to be
   followed by comments and only the line tag will be included.

2. Line 2 will be excluded from the count.

3. The total value of the routine is determined (excluding
   exceptions noted above) by multiplying the ASCII value of each
   character by its position on the line and position of the line in 
   the routine being checked.

     Select one of the following:

          P         Package
          B         Build

Build from: P  Package


All Routines? No => No

Routine: MAG7RS
Routine: <return>
1 routine

MAG7RS    value = 54519012
done
