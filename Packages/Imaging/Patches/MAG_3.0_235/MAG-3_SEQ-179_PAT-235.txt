 Defect Tracking System Tickets
 ==============================
 1.  Defect 874718 (Trouble Ticket # INC2148553, INC3113629, INC0031259)
     "FATAL: Failed to connect:  The user name or password is incorrect"
     error in the BP Import Queue
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 Sites reported errors in the BP Import Queue, "FATAL: Failed to connect:  
 The user name or password is incorrect."  The failures are all Rescinded 
 Image entries that follow an import that has its own user name and 
 password.  The user name and password are not getting cleared prior to 
 the processing of the Rescinded Image entry causing a network access
 error.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========  
 Code was modified to clear the user name and password variables before 
 processing a Rescinded Image Import entry.
  
 2.  Defect 874727 (Trouble Ticket # INC3528956, INC3176909) "No entry 
     established for the image file <server name>" error in BP Delete Queue
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 Sites reported errors in the BP Delete Queue, "No entry established for 
 the image file <server name>."  The failures all occur from the entries 
 added to the Delete Queue after watermarking a Rescinded Image.  The 
 original image and its text file and abstract are deleted after the new 
 watermarked image is created. The deletion of the text file is failing.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========  
 The issue is with an incorrect path for the TXT file deletion in the
 Delete Queue. The code keys in on the "." character and replaces the file 
 extension.  This works fine for a standard path on the local drive, but 
 the code fails when an IP address/FQDN is in the patch because they 
 include periods. The code was modified to account for the IP address/FQDN 
 in the path.
  
 3.  Defect 904225 (Trouble Ticket # INC3731743) Network share reverting
     back to old entry after clicking Properties button
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 In the BP, the Network Share field for Tier 1 and Tier 2 is not holding 
 its change when the user selects the Properties button to verify the 
 location entered. The user must move the cursor into another field and 
 select the apply button, then select the Properties button for the value 
 to not revert back to what was entered.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========  
 Modified the code so that the value stays in the Network Share field after
 the properties button is selected and after the properties window is
 closed. The user can then decide to accept the new value or cancel the 
 action.
  
 4.  Defect 856424 Access/Verify Code error message displays behind VistA
 Sign-on window.
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 When a user enters invalid Access/Verify Codes while logging into VistA, 
 the system gives an error message.  The Error message is hidden under the 
 main Vista Sign-on window. The user must move the VistA Sign-on window, 
 then click 'OK' in the Error message window to be able to continue.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========  
 Modified the code so that the error displays in front of the VistA Sign-on
 window until the User selects OK.
  
 5.  Defect 989032 (Trouble Ticket# INC5301306) Imaging Site Parameter 
 window displays error when accessed.
  
 Problem:
 ======== 
 When opening the Imaging Site Parameters window from the Edit ->Imaging 
 Site Parameters menu option, user is receiving the error "invalid pointer 
 operation" and are not able to access the window.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========  
 Modified Mumps post install routine to contain code to register two RPCs 
 that were new for MAG*3.0*222 (MAGQBP SETVAL and MAGQBP GETVAL).
  
  
 6.  Defect 989050 Imaging Site Parameters tab does not display default
 user preference.
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 When selecting Edit -> Purge/Verify/RG Setting and then selecting the 
 Imaging Site Parameters tab, no default user preference is displayed 
 despite being set.  If Default User Preference is selected in the drop 
 down box, an error, "List Index out of bounds (0)" is generated.
  
 Resolution:  
 ===========
 Code has been modified to provide the same results as if the user accessed
 the Imaging Site Parameters window directly from the Edit menu.
