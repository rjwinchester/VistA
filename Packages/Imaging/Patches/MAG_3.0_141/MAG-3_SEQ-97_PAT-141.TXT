Subject: HL7 VERSION 2.4 CORRECTIONS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Radiology HL7 Version 2.4 interface was released in August 2011 as 
 two patches: RA*5.0*47 and MAG*3.0*49.  The Radiology Patch RA*5.0*47  
 deals with the generation of the radiology-specific HL7 segments: ORC, 
 OBR, and OBX.  The Imaging Patch MAG*3.0*49 handles the patient-specific 
 HL7 segments: PID, PV1.
  
 Three problems were found in Imaging Patch MAG*3.0*49:
  
 1) A long PID segment (greater than 255 characters) was not handled
 properly.  (This was a very rare occurrence.)  An HL7 message's Patient 
 Identification (PID) segment can exceed 255 characters in certain 
 situations and must be handled without error. The original MAG*3.0*49 code
 (released August 2011) could not handle this.
  
 2) The patient's telephone number was not included in the PID segment.  
 It should have been present in PID-13 Phone Number - Home.  This was to
 have been included and is an error of omission.
  
 3) The outpatient location was not present.  (Only the inpatient location
 was included).  This was a design error based on IHE Radiology Technical
 Framework, Vol 2, 2/18/2011,  paragraph 4.4.4.1.2.3,  which says that only
 the admitted inpatient  location is to be sent in PV1-3 Assigned Patient
 Location.  The outpatient location will now be included in PV1-11
 Temporary Location.
  
 This patch provides the following enhancements and changes.
   HL7 Enhancements
 1) Upgraded the code to handle PID segments that exceed 255 characters.
 2) Provide the patient's telephone number in the PID-13 Phone Number - 
 Home field.
 3) Provide the outpatient location in the PV1-11 Temporary Location field.

 Installation
 ============
 Installing the VistA system (KIDS) involves installing the MAG*3.0*141 
 KIDS file on the VistA system.
  
 Before installing this file, all released patches, including the patches 
 listed in Associated Patches, must be installed.
  
 Installing the KIDS Package
  
 To install the KIDS file:
 1. Access the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu [XPD MAIN]
  
 2. Run the Installation option [XPD INSTALLATION MENU].
  
 3. Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
  
    a. Run the Load a Distribution [XPD LOAD DISTRIBUTION] option to load
       the KIDS distribution.
  
    b. When prompted, enter the path and file name (MAG3_0P141.KID) of the
       MAG*3.0*141 KIDS file that you downloaded from the 
       [] directory.
  
    c. When prompted to continue with the load, enter YES. A Distribution
       OK! message displays when the load is complete.
  
 4. After you load the KIDS file, use the following options to verify the
    contents of the patch and to back up any affected routines.
  
    a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global [XPD PRINT CHECKSUM] - Run this
    option if you want to ensure the integrity of the routines in the
    patch.
  
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE TO SYSTEM] -
    Run this option if you want to view all changes that will be made when
    the patch is installed. All components (routines, options, and so on)
    in the patch will be compared.
  
    c. Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] - Run this option if you want
    to create a backup message of any routines exported with the patch. The
    option does NOT back up any of the other changes.
  
 5. After performing the load and any optional verification steps, install
 the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
  
    a. Run the Install Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option 
    b. When prompted for the install name, enter MAG*3.0*141 
    c. Answer NO to the following prompts:
