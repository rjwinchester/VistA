 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1.  Defect 504534  (Ticket #I13812648FY17) Jukebox Queue Error
 Problem:  
 There was an issue with the Jukebox queue where it would stop at about 
 100 and then would create thousands of VistA errors in the error trap.
  
 Resolution:  
 The code was changed for the MAGQUEUE node entry in the MAGQBTM routine 
 to prevent the issue of multiple BPs processing in the queue at the same
 time.
  
 2.  Defect 454048  (Ticket #R10845403FY16/INC000000976044) Entries in 
 Queue File not Removed
 Problem:  
 The D cross-reference doesn't always get deleted when the status changes 
 in the Queue file #2006.03.
  
 Resolution:  
 The code was added to clean up the "D" cross-reference of the Orphan 
 entries MAGQUEUE at the P186 KIDS pre-install stage.  Also, the de-queue
 section of the MAGQBUT2 (M) routine was modified to remove all
 cross-reference entries after the queue entry itself has been 
 deleted.
  
 3.  Defect 512732 (Ticket #R13143071FY17) BP Verifier on Auto Error
 Problem:  
 There is a problem with the BP Verifier process for consolidated sites.  
 For consolidated sites, when running on auto, the Verifier will end as
 soon as it finds an image that has already been verified (IQ field not
 blank), whether or not it is for the correct site (or one of its
 sub-sites).  If one site runs the Verifier, it checks the image; when
 another site runs the Verifier, it comes across images already verified
 and stops because the Verifier checks all images not by site.
  
 Resolution:  
 To avoid the consolidated sites having the same issue, where the (Auto) 
 Scheduled Verifier stops abnormally, the Verifier has now been coded to
 NOT quit right at the first verified entry.  It will continue to look for
 more images for the same site.
  
 Test Sites:
 ==========
 The following sites are test sites for this patch:
    VISN 2 Upstate New York Health Care System (Buffalo, Batavia, 
 Canandaigua, Syracuse, Bath, Albany)
     Cheyenne VA Medical Center
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 =================================================
 Software being released and/or documentation describing the new 
 functionality introduced by this patch are available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext. 
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may also
 elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server.
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at the following OI Field Offices:
  
 Hines:          domain.ext  
 Salt Lake City: domain.ext
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at: http://www4.domain.ext/vdl/.
  
 Patch Installation:
 ===================
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ===============================
 MAG*3.0*186 must be installed on the VistA System.  This patch must be 
 installed by the compliance date. This patch has a KIDS file only.
  
 All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of this 
 patch.  This patch can be loaded while the VistA Imaging System is active,
 but all Background Processor tasks should be stopped and closed, including
 the BP Verifier and Purge.  Installation for the KIDS will take less than
 15 minutes.  Some sites may have more than one BP server; please notify
 all VistA sites and schedule the KIDS updates to occur during non-peak
 hours.  Take care to install this patch well before the Scheduled Verifier
 start time, and while it is not currently running.   
 If the Scheduled (Auto) Verifier must be stopped, then the portion of
 images not verified should be manually verified later.  As long as
 the processes are stopped first, the best time might be during the day 
 when Applications staff can coordinate with Imaging support.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 =============================
 Verify that the patches listed in the Associated Patches section of this 
 document have been previously installed.  Any Background Processor task
 that is running (Queue Processor, Verifier, Purge) must be stopped
 (applications are closed) prior to the installation of the KIDS.  However,
 any image capture application (Clinical Capture and DICOM Gateway
 processing) can continue to operate.
  
 Note:  
 ====
 All released VistA Imaging patches must be installed on the VistA system 
 before installing MAG*3.0*186.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 ==============================
 Restart all Background Processor tasks that were stopped for installation.
  
 VistA System (KIDS) Installation Instructions
 =============================================
 Installation Steps 
 ==================
 1.   On the VistA system, access the Kernel Installation and Distribution 
 System Menu [XPD MAIN].
 2.   Run the Installation option [XPD INSTALLATION MENU].
 3.   Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
       a.  Run the Load a Distribution option [XPD LOAD DISTRIBUTION] to 
 load the KIDS distribution.
       b.  When prompted, enter the full path and file name
 (MAG3_0P186.KID) of the MAG*3.0*186 KIDS file.
       c.  When prompted to continue with the load, enter "YES". A 
 Distribution OK! message will be displayed when the load is complete.
 4.   After loading the KIDS file, use the following options to verify the 
 contents of the patch and to back up any affected routines.
      a.   Verify Checksums in Transport Global [XPD PRINT CHECKSUM] - Run 
 this option if you want to ensure the integrity of the routines in the
 patch. 
      b.   Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE TO 
 SYSTEM] - Run this option if you want to view all changes that will be
 made when the patch is installed.  All components (routines, options, and
 so on) in the patch will be compared.
      c.   Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] - Run this option if you 
 want to create a backup message of any routines exported with the patch.  
 It will NOT back up any of the other changes.
 5.  After performing the load and any optional verification steps, 
 install the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
      a. Run the Install Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option.
      b. When prompted for the install name, enter "MAG*3.0*186".
      c. Answer "NO" to the following prompts, if they appear:
  
  Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO//
  Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//
  Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO//
  
 6.   When installation is finished, an Install Complete message will be 
 displayed.
  
 KIDS Installation Example
 This example shows the output when the KIDS file is installed for the 
 first time.  If you have already installed the patch and are installing
 the KIDS file in a namespace on which it has previously been installed,
 your output may be different.
