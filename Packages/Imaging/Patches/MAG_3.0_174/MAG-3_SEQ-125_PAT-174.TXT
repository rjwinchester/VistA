 Description:
 ===========
 MAG*3.0*174 has an emergency fix for Veterans Health Information Systems 
 and Technology Architecture (VistA) Imaging's Modality Worklist (MWL).  
 There was an issue reported within the MWL in which patients with 
 completed exams were not falling off the worklists once the exams had 
 been completed and closed.  The Text Gateway MWL entries in question all 
 have a status of "Departed" and a consult status in VistA of "Complete."

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
 1. Defect 371594 (Tickets I10241107FY16,  I10195009FY16, R10385359FY16, 
 R10388245FY16, I10427768FY16 ) Post-162 Text Gateway - Completed Exams 
 not Clearing the Modality Worklist (MWL)
  
 Problem:
 =======  
 There was an issue reported within the modality worklist in which 
 patients with completed exams were not falling off the worklists once the 
 exams had been completed and closed.  The Text Gateway MWL entries in 
 question all have a status of "Departed" and a consult status in VistA of 
 "Complete."
  
 Previously, the Check Out appointment status was split into two different 
 statuses "SADM Cancelled" and "Departed."  Those appointments with the 
 canceled status continued to be removed from the study, but those with 
 the departed status just showed an updated status.  In an attempt to fix 
 these departed statuses, sites would go in after the study had been 
 worked and update the appointment status to "Checked Out/Departed."  This 
 caused studies to reappear on the worklists.
  
 Resolution:
 ==========
 Appointments will now be removed from the Modality Worklist once the 
 status is changed to "Departed."
  
 2. Defect 391065 (Tickets I10075734FY16, I10593076FY16, R10720868FY16) 
 Patients not Removed from the Dental Worklist
  
 Problem: 
 ======= 
 Two problems are occurring:  1.  studies with a status of "departed" 
 remain on the worklist and 2. There are studies with a status of 
 "scheduled" on the worklist but the consult shows "complete" in CPRS.  
  
 Resolution: 
 ========== 
 The system was corrected to check the Consult Request Tracking package 
 (GMRC) status and only generate the HL7 message if the study is active.
  
 3. Defect 392702 (Ticket I10884548FY16) Radiology Images not Showing 
 Modifiers
  
 Problem:  
 =======
 Some radiology images are no longer show the modifiers.  This problem has 
 to do with a change in P110 (part of Mega-bundle).  The change moved 
 radiology procedure modifiers in Modality Worklist (C-Find response) from 
 Requested Procedure Description (0032,1060) to Study comments 
 (0032,4000).  The Requested Procedure Description (0032,4000) now holds 
 the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) name.
  
 The result is that modality vendors are no longer displaying the 
 information they used to - specifically modifiers.
  
 Resolution:  
 ==========
 Support was added to allow the display of procedure modifiers and 
 technologist comments in multiple DICOM fields.
  
 Test Sites:
 ==========
 The following sites are test sites for this patch:
   Aleda E. Lutz Veteran's Administration Medical Center (VAMC) Saginaw
   Chalmers P. Wylie VA Ambulatory Care Center Columbus

 Patch Installation:
 ==================
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ==============================
 MAG*3.0*174 must be installed on the VistA System.  This patch must be 
 installed by the compliance date.
  
 All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of this 
 patch first.  This patch can be loaded while the VistA Imaging System is 
 active and users are on the system.  Installing the MAG*3.0*174 KIDS only 
 takes 2-3 minutes.  However, upgrading or installing the Legacy Digital 
 Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Gateway (LDGW) may take 
 15-45 minutes per instance; it depends on the complexity of the LDGW 
 configuration at the site.  Please make the installation plan according 
 to the site operation schedule and notify the local 
 administrator/users/providers.  Refer to the latest  Imaging DICOM 
 Gateway Installation Guide at the VA SharePoint site for more details:  
 http://vaww.oed.portal.domain.ext/applications/VistAImaging/default.aspx.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 =============================
 Verify that the patches listed in the Associated Patches section of this 
 document have been previously installed.
  
 Note:  All released VistA Imaging patches must be installed on the VistA 
 system before installing MAG*3.0*174.

 option if you want to ensure the integrity of the routines in the patch. 
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE TO SYSTEM] - 
 Run this option if you want to view all changes that will be made when 
 the patch is installed.  All components (routines, options, and so on) in 
 the patch will be compared.
   c. Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] - Run this option if you want 
 to create a backup message of any routines exported with the patch.  It 
 will NOT back up any of the other changes.
 5 After performing the load and any optional verification steps, install 
 the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
   a. Run the Install Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option.
   b. When prompted for the install name, enter "MAG*3.0*174".
