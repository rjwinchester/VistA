 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
  
 1. Defect 194669 (Tickets I9738934FY16, I10130099FY16, and 
 ==========================================================
 I10236113FY16) Anatomic Pathology Generating HL7 Email Alerts
 =============================================================
 Problem:  Multiple sites have reported receiving an email notification of 
 an HL7 Anatomic pathology issue.  The notification is:
  
 An error occurred in EDIT^MAGT7MA when trying to create and/or send an 
 HL7 message.  The error message is as follows:
  
 "-53`No test found in LAB(60) file for LRSS="SP""
 Please notify your local IRM Staff.
  
 Several issues were identified:
 1. The variables LRI and LRDFN are sometimes not being passed in the HL7 
 message from the Laboratory system to Telepathology.
 2. The Internal Entry Number (IEN) numbers for LAB codes CY (Cytology), 
 EM (Electron Microscopy) and SP (Surgical Pathology) were hardcoded, but 
 it was found that they can be different at each site.
  
 Resolution:  The following modifications were made:
 1. If the LRI or Data File Number (DFN) are null in the HL7 message, the 
 study is ignored.
 2. Instead of hardcoding the IEN associated with a lab code, the routine 
 was modified to look up the IEN of the procedure by searching the 
 LABORATORY TEST file #60 by the lab procedure.
  
 2. Defect 194632 (Tickets R9978605FY16 and I10155657FY16)  Text Gateway
 ======================================================================= 
 Error "PATIENT NOT IN DATABASE"
 ==============================
 Problem:  Sites are reporting that the Text Gateway was generating the 
 error "PATIENT NOT IN DATABASE" in the PID segment of HL7 messages which 
 delayed or halted Text Gateway processing.  This error occurred because 
 the LAB referral patient was not registered in the VistA Patient database.
  
 Some patients are defined within the laboratory package itself, but not 
 in the VistA Patient file.  For example, patients that are referrals are 
 in the REFERRAL PATIENT files (#67) but may not be in the VISTA PATIENT 
 file (#2).
  
 Resolution:  The new VistA MAGT7MA routine resolves this issue by 
 checking the PARENT FILE field (#.02) of the LAB DATA file (#63).  If the 
 PARENT FILE field is not "PATIENT", the order is skipped.
  
 Test Sites:

 The following sites are test sites for this patch:

 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 =================================================
 Software being released and/or documentation describing the new 
 functionality introduced by this patch are available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from 
 anonymous@download.vista.domain.ext from the COMMAND prompt (example:  
 sftp anonymous@download.vista.domain.ext). This transmits the files from 
 the first available server. 
  
 Sites may also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at the following OI Field Offices:
  
 When using Attachmate Reflection (Secure Shell):
 Albany:         domain.ext
 Hines:          domain.ext
 Salt Lake City: domain.ext

 Patch Installation:
 ==================
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ==============================
 MAG*3.0*173 must be installed on the VistA System.  This patch must be 
 installed by the compliance date to conform to VHA Directive 2001-023.
  
 All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of this 
 patch.  This patch can be loaded while the VistA Imaging System is active 
 and users are on the system.  Installing the MAG*3.0*173 KIDS only takes 
 2-3 minutes.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 =============================
 Verify that the patches listed in the Associated Patches section of this 
 document have been previously installed.
  
 Note:  All released VistA Imaging patches must be installed on the VistA 
 system before installing MAG*3.0*173.
  
 VistA System (KIDS) Installation Instructions 
 ============================================
 Installation Steps 
 ==================
 KIDS installation will take less than one minute.
 1. On the VistA system, access the Kernel Installation and Distribution 
 System Menu [XPD MAIN].
 2. Run the Installation option [XPD INSTALLATION MENU].
 3. Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
         a. Run the Load a Distribution option [XPD LOAD DISTRIBUTION] to 
 load the KIDS distribution.
         b. When prompted, enter the path and file name (MAG3_0P173.KID) 
 of the MAG*3.0*173 KIDS file.
         c. When prompted to continue with the load, enter "YES". A 
 Distribution OK! message will be displayed when the load is complete.
 4. After loading the KIDS file, use the following options to verify the 
 contents of the patch and to back up any affected routines.
         a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global [XPD PRINT CHECKSUM] - 
 Run this option if you want to ensure the integrity of the routines in 
 the patch. 
         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE TO 
 SYSTEM] - Run this option if you want to view all changes that will be 
 made when the patch is installed.  All components (routines, options, and 
 so on) in the patch will be compared.
         c. Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] - Run this option if 
 you want to create a backup message of any routines exported with the 
 patch.  It will NOT back up any of the other changes.
 5. After performing the load and any optional verification steps, install 
 the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
         a. Run the Install Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option.
         b. When prompted for the install name, enter "MAG*3.0*173".
         c. Answer "NO" to the following prompts, if they appear:
  
  Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO//
  Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//
  Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO//
  
 6. When installation is finished, an Install Complete message will be 
 displayed.
  
 KIDS Installation Example
 =========================
 This example shows the output when the KIDS file is installed for the 
 first time.  If you have already installed the patch and are installing 
 the KIDS file in a namespace on which it has previously been installed, 
 your output may be different.
  
 Uninstalling MAG*3.0*173
 ========================
 If it is necessary to uninstall the MAG*3.0*173 VistA KIDS, you needed to
 select the "Kernel Installation & Distribution System" menu option, 
 "Backup a Transport Global" (see installation section above, step 4c), 
 before you installed the patch.
  
 Administrators will need to use the PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK 
 MESSAGE.  Check your MailMan messages for the backup message sent by the 
 "Backup a Transport Global" function.
  
 1.  Select the message shown below:
  
 Backup of MAG*3.0*173 install on <mmm dd, yyyy>    <user name>
  
 2. Select the Xtract PackMan option.
 3. Select the Install/Check Message option.
 4. Enter "Yes" at the prompt.
 5. Enter "No" at the backup prompt.  There is no need to back up the 
    backup.
  
 Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore// Xtract PackMan
 Select PackMan function: ?
     Answer with PackMan function NUMBER, or NAME
    Choose from:
    1 ROUTINE LOAD
    2 GLOBAL LOAD
    3 PACKAGE LOAD
    4 SUMMARIZE MESSAGE
    5 PRINT MESSAGE
    6 INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE
    7 INSTALL SELECTED ROUTINE(S)
    8 TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY
    9 COMPARE MESSAGE
  
 Select PackMan function: Select PackMan function: 6  INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE
  
 Warning:  Installing this message will cause a permanent update of globals
 and routines.
 Do you really want to do this? NO// YES<Enter>
  
 Routines are the only parts that are backed up.  NO other parts
 are backed up, not even globals.  You may use the 'Summarize Message'
 option of PackMan to see what parts the message contains.
 Those parts that are not routines should be backed up separately
 if they need to be preserved.
  
 Shall I preserve the routines on disk in a separate back-up message? 
 YES// NO
 No backup message built.
