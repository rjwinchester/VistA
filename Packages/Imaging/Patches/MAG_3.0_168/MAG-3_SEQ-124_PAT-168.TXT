 Description:
 ===========
 The VistA Imaging Background Processor (BP) is a component in the 
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) 
 Imaging System.  The BP runs on a Windows file server. The Background 
 Processor ensures the archiving of Digital Imaging and Communications in 
 Medicine (DICOM) and clinical images from Tier 1 (configured in Redundant 
 Array of Independent Disks [RAID] groups) onto the Tier 2 shares for 
 long-term storage.  Currently, the BP is approved to run on a Microsoft 
 (MS) Server 2008 Operating System (OS).  MAG*3.0*168 is an informational 
 only patch to verify that the Background Processor operates correctly on 
 MS Windows Server 2012.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
  
 1.  Defect 391075  MS Windows Server 2012 Compatibility
 =======================================================
 Problem:  
 =======
 Currently, the BP is approved to run on an MS Server 2008 OS.  Sites are 
 upgrading their systems and it needs to be verified that the Background 
 Processor (BP) operates correctly on MS Windows Server 2012.
 Resolution:
 ==========
 VistA Imaging BP was tested to insure that it operates normally on MS 
 Windows Server 2012.
  
 2.  Defect 326481  Verifier Schedule
 ====================================
 Problem:
 =======
 The Verifier can be scheduled to run at certain times.  The M code that 
 starts the Verifier at the scheduled time checks that the Verifier is 
 running on certain Microsoft Operating Systems.  The list of allowed 
 operating systems did not include Microsoft Windows Server 2012.
 Resolution:
 ==========
 The M code has been modified to allow the Verifier to run on MS Windows 
 Server 2012.
  
 Test Sites:
 ==========
 The following sites are test sites for this patch:
  
    VISN 15 Eastern Orbit VA Heartland Network- Marion
    VISN15 Western Orbit VA Heartland Network- Topeka
    Mountain Home VA Medical Center
    Fayetteville VAMC

 Jukebox/Import Queue Failure Fix
 Issues have been reported with JUKEBOX and IMPORT queue failures on 
 2008/2012 servers on the Background Processor (BP) that were not seen on 
 2003 servers.  This failure was traced back to a setting in the SMB2 
 protocol where a local cache is created for the remote directory. 
 Modifying the registry to disable this setting fixes the issue.  Below 
 are a couple of articles that describe the issue and the fix.

 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5159220/windows-file-share-why-sometime
 s-newly-created-files-arent-visible-for-some-pe
  
 This fix should be applied to both Storage Cluster (SC) members as well 
 as all BPs.  To apply the queue failure fix, contact Clin 3 to get the 
 registry file and follow the steps below:
  
 1.      Double click on the file:  JukeboxImportQueueRegistryFixreg.reg 
  
  
  
 2.      When prompted, click "Yes" to continue.
 3.      You should see a "Success" information popup.  Click "OK".
 4.      You have added the registry fix.
