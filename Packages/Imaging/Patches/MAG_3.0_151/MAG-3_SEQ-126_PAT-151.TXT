 Description:
 ===========
 MAG*3.0*151 has fixes for the Clinical Capture Client.  Some of the 
 issues resolved in this patch are as follows:  The Progress Notes window 
 has been modified to fix errors when returning a list of patient notes.  
 Abstracts are now created for PDF files.  Specialty and Proc/Event values 
 are now correctly saved and there is a new option to add additional 
 images to an existing image group.  Additional details are included in 
 the list of patient consult note titles.  TWAIN device sharing issues are 
 fixed.  Unsigned Notes are now correctly displayed for a patient.  Prior 
 to this patch, the user was incorrectly prompted for patient selection 
 when the Select Lab Specimen button was clicked.
  
 The Date/Time dialogue correctly displays AM/PM for selected time.  There 
 is a new Option to display configuration buttons on the top or left of 
 the window and changes to captured PDF images (rotate) are now saved 
 correctly. Changes to Imported images (rotate/deskew/invert) are also 
 now correctly saved.
  
 Annotations are no longer created in the Clinical Capture application.  
 Clinical Capture will open the Annotation window in Clinical Display, 
 Version 167.  The user will also have the option to open an image from the
 Latest Patient Images window and have that image open in the Annotation
 window of Clinical Display.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1.  Defect 194619 (Trouble Ticket INC000000386352)  VistA Imaging Deskew 
 =========================================================================
 Problem:
 When an image is scanned and deskewed, the deskew is successful.  The 
 image is deskewed when opened from VistA Imaging Clinical Display. When an
 Image is IMPORTED and then deskewed, the deskew looks successful but the
 image is not actually deskewed when opened from the VistA Imaging Display.
  
 Resolution:
 In the VI Capture application, the functions that save the changes to 
 images have been fixed.  These functions include:  rotate, invert, deskew 
 and despeckle.
  
 2.  Defect 194631 (Trouble Ticket INC000000919790)  Imaging - Clinical 
 ======================================================================
 Capture Access Violation Error
 ==============================
 Problem:
 A document is scanned into DSS DocManager.  DocManager is minimized and 
 VI Capture is opened and a document scanned.  Then another document scan 
 is started in DocManager and the following error is displayed:  "A 
 general fault of the MSG_OPENDS response. (Internally) There has been a 
 sharing violation. Twain source may be in use. (Code: DSf0171)."  
 Additionally, if another attempt is made to scan a document into VI 
 Capture, an "Access Violation" error is displayed.
  
 Resolution:
 The application design was modified so that any TWAIN device in use is 
 closed after each scan.  This will enable multiple TWAIN devices to be 
 active on the workstation.
  
 3.  Defect 194643 (Trouble Tickets INC000000591246, INC000001037608)
 ====================================================================  
 Limited to Selecting Fewer than 100 Notes in Clinical Capture
 =============================================================
  
 Problem:
 In MAG*3.0*140, when selecting more than 100 notes in Clinical Capture, 
 an error is being produced:  <PARAMETER>TGET^TIUSRVR1.  
  
 Resolution:
 The code that retrieves the list of Text Integration Utility (TIU) Notes 
 for a patient was modified.  Only 100 Notes are retrieved at one time.  
 The user can then retrieve the next 100 notes until the desired note is 
 listed.
  
 4.  Defect 194644 (Trouble Ticket INC000000940905)  PDF not Saving
 ================================================================== 
 Correctly
 =========
 Problem:
 In MAG*3.0*140, using settings for TWAIN/Color 24 bit/PDF/Multiple pages 
 results in the document not saving correctly.  When using the same 
 settings and a document is rotated left or right and then saved, the 
 settings are not saving.  In the Clinical Display client, the document 
 must be rotated again.
  
 Resolution:
 The functions that save changes to the captured image were modified.  
 These include:  rotate, invert, deskew and despeckle.
  
 5.  Defect 194646 (Trouble Ticket INC000000985487)  Queuing Abs for PDF 
 =======================================================================
 Issue
 =====
 Problem:
 There are daily failures in the Jukebox queue involving abstracts for 
 scanned documents.  The full image is available to the provider.  This 
 issue is that the abstract/thumbnail may not be available to the VI 
 Display client.  This issue began after the Patch 140 client was 
 installed.  Re-queueing them the same day does not work.  After the 
 Verifier runs that night, they can be re-queued successfully.  It creates 
 the canned "Acrobat document" abstract. 
  
 Resolution:
 This is a two-part fix in two different patches:  the Background 
 Processor Patch, MAG*3.0*158 (Released) and this patch.  In this patch, 
 abstracts are now created for PDF files.
  
 6.  Defect 194659 (Trouble Ticket INC000001219914)  Update Clinical 
 ===================================================================
 Capture Annotation Should be the Same as Clinical Display Annotation
 ====================================================================
 Problem:
 The annotation functionality in the Clinical Capture was causing access 
 violations and issues with changes to the Clinical Capture image (rotate, 
 deskew, invert functions).
  
 Resolution:
 The annotation functionality has been taken out of the Clinical Capture 
 client.  Annotation of images will only be done in Clinical Display.  The 
 next  Clinical Display patch, MAG*3.0*167, will have the functionality to 
 automatically open images for annotation when requested by the Clinical 
 Capture user.
  
 7.  Defect 194662 (Trouble Ticket INC000001006050 Patients' 
 ===========================================================
 Information not Refreshing in Clinical Capture after Patch 140
 ==============================================================
 Problem:
 The Unsigned Notes list for a patient is not being completely refreshed 
 when switching from one patient to the next.
  
 Resolution:
 The procedure that clears the TIU Notes window was modified and a step 
 was added to the Clear Unsigned/Uncosigned Notes listing.
  
 8. Defect 194670 (Trouble Ticket INC000001015982) Clinical Capture 
 ==================================================================
 AM/PM Indicator Issue
 =====================
 Problem:
 The Date/Time selections for the Note Date and Document/Image Date Index 
 fields in Clinical Capture does not display an AM/PM indicator. 
  
 Resolution:
 The code was modified so that when any time option is selected on the 
 time selection of the Date/Time dialog, "AM" or "PM" is correctly 
 displayed.
  
 9. Defect 251277 (Trouble Ticket R6629905FY16) Update and Remove Outdated
 =========================================================================
 or Non-functioning Menu Options in Clinical Capture
 ===================================================
 Problem:
 There are several outdated or non-functioning menu options in the 
 Clinical Capture application that need to be removed.  The Help Menu 
 option needs to link to the current user manual on the VistA Imaging 
 SharePoint site.
  
 Resolution:
 The code was modified to remove old/unused menu items and a new menu item 
 was added:  Help | VistA Imaging Capture User Guide.  This new item links 
 to the current VI Capture User Guide on the VI SharePoint site.  Old menu 
 items can be displayed, if needed, by setting the mag.ini property as:  
 "Show Old Menu Items" = TRUE.
  
 10. Defect 251283 (Trouble Ticket I6220885FY16) Spec and Event are 
 ==================================================================
 Hidden but Not Cleared when the Association Changes
 ===================================================
 Problem:
 In Clinical Capture, the user populates the Specialty and Procedure/Event 
 field for a clinical image and saves the image.  Switching the 
 association to "Administrative" for the next image capture doesn't clear 
 the Specialty and Procedure/Events fields, even though they are hidden 
 from the user.  After the Administrative image is saved, the Specialty 
 and Procedure/Event fields of the Administrative image have the values of 
 the previous image.
  
 Resolution:
 The code was modified to correctly clear the Specialty and 
 Procedure/Event fields after an image is captured.
  
 11.  Defect 251378 (Trouble Ticket R6630245FY16) Add Option to Move 
 ===================================================================
 Configuration Button Bar Location in Clinical Capture
 =====================================================
  
 Problem:
 If there are an excessive number of configuration buttons at the top of 
 the Clinical Capture window, the viewable area becomes unusable.  There 
 needs to be a way to move the toolbar to the left side of the screen.
  
 Resolution:
 New menu options were added on the Clinical Capture window Options menu 
 and on the popup menu of the configuration button/s toolbar.  This change 
 gives users the ability to display configuration buttons on the left or 
 on the top of the window.  Settings are saved to the workstation in the 
 mag.ini configuration file.  When displayed on the left, the image 
 remains full size so the user can see more of the content.
  
 12. Defect 251398 (Trouble Ticket R6630066FY16) Modify Clinical
 =============================================================== 
 Capture for TIU Business Rules
 ==============================
 Problem:
 The Latest Patient Images option does not recognize existing TIU Business 
 Rules.  Anyone can view images using this option regardless of the TIU 
 Business Rule for a given note title.
  
 Resolution:
 The code was modified in the Latest Patient Images window.  TIU Business 
 Rules are now applied when an image is displayed.  If the user cannot 
 view the TIU Note because of the TIU Business Rule, then the image will 
 not be displayed.
  
 13. Defect 251403 (Trouble Ticket INC000001102346) Patient Lookup
 ================================================================= 
 Window Displays if Select Lab Specimen Button is Clicked before Selecting
 =========================================================================
 Patient
 =======
 Problem:
 The Patient Lookup window displays if the Select Lab Specimen button is 
 clicked before selecting the patient, which did not occur in MAG*3.0*122. 
  
 Resolution:
 The section of code that was incorrectly prompting for Patient Selection 
 when the Lab window was closed, was fixed.  The Patient Selection window 
 is no longer displayed inappropriately. 
  
 14. Defect 251409 (Trouble Ticket INC000001103554) Text displayed In 
 ====================================================================
 the Imaging Workstation Configuration Window Gives the User the Wrong
 =====================================================================
 Impression of Features
 ======================
 Problem:
 In the Imaging Workstation Configuration Window, the text displayed gives 
 the user the wrong impression of features.  Text that states:  "Combine 
 images from multiple sources." refers to an option that is not available 
 to the user. 
  
 Resolution:
 The incorrect wording on the Imaging Workstation Configuration window has 
 been removed.
  
 15. Defect  251411 (Trouble Ticket INC000001103559) "Capture By" is Null
 ========================================================================
 Problem:
 There are some DICOM Images (captured by DICOM Gateway) where the field 
 "Capture By" is null.  If "Capture By" is null, the images are listed as  
 <undefined> in the QA Review Report. 
  
 Resolution:
 Code was changed to not list images captured by the DICOM Gateway.  If 
 the "Captured by" value is null (this is an error in the database), " 
 <undefined>" will be listed as the user.
  
 16.  Remedy Ticket INC000000932130 (Defect:  258889):  Access Violations 
 ========================================================================
 in Capture on VI Client PC
 ==========================
 Problem:
 When scanning an image using VI Clinical Capture, users are occasionally 
 receiving access violations.
  
 Resolution:
 The functions to annotate an image, display an image, and copy an image 
 have been optimized to fix the issue.
  
 17.  Defect 258896 (Trouble Ticket INC000000918450) Remove Un-applicable
 ========================================================================
 Display Option
 ==============
 Problem:
 When trying to change the number of notes that return for a selection, 
 users can choose something other than 100 but it will not return any more 
 than 100.  Display options that no longer apply were not removed from the 
 Progress Notes list window, causing confusion.  Only 100 notes are 
 returned and the user needs to click the MORE button for the next 100 
 notes to be displayed.
  
 Resolution:
 The Progress Notes list window was modified.  The options were taken off 
 that no longer apply like Month Ranges, etc. The interface is now easier 
 to understand and more intuitive.
  
 18.  Defect 251373 (Trouble Ticket I6243085FY16) Need Consult ID Number as
 ==========================================================================
 Viewable Column in Clinical Capture for Consult Note Titles
 ===========================================================
 Problem:
 From the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Consults tab, the 
 listing of Consults includes the date, status, service, and consult 
 number.  This listing is in reverse chronological order, with the most 
 recent consult at the top of the list. 
 The issue reported with VistA Imaging Clinical Capture is that the list 
 of consults is not in reverse chronological order.  When viewed from 
 Clinical Capture, the first item displayed in the list is the first item 
 entered for the given date; it is not the most recent item.
  
 Resolution:
 The list of consults in Clinical Capture is now sorted by the same value 
 as the list of consults in CPRS.  Also,  the consult ID# is a new column 
 in the listing.  The user can compare the consult ID # if needed, to 
 select the correct consult.
  
 19.  Defect 351975 (Trouble Ticket I9770783FY16)  Inactive Users
 =================================================================
 Selected as Author of a New Progress Note
 =========================================
 Problem:
 When an image is captured and attached to a new TIU Progress Note, 
 authors whose status in the VistA System was Inactive were able to be 
 selected.  When this happened, the new Note was not able to be signed.  
 In this situation the image was not viewable by users of Clinical Display.
 Resolution: 
 When an Inactive user is selected as the author of a new Progress Note, a 
 Warning Dialog box is displayed to the user of Clinical Capture.  The 
 author's Inactive status is displayed and the user is prompted to select 
 a different user for the author of the Progress Note. 
  
 20.  Defect 291848 (Trouble Ticket (NSD) I6837874FY16) Imaging Users 
 ====================================================================
 Undefined in Reports
 ====================
 Problem:
 Imaging users are showing up as undefined in QA Review reports.  They are 
 unable to see where the undefined images are coming from.  VistA Imaging 
 QA Review does not allow us to select <undefined>.
 Resolution:
 Users that show up as <undefined> are associated with images that have 
 been captured through the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine 
 (DICOM) Gateway.  These images are not intended to be included in QA 
 Review reports.  A change in the QA Review reporting function will no 
 longer count these images and users of the QA Review reporting function 
 will no longer see <undefined>.
