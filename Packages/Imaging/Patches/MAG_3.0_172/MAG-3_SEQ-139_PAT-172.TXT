 HYBRID DIGITAL IMAGING AND COMMUNICATIONS IN MEDICINE (DICOM) IMAGE 
 GATEWAY (HDIG) DUPLICATED UNIQUE IDENTIFIER (UID) CHECKING OPTION
  
 Category:  OTHER
 ========
  
 Description:
 ===========
 This patch fixes a problem with creating a duplicate when a resend of the 
 same object has different series or Service Object Pair (SOP) UIDs.  When
 running a test on Fluoroscopy, the SR object was stored on an initial
 send, as expected.  The data was verified in the various files.  When it
 was resent, the Strutureed Report (SR) object was stored again and the
 imaging RAD dose files were populated again, doubling the radiation dose
 information erroneously.
  
 More in line with the DICOM standard, if the same image/instance UID comes
 in more than once, it is the same image, and therefore should be rejected.
  
 NOTE: This patch must be installed before Patch RA*5*119.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
 1.      Defect 319552 (Trouble Ticket: R12543049FY17) Change How HDIG is 
 Handling DICOM Objects
  
 Problem:  
 When running a test on Fluoroscopy, the SR object was stored on an 
 initial send, as expected.  The data was verified in the various files.  
 When it was resent, the SR object was stored again and the imaging
 RAD dose files were populated again, doubling the radiation dose
 information erroneously.
  
 More in line with the DICOM standard, if the same image/instance UID 
 comes in more than once, it is the same image, and therefore should be
 rejected.
  
 Resolution:  
 On duplicate series or SOP Instance UID reception, the object will not be 
 stored and the reject message will be sent to the vendor. 
 If a duplicate Series UID is detected under another patient, order
 (Accession Number,) or study (Case 1) or if a duplicate Instance UID is
 received under another patient, order (Accession Number), study, or series
 (Case 2), then the incoming object will now be rejected (if the
 rejectDuplicates option is set to "true" instead of generating a new UID).
 If an object comes in with a duplicate Series UID AND a duplicate Instance
 UID under the same patient, order (Accession Number), and study, it is a
 resend, so nothing is stored and the sender receives a "SUCCESS"
 response.  Case 3 also is possible: If an object comes in with a duplicate
 Series AND a duplicate Instance UID under another patient, order
 (Accession Number), and study (Case 1 and 2 combined), it is rejected just
 like for Case 1.
  
 MAG*3.0*172 introduces an HDIG DICOM server configuration flag, 
 "rejectDuplicates", where if set "true", the HDIG DICOM server rejects
 (does not store) Series and SOP Instance duplicates without remembering
 them.  It will still log the findings and reason for rejection.  Without
 this option turned on, the HDIG behaves like before (since Patch 34); it
 generates new UIDs for duplicate UID findings, stores the instance with
 the UIDs and remembers each incident in IMAGING DUPLICATE UID LOG #2005.66
 Re-send and illegal UID detection is not affected by this change.  If a
 new "rejectDuplicates" option flag does not exist in the HDIG's
 DicomServerConfiguration.config file, the HDIG acts like before.  (The
 default setting is "false".)

 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 =================================================
 Software being released and/or documentation describing the new 
 functionality introduced by this patch are available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext. 
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites mayalso 
 elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directory at the following OI Field Offices:
  
 Hines:          domain.ext  
 Salt Lake City: domain.ext
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at: http://www4.domain.ext/vdl/.
  
 Patch Installation:
 ==================
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ==============================
 MAG*3.0*172 must be installed on both the VistA System and on 64-bit HDIG 
 servers.  This patch must be installed by the compliance date.
  
 All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of this 
 patch.  Installing the MAG*3.0*172 KIDS takes 2-5 minutes.
  
 Note:  HDIG will not install on 32-bit machines with a Windows operating 
 system such as 2003 Server.  There is also a known issue if there are
 multiple Java versions on the system for HDIG:
      For a fresh installation, remove all installed Java applications 
 before the installation of MAG*3.0*172
      If updating, remove installed Java if it's not version 1.6.0_45
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 =============================
 Verify that the patches listed in the Associated Patches section of this 
 document have been previously installed.
  
 Note:  All released VistA Imaging patches must be installed on the VistA 
 system before installing MAG*3.0*172.
  
 VistA System (KIDS) Installation Instructions 
 =============================================
 Installation Steps 
 ==================
 KIDS installation will take less than one minute.
 1. On the VistA system, access the Kernel Installation and Distribution 
 System Menu [XPD MAIN].
 2. Run the Installation option [XPD INSTALLATION MENU].
 3. Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
    a. Run the Load a Distribution option [XPD LOAD DISTRIBUTION] to load 
 the KIDS distribution.
    b. When prompted, enter the path and file name (MAG3_0P172.KID) of the 
 MAG*3.0*172 KIDS file.
    c. When prompted to continue with the load, enter "YES". A Distribution
 OK! message will be displayed when the load is complete.
 4. After loading the KIDS file, use the following options to verify the 
 contents of the patch and to back up any affected routines.
    a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global [XPD PRINT CHECKSUM] - Run this
 option if you want to ensure the integrity of the routines in the patch.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE TO SYSTEM] 
 - Run this option if you want to view all changes that will be made when
 the patch is installed.  All components (routines, options, and so on) in
 the patch will be compared.
    c. Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] - Run this option if you want
 to create a backup message of any routines exported with the patch.  It
 will NOT back up any of the other changes.
 5. After performing the load and any optional verification steps, install 
 the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
    a. Run the Install Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option.
    b. When prompted for the install name, enter "MAG*3.0*172".
    c. Answer "NO" to the following prompts, if they appear:
  
  Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO//
  Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//
  Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO//
  
 6. When installation is finished, an Install Complete message will be 
 displayed.

 Uninstalling MAG*3.0*172
 ========================
 If it is necessary to uninstall the MAG*3.0*172 VistA KIDS, you needed to 
 select the "Kernel Installation & Distribution System" menu option,
 "Backup a Transport Global" (see installation section above, step 4c),
 before you installed the patch.
  
 Administrators will need to use the PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK 
 MESSAGE.  Check your MailMan messages for the backup message sent by the
 "Backup a Transport Global" function.
  
 1.       Select the message shown below:
  
 Backup of MAG*3.0*172 install on <mmm dd, yyyy>    <user name>
  
 2.      Select the Xtract PackMan option.
 3.      Select the Install/Check Message option.
 4.      Enter "Yes" at the prompt.
 5.      Enter "No" at the backup prompt.  There is no need to back up the 
 backup.
  
 Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore// Xtract PackMan

 Select PackMan function: Select PackMan function: 6  INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE
  
 Warning:  Installing this message will cause a permanent update of globals
 and routines.
 Do you really want to do this? NO// YES<Enter>
  
 Routines are the only parts that are backed up.  NO other parts
 are backed up, not even globals.  You may use the 'Summarize Message'
 option of PackMan to see what parts the message contains. Those parts that
 are not routines should be backed up separately if they need to be
 preserved.
  
 Shall I preserve the routines on disk in a separate back-up message? 
 YES// NO
 No backup message built.
