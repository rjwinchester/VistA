 Subject:  TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION FOR TELEREADER AND TELEREADER 
 =======
 CONFIGURATOR
  
 Category:  OTHER
 ========
  
 Description:
 ===========
 MAG*3.0*182 provides two-factor authentication (2FA) for the TeleReader 
 and TeleReader Configurator applications.  When the user starts either 
 application, they will be prompted for their Personal Identity 
 Verification (PIV)/Personal Identification Number (PIN) to log into 
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA).  
 In order to implement 2FA for these applications, the development 
 environment was upgraded to Delphi XE8.  There are no other changes to 
 functionality of either application.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
 1.Update TeleReader with 2FA
 ============================
 Problem:  Per the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) mandate to 
 meet PIV requirements (VAIQ #7712300), all existing systems must be 
 upgraded to use PIV credentials for authentication.
  
 Resolution:  The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker establishes a common 
 and consistent connection for VistA client/server applications.  The 
 kernel development team has updated the RPC Broker to accept a PIV for 
 authentication in XWB*1.1*64 and RPC Broker Development Tool Kit 
 XWB*1.1*65.  The RPC Broker client component uses the Identity and Access 
 Management (IAM) SSOi Secure Token Service (STS) for Authentication.  The 
 client authenticates to IAM with PIV/PIN and obtains a Security Assertion 
 Markup Language (SAML) token; this token is associated with a VistA 
 access/verify code and is used to authenticate to VistA.
  
 Test Sites:
 ==========
 The following site is a test site for this patch:
   VA Salt Lake City Health Care System
  
 *A test waiver has been approved to allow for testing to proceed with one 
 site.
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 =================================================
 Software being released and/or documentation describing the new 
 functionality introduced by this patch are available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from 
 anonymous@download.vista.domain.ext from the COMMAND prompt (example:  
 sftp anonymous@download.vista.domain.ext). This transmits the files from 
 the first available server. 
  
 Sites may also elect to retrieve software and/or documentation files 
 directly from a specific server or by using Secure File Transfer Protocol 
 (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following OI Field 
 Offices:
  
 When using Attachmate Reflection (Secure Shell):
 Albany:         domain.ext
 Hines:          domain.ext
 Salt Lake City: domain.ext
  
 When using the COMMAND prompt (example: sftp 
 anonymous@domain.ext): 
 Albany:         anonymous@domain.ext
 Hines:          anonymous@domain.ext
 Salt Lake City: anonymous@domain.ext
