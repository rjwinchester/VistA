 Defect Tracking System Tickets
 ==============================
 1.    Defect 779843 (Trouble Ticket # INC0203475) Not enough logging to 
       debug the Verifier when it has stopped working or has other issues.
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 A site reported that the verifier had stopped working and the log files 
 did not contain enough information to debug the issue.
  
 Resolution:  
 ===========
 The Verifier debugging functionality has changed in MAG*3.0*222. 
 Previously, debug mode was only enabled when the Verifier was being run 
 over a range of images. It was not available during auto verify or 
 scheduled verify. In previous versions, debug information was logged for 
 all Image IEN's that were processed. This constant logging produced very 
 large debug logs. 
 Errors that occur are usually the same error repeated each time an IEN is 
 processed. In this version of the Verifier, debug information is only 
 logged when an error occurs. After 30 errors,  debug mode is turned off. 
 Turning off debug mode reduces the size of the Debug Log. This provides 
 enough information to troubleshoot without filling up the local hard 
 drive with repetitive data. 
  
 To turn debug mode on, the configuration file: C:\program files 
 (x86)\vista\imaging\backproc\magBP.ini must be modified.   
    1.   Open Microsoft Notepad as Administrator by right clicking the 
         Notepad and selecting "Run as administrator".  
    2.   Select File->Open from the menu bar and navigate to the 
         C:\program files (x86)\vista\imaging\backproc\ directory.  
    3.   Make sure All Files (*.*) is selected in the lower right-hand 
         corner and select the magBP.ini file and click Open.
    4.   Add '[Verifier] (if it isn't there) and add the line    
 'DebugToFile = TRUE'  
 Example:
 [Verifier]
 DebugToFile=TRUE
  
 To enable debug mode for the Scheduled Verifier, set DebugToFile=TRUE. 
 The verifier will create a 
 .\imaging\backproc\log\verifier\VerifierDebugLog-<mmdd-hhmmss>.log file 
 when the first error occurs. 
  
 If DebugToFile=FALSE, then debugging will be off when the Verifier 
 starts. If the Verifier is started manually, then the debugging can be 
 turned on by checking the menu item: 'Help | Debugging Log'.
  
 The VerifierDebugLog files will be stored in the local folder and will 
 NOT be copied to the network log folder specified in the BP Server 
 definition.
  
 2.    Defect 778414 (Trouble Ticket # INC1210375) Unable to update the 
       Default User Preferences field in the Imaging Site Parameters screen
       of the Background Processor.
  
 Problem:
 ======== 
 In the Background Processor - Imaging Site Parameters screen, when the 
 Default User Preference is updated it does not save when selecting the 
 Apply or OK button.
  
 Resolution:  
 ===========
 The Default User Preference will now be saved when selecting Apply or OK 
 button. 
  
 3.    Defect 870794 (Trouble Ticket # INC3201421) The icon on the About 
       Imaging for Windows screen in both Queue Processor and Purge is
       incorrect.
  
 Problem:  
 ========
     1. The Icon on the About Imaging for windows screen that displays
        when the user selects Help->About in the Queue Processor is showing
        the wrong patch number.
     2. The Icon on the About Imaging for windows screen that displays
        when the user selects Help->About in the Purge utility is showing
        the image.
  
 Resolution:   
 ===========
 This issue was fixed by:
     1. Replacing the Queue Processor Icon with one that did not include
        the patch number on it.
     2. Replacing the old icon with a new icon labeled "PURGE".
  
 4.    Defect 830511 (Trouble Ticket # INC2311522) Error when editing 
       the Queue Pause (Delay) field.
  
 Problem:
 ========  
 The user is receiving an error when setting the Pause (Delay) field, 
 which controls how fast a queue is processed. If the user tries to edit 
 the field manually without using the drop-down list by deleting or 
 backspacing to remove the entry, then multiple "is not a valid integer 
 value" errors occur.  The Queue Process must be closed to stop the error. 
  
 Resolution:   
 ===========
 This defect is addressed by modifying the code to correct the error when 
 the user deletes the value in the Pause (Delay) field.  If the Pause 
 (Delay) field is empty, less than zero or contains alphanumeric 
 characters, the Pause (Delay) field will be set to 1000 and an error is 
 no longer displayed.
  
 5.    Defect 899824: Import Queue Error.
  
 Problem:  
 ========
 After installing P222T1 sites started getting an Access Denied error 
 message when running the Import Queue.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========   
 When adding the debugging logging code, variables were omitted causing an 
 error in the Import Queue.  Two variables in the code were changed to 
 static-class variables, eliminating the run time error that was being 
 raised within the BP program.
  
 6.    Defect 950835: Test menu option is being displayed.
  
 Problem:  
 ========
 After installing P222T2 sites reported that the test menu option was 
 being displayed on the menu bar which is only used by developers for 
 debugging.
  
 Resolution:   
 ===========
 The application was updated to remove the debug (Test) menu from user's 
 view.

 8. After the installation of MAG*3.0*222, there should be one entry 
    in Control Panel | Programs and Features for the Background Processor 
    applications:
      MAG*3.0*222: VistA Imaging Background Processor 222     30.54.222.nn
  
 New Server Installation:
 ========================
 MAG*3.0*222 contains all the Background Processor and Background 
 Processor utility applications. It will install on a new server that 
 hasn't had a previous BP installed. 
 Desktop shortcuts for the Purge, Verifier, and Background Processor Queue 
 Processor are automatically created on the desktop. 
  
 If installing the BP Queue Processor, BP Verifier, and BP Purge on a 
 64-bit operating system such as Windows 2012 Server, then "Run as 
 administrator" must be manually set using the check box in the Advanced 
 Properties window on each of the desktop shortcuts and the menu options. 
 Do this for all three client applications.
  
 If the MAG*3.0*222 Background Processor client is installed before 
 installing the MAG*3.0*222 KIDS, then a message will display when the 
 client is run that says, "the versions of the Background Processor client 
 and the version of the VistA Imaging host system are not compatible." The 
 user will be prompted to install compatible versions of the Background 
 Processor client and the VistA system host software. If such a message 
 displays, then complete the following steps: 
 1.  Shut down the Background Processor client. 
 2.  Install the MAG*3.0*222 KIDS. 
 Now run the MAG*3.0*222 Background Processor client.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions: 
 ===============================
 Restart all Background Processor applications that were stopped for 
 installation.
