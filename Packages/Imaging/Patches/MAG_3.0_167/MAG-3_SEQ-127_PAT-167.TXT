 Description:
 ===========
 This document describes MAG*3.0*167, a patch that includes a new MUSE 
 Patient Study Viewer. This version of the MUSE Patient Study Viewer will 
 connect to MUSE Systems that are running MUSE v8 SP2 and later.  The 
 electrocardiograms (EKGs) and other data types displayed in this viewer 
 are MUSE generated Portable Document Format (PDF) images of the patient 
 tests.  Additionally, MAG*3.0*167 will have communication with Clinical 
 Capture for Annotation of Patient Images.  In MAG*3.0*151, the Annotation 
 components were taken out of Clinical Capture.  Users of Clinical Capture 
 151 have the option to open newly captured images in Clinical Display 
 patch MAG*3.0*167.  Images are opened in a separate window, so the user 
 can annotate the image using the Annotation components of Clinical 
 Display.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
  
  
 1. Defect 194658 (Trouble Ticket (Remedy) INC000000995412) Cannot Add
 ===================================================================== 
 Annotations to Images 
 =====================
  
 Problem:
 In the current version of the Clinical Display application, it is not 
 possible to add Annotations to images that have a status of Quality 
 Assurance (QA) Reviewed.  This needs to be changed so that Annotations 
 can be added to images that have a status of QA Reviewed.
  
 Resolution:
 The function that determines if an Image can be annotated was incorrect.  
 This function has been fixed to allow annotations to images with a status 
 of QA Reviewed. 
  
 2. Defect 359102 (Trouble Ticket INC000001219914) Enable Communication
 ====================================================================== 
 from Clinical Capture to Allow Users to Annotate Images
 =======================================================
  
 Problem:
 In Clinical Capture MAG*3.0*151, the annotation functionality was removed 
 due to issues it was causing in the capture process.
  
 Resolution:
 This patch enables communication between Clinical Capture and Clinical 
 Display.  Users of Clinical Capture MAG*3.0*151 can select a newly 
 captured image and have it open in a separate window of Clinical Display 
 MAG*3.0*167 for annotation. 
  
 3. Defect 291827 MUSE API Update 
 ================================
 Problem:
 General Electric (GE) has developed a new Application Programming 
 Interface (MUSE API 3).  The use of the new API will be mandatory for the 
 upcoming MUSE Version 9.  Clinical Display Electrocardiogram Viewer 
 currently uses an older MUSE API that will not communicate with MUSE 9. 
  
 Resolution:
 The VistA Imaging Clinical Display application has been modified to use 
 the new MUSE API 3 to interface with GE MUSE Systems.  This change will 
 enable VistA Imaging Display to interface with MUSE Systems starting with 
 MUSE v8 SP2 and later.  MUSE Systems older than MUSE v8 SP2 will no 
 longer be supported. 
  
 4. Defect 359130 (Trouble Ticket (NSD)  R6629905FY16) Help Menu Items
 ===================================================================== 
 (continued from Patch 151)
 ==========================
 Problem:
 Users do not have access to the latest Display User Manual.  The Help 
 menu option needs to link to the current user manual on the VistA Imaging 
 SharePoint site.
  
 Resolution:
 A new menu item has been added to the Help menu on the Clinical Display 
 main window:  VistA Imaging Display User Guide.  This is a link to the 
 VistA Imaging SharePoint site. 
 Click this menu option to open the latest Clinical Display User Manual in 
 your browser.
  
 5.   Defect 291819 (Trouble Tickets INC000000947908,
 ==================================================== 
 INC000001006100, and INC000001067134) Image Goes Black
 ======================================================
 Problem:
 When scrolling through the images on the Radiologic viewer with the 
 Telereader for Teleretinal Imaging, the images go black.  Users have to 
 logout of the VistA Imaging Display client and log back in to make them 
 viewable again.
  
 Resolution:
 In the current design of Clinical Display, whenever a 24 bit color image 
 is viewed, it is automatically separated into Red, Green and Blue (RGB) 
 color channels.  The memory used to store these images was not being 
 cleared when the image was cleared, so continually viewing 24-bit color 
 images would eventually lead to the application running out of memory. 
 There is a two part resolution for this issue:
 1) The memory used for the separate color channels is now being cleared 
 when the image is cleared.
 2) Users can choose to disable the automatic separation of color channels 
 for 24-bit color images.  By disabling the automatic separation, color 
 images will load and display faster.  When disabled, the user can choose 
 to show color channels on an image by image basis. 
 To disable atomatic color channels, from the Main window or from the 
 Image List Window, check the Options | Disable Automatic Color Channel 
 menu option .
 To view color channels when automatic color channel is disabled, select 
 the Image | Enable Color Channel for Current Image menu option.  Then use 
 the RGB toolbutton as you normally would. 
  
 6. Defect 377985 (Trouble Ticket I7668256FY16) Typos on VistA Imaging 
 =====================================================================
 Banner
 =====
 Problem:
 The box that displays after the user enters an electronic signature for 
 printing or copying images (titled: "VistA Imaging: Physcian Agreement 
 for Downloaded Images.") has two misspellings. The word "physician" was 
 misspelled and there should not be a period at the end of the title bar. 
 Also, the word "capability" in the second line is also misspelled.
  
 Resolution:
 The two spelling errors were fixed and the extra period was removed.
  
 7. Defect 291820 (Trouble Tickets INC000001057750 and INC000001248569) 
 ======================================================================
 Image Displaying as Black Vertical Strip
 ========================================
 Problem:
 Ophthalmic images are coming across distorted.  The images come up in 
 Clinical Display as a black vertical strip.  To view full size, clear 
 images, users need to click on the 1:1 option.
 Resolution:
 During the display of DICOM images, a secondary calculation is performed 
 to compute the image resolution based on pixel spacing data contained in 
 the DICOM header.  Sometimes the data is incomplete.  When the data for 
 the vertical pixel spacing is incomplete, the secondary calculation 
 results in an image that is dramatically skewed vertical.  The image 
 displays as a vertical line.
 The application function that calculates the image height and width has 
 been modified.  When data for pixel spacing is incomplete, the secondary 
 calculation will not be executed.
 The verical line issue was noticed when viewing images from the vendor 
 TopCon.  The user can optionally stop resolution calculations for all 
 TopCon images.
 From the System Manager menu, select "Workstation Configuration 
 window.".  In the Workstation Configuration window, select the Demo 
 Options section.  Under "Demo Options" set the value for 
 SkipTopConResolution to "TRUE".
  
 8. Defect 291822 (Trouble Tickets I6260205FY16 and I10071786FY16) RGB 
 =====================================================================
 Button
 ======
 Problem:
 In VistA Imaging Clinical Display, the Red/Green/Blue (RGB) button 
 becomes inactive while viewing patient images.  This issue was not 
 limited to a specific patient, workstation, or user.  The user has to 
 stop Clinical Display and restart the application and then the RGB button 
 works again.
  
 Resolution:
 The issue of application memory leak in Issue 6 above happens during the 
 separation of the color channels for 24-bit color images.  This symptom 
 of the RGB button (the color channel button) becoming inactive is related 
 to Issue 6 above (Defect 291819) and is also fixed by the modification 
 for  Issue 6. 
  
 9. Defect 410457 (Trouble Ticket R6752847FY16) Cannot Reassign Images 
 =====================================================================
 Captured to Wrong Record
 ========================
 Problem:
 This change is intended to alleviate the cumbersome process that is 
 needed now when an image is attached to the incorrect patient or 
 incorrect TIU note.
 Sites will no longer have to Print the Image, take it to the scanning 
 clerks, have the image scanned and attached to the correct patient and/or 
 correct TIU Note. 
  
 Resolution:
 A new menu item, Options | Copy Image (before Delete) for Re-Association 
 in Clinical Capture, enables users to copy an image to a local user 
 directory before the image is deleted.
  
 HIMs personnel can then use Clinical Capture to import the image from the 
 local user directory to a new patient or to the same patient and with 
 different index values.
  
 Note:  Image Groups and DICOM Study Groups cannot be copied as a Group.  
 For Image Groups (Non-DICOM), select each image for deletion from the 
 Group Abstract window, then copy each image before deletion.
  
 DICOM Study Groups need to be re-associated through the DICOM Gateway. 
  
 MUSE Interface Changes
 ======================
 Overview:  The new MUSEAPI 3 is a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) 
 based on Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). Clinical Display acts as 
 a client and 'consumes' services from the MUSE System.  The client 
 submits an Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request to the server; the 
 server returns a response to the client.
 The EKGs and other data types displayed in this viewer are MUSE generated 
 PDF images of the patient tests.  Because of these changes, the VistA 
 Imaging MUSE configuration has changed.
  
 \VistA\Imaging\MUSE Folder 
 =========================
 Previous versions of Clinical Display made use of MUSE Dyamic Link 
 Libraries (DLLs).  When Clinical Display was installed on a workstation a 
 '\Vista\Imaging\Muse' folder was created and several DLLs were installed 
 in that folder. 
 The \Vista\Imaging\Muse folder and the DLLs contained in that folder are 
 no longer used.  That folder and DLLs will be deleted in a future patch. 
  
 Network Location File (#2005.02)
 ===============================
 Physical Reference:  Previously the physical reference was the server 
 name, and 'vol000'
 Example:  \\VHAxxxMUS1\vol000\
 The interface to MUSE Systems no longer requires server name and volume.
 A Server Address and Port number are needed now.  Server address should be
 a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).  See FQDN          
 section for examples.
 The Port should be 8100 unless your site needs to use a different port.
 Example \\server address\port\
 VistA Imaging will use Port 8100 if 'vol000' is part of the Physical
 Reference.  By defaulting to 8100 this way, the current
 entries in the Network Location File should continue to work when
 MAG*3.0*167 client is installed.
 The server address should be entered in FQDN 
 notation.  The Port is configured on MUSE Systems as 8100.
  
 The Display Client will default the Port to 8100.  If your site needs to
 use a different port to communicate with the MUSE Systems.  Then you need
 to put the Port number as the Volumn.
 Example   \\ vhahunclu2a.v09.domain.ext \<port number>\
  
 Muse Version #:        
 Example current value : v7//
 This value is an entry in the MUSE VERSIONS File. 
 It was necessary in previous versions to distinguish between different
 versions of MUSE systems that will be accessed.
 Starting with MAG*3.0*167, it is no longer required to select a MUSE
 version. This field is now ignored and will be 
 deleted in a future patch.
 Note: This field is no longer used when connecting to MUSE Servers and
 will be deleted in a future patch.
  
 Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
 ==================================
 Example:  VHAHUNCLU2A.V09.DOMAIN.EXT
  
 Host Name       + Domain Name   = FQDN
 VHAxxxCLU4      Vyy.domain.ext  VHAxxxCLU4.Vyy.domain.ext
 VHAxxxIMMJB1    Vyy.domain.ext  VHAxxxIMMJB1.Vyy.domain.ext
 xxx = 3 character site code, and yy=VISN number
  
 MAG.INI Changes
 ===============
 The VistA Imaging Configuration file has changed to reflect the new VistA 
 Imaging MUSE EKG Viewer.
  
 Users with the MAG SYSTEM key can change these entries as always from the 
 System Manager menu on the Clinical Display Main window. 
  
 [VISTAMUSE] Section Entries
 ===========================
 DEBUG (FALSE)
 New entry for MAG*3.0*167.
 When TRUE, more messages are displayed in the message panel of the 
 MUSE EKG Viewer window. Also an optional Debug Window can be 
 displayed.  The Debug window will show the details of the HTTP 
 Requests and the HTTP Responses that were used in the 4 previous 
 communications with the MUSE Server.  The Debug window is primarily 
 for support personnel
  
 GRIDON (TRUE)
 This entry is no longer used; it will be removed in a future version.
 Controls if gridlines are added as a background to displayed EKGs.
  
 TEXT OVERLAYON (TRUE)
 This entry is no longer used; it will be removed in a future version.
 Determines if text overlay information is displayed.
  
 ShowDotted GridDlg (TRUE)
 This entry is no longer used; it will be removed in a future version.
 If GRIDON is TRUE, determines if gridlines are shown as solid or 
 dotted lines.
  
 PrintDottedGrid (TRUE)
 This entry is no longer used; it will be removed in a future version.
 Determines if dotted or solid gridlines are included in a printed EKG.
  
 SiteNumber (0)
 This entry is no longer used; it will be removed in a future version.
 When set to 0, the workstation will use the MUSE Site Number stored 
 in the Imaging Site Parameters File (#2006.1).
 If an individual workstation must use a site number other than the 
 one stored in #2006.1, this value can be changed as directed by 
 Customer Support.
 Background - MUSE site numbers are assigned to each facility that 
 uses the EKG database. Where multiple facilities use the same 
 database, more than one site number will be present. Each site number 
 is stored in a separate folder on the MUSE Server under the VOL000 
 share. Folders are given names starting with "Site" (i.e., Site01, 
 Site02, Site03).                      
  
 MUSE EKG Display
 ================
 The new window is a copy of the Full resolution window modified to work 
 with images that are not referenced in the IMAGE File (#2005). The 
 functionality of the toolbar buttons and the image viewer is the same as 
 in the Full Resolution Viewer.  The Images displayed in this viewer are 
 MUSE generated PDF images of the patient tests.
  
 Changes between previous EKG Display (prior to Patch 167) and the new 
 Display window:
 1.  If you are connecting to multiple MUSE Systems, the number of studies 
 from each MUSE System is displayed in this panel.  Clicking on the panel 
 will display connection information about each system. 
 2.  Click "Size" to increase/decrease the height of the list.  Click 
 "List" to show/hide the list of studies. 
 3.  The MUSE study data is displayed on the header panel of each image.  
 The overlay function is no longer available.
 4.  If the study is not confirmed, then "UNCONFIRMED" is displayed in a 
 second header panel.  The overlay of "UNCONFIRMED" is no longer available.

 be able to view this window.  Note:  Debug is always set to False when 
 Clinical Display opens.  A user with the MAG SYSTEM Key can set this 
 value to True from the System Manager menu.
 If a site is reporting issues with the MUSE EKG Display window, support 
 personnel and the Imaging Site manager can use the Debug window to 
 display the full HTTP Request and Response for the last five items.  
 Repeating the steps to reproduce the issue with the Debug window open 
 will help support personnel to find the issue.
 The top two panels are the request and response in Extensible Markup 
 Language (XML) format.

 Vista Imaging Clinical Display Client Installation Instructions
 ===============================================================
 The Clinical Imaging Display client software can be updated using one of 
 the methods outlined below:
   Manual installation
   Automatic installation using other methods (SMS, PSexec, etc.).
 Note: The Clinical Display Application is only supported on a Windows 7 
 operating system; other operating systems are not officially supported.
 Clinical Display is distributed as an MSI and EXE installation.  The MSI 
 is intended for sites that want to do a push installation (using SCCM or 
 another tool).  The EXE is intended for use to install on a single 
 workstation. 
 After client installation is complete, log in to an updated workstation 
 and use the Help | About menu option to verify that the version number is 
 3.0.167.8.
  
 Manual Installation
 ===================
 The MAG3_0P167_Clinical_Display_Setup.exe file can be installed manually 
 on workstations as described in Section "Single Workstation Installation" 
 in the VistA Imaging System Installation Guide.
  
 Auto-update Installation
 ========================
 VistA Imaging Auto-update functionality is no longer supported.
  
 Add VA Facility Subnet to MUSE ACL to Allow Communication on Port 8100
 ======================================================================
 To ensure that all the proper ports are open and that the MUSEAPI service 
 is running, users may have to add their VA facility subnet to the MUSE 
 ACL.
  
 1. Log on to the MUSE server and open services.msc. Verify that the 
 MUSEAPI3 service is installed and running. If the MUSEAPI3 service is not 
 installed GE can assist the MUSE POC.
  
 2. Log on to the MUSE server and open a cmd prompt and run netstat -a.  
 One of the returned entries should show 8100 in the local address list 
 with the state "Listening".
  
 3. Submit a ticket to have the MUSE ACL modified to allow all 
 10.xxx.xxx.xxx (i.e., 10.152.0.0 0.0.255.255) traffic on port 8100.  Each 
 site will have to have their subnet added to the MUSE ACL.
  
 Add MUSE Service Account
 ========================
 This new interface does not require or use the share.  The user 
 credentials being passed into MUSEAPI3 need to have a matching MUSE user 
 account.
   Users will need to set up a MUSEIU account on the MUSE server.  Use the 
 MUSEIU account; not the VA Service Account.
   Change the account designated in your BP Queue Processor > Network 
 Location Manager > EKG >User Name column to the new MUSEIU account user 
 name and password (i.e., MUSEIU\[MUSEIU password]).
 For more information, please see the MUSET v9 Cardiology Information 
 System Operator's Manual 2059568-009.  There is a sub-section (under
 System Settings section) on adding users to MUSE.
  
 Contact the VA Bio Medical team for help installing.  For any other 
 questions, please contact your GE representative.
  
 Uninstalling Clinical Display Client MAG*3.0*167
 ================================================
 If it is necessary to uninstall the MAG*3.0*167 client, use the Uninstall 
 option from Windows Control Panel to Uninstall: "VistA Imaging Clinical 
 Display".
 Then install the previous version of Clinical Display which was included 
 in MAG*3.0*161.
