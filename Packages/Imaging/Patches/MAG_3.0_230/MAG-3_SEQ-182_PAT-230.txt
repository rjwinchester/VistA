Subject: VISTA IMAGING EXCHANGE (VIX) INGEST SERVICES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 **Note - During Initial Operating Capability (IOC) testing, an issue was 
 found when viewing PDF files that had been converted from TIFF files.  
 When viewing the PDF files, some of the pages would be blank and a popup 
 error would display stating "Insufficient data for an image". To correct 
 this, MAG*3.0*230 replaces the .PDF conversion utility in the VIX with an 
 updated version.
  
 Because of this issue, MAG*3.0*230 is being released as an emergency 
 patch.  Sites will be required to have both the KIDS portion as well as 
 the MAG3_0P230_VIX_setup.msi installed on their site VIX servers.
  
 The Ingest service is an extension to the existing VistA Imaging Services
 Architecture (VISA) framework. It provides web services to attach
 non-DICOM images to new or existing Text Integrated Utilities (TIU) notes
 or create new TIU notes for attaching non-DICOM images related to
 consults.
  
 This functionality will be utilized by mobile applications that are 
 currently under development. In order to prepare for the use of the Ingest
 Services, the VistA sites will need to install the updated VIX.
  
 MAG*3.0*230 contains the following services and their respective 
 endpoints. The Integration Control Document (ICD) contains additional 
 information for applications wishing to integrate. Contact the VA Help
 Desk and log a ticket so that the Product Support Team can provide the
 ICD.
  
 Ingest WebApp Service
 The ingest WebApp is introduced in MAG*3.0*230 as the entry point for 
 external applications to attach images. The WebApp follows the regular 
 VIX implementation patterns.  The WebApp exposes VistA data in an 
 implementation agnostic manner allowing application developers to 
 concentrate on workflow and not VistA internals such as specific APIs, 
 RPCs, database mapping, etc.
  
 Federation Web Service
 MAG*3.0*230 makes modifications to the federation Web Services to support 
 the Ingest WebApp, the Index Term and TIU services. 
  
 Authentication Web Service
 Fetch structured security token - Fetch the security token to be used for 
 the rest of the api along with VIX security token for VIX operations. 
 This request must be made with a valid client certificate 
  
 IndexTerm Services

 command. Each corresponding command is represented by one of the four use 
 cases the extend the invoke use case.

  - getProcedureEvents
  - getProcedureEventsForSpecialties
  - getSpecialties
  - getSpecialtiesForEvents
  - getTypes
  - getTypesForClasses
  
 TIU Services
 There are many TIU Services that invoke its TIU specific command. Each 
 corresponding command is represented by one of the many use cases the
