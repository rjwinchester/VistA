 Subject:  TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION FOR CLINICAL DISPLAY
 =======
  
 Category:  OTHER
 ========
  
 Description:
 ===========
 MAG*3.0*181 provides two-factor authentication (2FA) for the Clinical 
 Display client. When the user starts Clinical Display, they will be 
 prompted for their Personal Identity Verification (PIV)/Personal 
 Identification Number (PIN) to log into Veterans Health Information 
 Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA).  In order to implement 2FA 
 for Clinical Display, the development environment was upgraded to Delphi 
 XE8. A splash screen will be displayed during startup and initialization 
 of the Display application.  The splash screen will close when the 
 application is ready to be used.  There are no other changes to 
 functionality of the Clinical Display client.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
 1. Update Clinical Display for 2FA
 ==================================
 Problem:  Per the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) mandate to 
 meet PIV requirements (VAIQ #7712300), all existing systems must be 
 upgraded to use PIV credentials for authentication.
  
 Resolution:  The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker establishes a common 
 and consistent connection for VistA client/server applications.  The 
 kernel development team has updated the RPC Broker to accept a PIV for 
 authentication in XWB*1.1*64 and RPC Broker Development Tool Kit 
 XWB*1.1*65.  The RPC Broker client component uses the Identity and Access 
 Management (IAM) SSOi Secure Token Service (STS) for Authentication.  The 
 client authenticates to IAM with PIV/PIN and obtains a Security Assertion 
 Markup Language (SAML) token; this token is associated with a VistA 
 access/verify code and is used to authenticate to VistA.
  
 Test Sites:
 ==========
 The following site is a test site for this patch:
   VA Salt Lake City Health Care System
   VA Eastern Kansas Health Care System - Topeka
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 =================================================
 Software being released and/or documentation describing the new 
 functionality introduced by this patch are available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from 
 anonymous@download.vista.domain.ext from the COMMAND prompt (example:  
 sftp anonymous@download.vista.domain.ext). This transmits the files from 
 the first available server. 
  
 Sites may also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at the following OI Field Offices:
  
 When using Attachmate Reflection (Secure Shell):
 Albany:         domain.ext
 Hines:          domain.ext
 Salt Lake City: domain.ext
