VistA Imaging Display with 2 factor authentication (2FA)
"BLD",8351,1,2,0)
This patch has 3 changes.
"BLD",8351,1,3,0)
2 small changes when the application starts, and a change to the version 
"BLD",8351,1,4,0)
of Delphi used to build the application.
"BLD",8351,1,5,0)
  
"BLD",8351,1,6,0)
This patch implements 2 Factor Authorization for the Login to VistA. 
"BLD",8351,1,7,0)
When logging into a VA Site, the user will be prompted for their
"BLD",8351,1,8,0)
PIV PIN number and not their Access Verify codes.
"BLD",8351,1,9,0)
  
"BLD",8351,1,10,0)
Also,  at start up a splash screen will be displayed.  The Splash screen
"BLD",8351,1,11,0)
will remain visible while the application is being initialized and will 
"BLD",8351,1,12,0)
close when the application is ready for use.
"BLD",8351,1,13,0)
  
"BLD",8351,1,14,0)
Delphi XE8 is the new developer environment used to build the application. 
"BLD",8351,1,15,0)
In XE8 the Character set has changed from 1 byte/character
"BLD",8351,1,16,0)
to 2 byte/character.  The change in character set forced a change in
"BLD",8351,1,17,0)
some of the functions that were used for manipulating character and 
"BLD",8351,1,18,0)
character strings.  But there will be no visible change to the GUI and
"BLD",8351,1,19,0)
the user will not see any difference in functionality.
