 Subject: VISTARAD DATE/TIMESTAMP Issue Update
 ========
  
 Category: OTHER
 =========
  
 Description:
 ============
 MAG*3.0*220 provides a VistARad Update for the display of the 
 date/timestamp associated with a study. When using VistA Imaging Capture, 
 if the user scans/captures a document to a radiology exam with a date that
 is more recent than the existing images, the timestamp display associated
 with the ordered study in VistARad disappears. Additionally, the exam to
 which the document was scanned and associated does not appear in the
 VistARad 'Custom' lists.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1. Defect 742041 (Trouble Ticket INC0129261) VistARad Date and Timestamp
 display
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 When using VistA Imaging Capture, if the user scans/captures a document 
 to a radiology exam with a date that is more recent than the existing 
 images, the timestamp associated with the ordered study in VistARad 
 disappears. Additionally, the exam to which the document was scanned and 
 associated does not appear in the VistARad 'Custom' tab. 
 When a clerk scans/captures an image, the clerk has to enter the Document 
 Image Date. This entry is only a date and does not have a time stamp. 
 VistARad loops through all the images related to an order and selects the 
 image with the earliest date that it finds in the image set. If the
 scanned/captured image is the only image related to an order, it will be 
 displayed without a timestamp.
  
 Resolution: 
 ===========
 Modified the code to use the Date/Time the image was captured, if the 
 Document Image date/time is only a date, with no time. 
  
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 The following site is a test site for this patch:
         Charles Norwood VAMC (Augusta)

 Note: To uninstall MAG*3.0*220, the "Backup a Transport Global" menu 
       option must have been selected during the Kernel Installation & 
       Distribution System (KIDS) install process (see KIDS Installation
       section above, step 4C).
 If it is necessary to uninstall MAG*3.0*220, administrators will need to 
 use the PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE. Check your MailMan 
 messages for the backup message sent by the Backup a Transport Global 
 function.

    Backup of MAG*3.0*220 install on <mmm dd, yyyy> <user name>
 2. Select the Xtract Packman option
 3. Select the Install/Check Message option
 4. Enter "Yes" at the prompt
 5. Enter "No" at the backup prompt. There is no need to backup the 
    backup.

 Routines are the only parts that are backed up. NO other parts
 are backed up, not even globals. You may use the 'Summarize Message'
 option of PackMan to see what parts the message contains.
 Those parts that are not routines should be backed up separately
 if they need to be preserved.
  
 Shall I preserve the routines on disk in a separate back-up message? 
 YES// NO
 No backup message built.
