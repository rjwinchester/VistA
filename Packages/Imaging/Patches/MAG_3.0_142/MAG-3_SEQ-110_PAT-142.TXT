Description:
============

 This document describes MAG*3.0*142, the patch that resolves the Site 
 INSTITUTION file (#4) Internal Entry Number (IEN) issue where the STATION 
 NUMBER field (#99) entry sometimes gets passed instead of the Site IEN.  
 It also repairs MAGV CREATE WORK ITEM Remote Procedure Call (RPC) errors.
  
 This patch is not compatible with MAG*3.0*138 and should not be installed at 
 sites running MAG*3.0*138.  The features and fixes of MAG*3.0*142 are 
 summarized within this document.
  
 Distribution of Software:
 =========================
  
 To obtain MAG*3.0*142 files after testing, use FTP to retrieve 
 MAG3_0P142.KID and other files from one of the following OI Field Offices' 
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directories:

 Patch 142 Changes:
 ==================
  
 This patch addresses three issues. 
  
 1) This patch fixes an issue when a Site INSTITUTION file (#4) IEN does not 
 match its STATION NUMBER (#99), resulting in errors when looking up the 
 current IMAGE NETWORK WRITE LOCATION field (#.03) in the IMAGING SITE 
 PARAMETERS file (#2006.1).
  
 2) The MAGV CREATE WORK ITEM RPC may encounter errors when non-VAMC, M&ROC, 
 RO-OC and OC entries are not screened during data validation.  
  
 3) Hybrid DICOM Gateway (HDIG) passes a Station Number to a legacy procedure 
 look up RPC instead of a SITE IEN.  
  
 Issue 1 Summary
  
 Sites are sometimes receiving an error when trying to reconcile studies 
 through DICOM Correct.  There is an issue with a Site IEN mismatch when 
 looking up the current IMAGING NETWORK WRITE LOCATION field. When calling 
 RPC "MAGVA GET CWL," Importer II is passing the STATION NUMBER field (#99) 
 value instead of the INSTITUTION file (#4)  IEN (which is incorrect).
  
 Solution 1
   
 The MAGVAG03 routine which supports the MAGVA GET CWL RPC has been modified 
 to accept either a STATION NUMBER (#99) or an INSTITUTION file (#4) IEN as 
 an input parameter when looking up the IMAGE NETWORK WRITE LOCATION field 
 (#.03) in the IMAGING SITE PARAMETERS file (#2006.1).
  
 Issue 2 Summary
   
 When an incoming exam object (image) fails a study lookup (missing or 
 incorrect patient name, accession number, etc.), typically the images will 
 be moved to a queue to be addressed for DICOM correction at a later time.  
 Instead of the images being moved to the DICOM Correct queue, the images are 
 simply rejected by the HDIG.
    
 The RPC "MAGV CREATE WORK ITEM", used by the HDIG to create entries in the 
 MAG WORK ITEM file (#2006.941), failed during the validation of the LOCATION 
 field (#4) value "501."  This field value is the INSTITUTION file (#4) IEN 
 and STATION NUMBER field (#99) value for the NEW MEXICO HCS (ALBUQUERQUE 
 VAMC). The lookup failed due to the existence of INSTITUTION file (#4) entry 
 "501st TMW CLINIC-GREENHAM COMM" - an entry that resides within other VistA 
 systems, as well.
  
 Solution 2
  
 A filter has been added to the LOCATION field (#4) of the MAG WORK ITEM file 
 (#2006.941) to filter out non-VAMC, M&ROC, RO-OC and OC entries.
  
 Issue 3 Summary
  
 Some sites are periodically unable to get the procedure search list to work.  
 Importer II was passing in the IEN instead of a station number, whereas 
 Importer I was passing in the station number.  Importer II calls RPC 
 "MAG DICOM RADIOLOGY PROCEDURES (PROC^MAGDRPCA)" instead of "MAGV GET 
 RADIOLOGY PROCEDURES (GETPROCS^MAGVIM10)."  It passes the Station Number to 
 the RPC.  This is the right value for MAGV GET RADIOLOGY PROCEDURES 
 (GETPROCS^MAGVIM10).  However, since it is calling the wrong RPC, one that 
 expects the Site IEN, it fails. 
  
 Solution 3 
    
 The code was modified to call the correct RPC MAGV GET RADIOLOGY PROCEDURES 
 (GETPROCS^MAGVIM10).  This release will allow sites with IENs and Station 
 Numbers that do not match to use the new Importer without error during the 
 procedure lookup.  The affected sites will no longer have to revert to using 
 the legacy Importer.

 Installation
 ============
   
 Installation Planning
 =====================
  
 MAG*3.0*142 is to be installed on the VistA System.  This patch must be 
 installed by the compliance date to conform to the VHA Directive 2001-023.
  
 Note:  All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of 
 this patch. 
  
 Installation for the KIDS will take approximately two minutes.  
  
 Installation Prerequisites
 ==========================
   
 Before installing this patch, you will need to download the MAG*3.0*142 files 
 from one of the OI Field Offices FTP servers. Verify that the patches listed 
 in the section Associated Patches on Page 2 have been installed.   
  
 Note:  All released VistA Imaging patches must be installed on the VistA 
 system before installing Patch 142.  
  
 Note:  This patch is not compatible with MAG*3.0*138 and should not be 
 installed at sites running MAG*3.0*138.  VistA System (KIDS) Installation 
  
 Installing the VistA system (KIDS) involves installing the file 
 MAG3_0P142.KID on the VistA system.
  
 Before installing the file, all released patches, including the patches 
 listed in the Associated Patches section of this document, must be installed 
 (i.e., MAG*3.0*118).  Please verify with your VistA Imaging coordinator or 
 VistA Administrator.
  
 Note:  This patch is not compatible with MAG*3.0*138 and should not be 
 installed at sites running MAG*3.0*138.
  
 Installation Steps
 ==================
  
 1. Access the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu [XPD MAIN].
 2. Run the Installation option [XPD INSTALLATION MENU].
 3. Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
    a. Run the #1 Load a Distribution [XPD LOAD DISTRIBUTION] option to load 
       the KIDS distribution.
    b. When prompted, enter the path and file name (MAG3_0P142.KID) of the 
       MAG*3.0*142 KIDS file that you downloaded from the Imaging FTP server.
    c. When prompted to continue with the load, enter "YES."  A message will 
       be displayed when the load is complete.
 4.  After loading the KIDS file, use the following options to verify the 
     contents of the patch.  This is a good time to back up any affected 
     routines.
    a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global [XPD PRINT CHECKSUM] - Run this 
       option if you want to ensure the integrity of the routines in the patch.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARETO SYSTEM] - Run
       this option if you want to view all changes that will be made when the 
       patch is installed. All components (routines, options, and so on) in 
       the patch will be compared.
    c. Back up a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] - Run this option if you want to 
       create a backup message of any routines exported with the patch. The 
       option will NOT back up any of the other changes.
 5. After performing the load and any optional verification steps, install the 
    KIDS file by performing the following steps:
    a. Run the Install Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option.
    b. When prompted for the install name, enter MAG*3.0*142.
    c. Answer "NO" to the following prompts, if they appear:

 Installation & Distribution System" menu option:  "Backup a Transport Global" 
 (see installation section above, step 4c) before you installed the patch. 
  
 If it is necessary to uninstall MAG*3.0*142, administrators will need to use 
 the Packman function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE.  Check your MailMan messages for 
 the backup message sent by the Backup a Transport Global function.
  
 1.  Select the message shown below:

 Warning:  Installing this message will cause a permanent update of globals
 and routines.
 Do you really want to do this? NO// YES
  
 Routines are the only parts that are backed up.  NO other parts
 are backed up, not even globals.  You may use the 'Summarize Message'
 option of PackMan to see what parts the message contains.
 Those parts that are not routines should be backed up separately
 if they need to be preserved.
  
 Shall I preserve the routines on disk in a separate back-up message? YES// NO
 No backup message built.
