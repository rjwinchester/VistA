Description:
============

 The VA has a variety of commercial departmental imaging systems: Picture 
 Archiving and Communication System (PACS) in Radiology and Cardiology, 
 imaging systems in clinical specialties like Eye Care, Endoscopy, and 
 Dentistry, and Digital Pathology System (DPS) in Anatomic Pathology.  All 
 of these systems are interfaced to VistA Imaging to receive study order 
 information via HL7 messages and to send DICOM images back to VistA for 
 long term storage.
  
 In order to operate properly, it is crucial that the departmental imaging
 systems keep patient demographics (name, birthdate, patient identifier,
 gender, etc.) in sync with the local VistA database.  If a name change
 occurs on VistA and is not communicated to the departmental imaging
 system, then order processing is delayed at the departmental imaging
 system because of the name mismatch.
  
 Subsequently, when the images with the old name sent are back to VistA,
 processing is delayed because of the name mismatch.  Manual procedures are
 then required to resolve these issues.  These manual procedures are
 inefficient and slow, interrupt patient care, and are error prone.  Not 
 communicating patient demographic changes on VistA to the departmental 
 imaging systems can be a major patient safety issue (see patient safety 
 PSPO(s) #3115, & #3428).
  
 The goal of this patch is to have local VistA send HL7 patient demographic
 update messages to the departmental imaging systems.  This is accomplished
 by using the ADT A08 Patient Information Update and ADT A47 Change Patient
 Identifier List messages.  This follows the established practice in the
 industry. The Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) Technical
 Framework documents the use of the ADT A08 message to communicate patient
 demographic updates from an ADT system (VistA PIMS) to a departmental 
 imaging system:
  
   The Update Patient transaction is an HL7 ADT message. The message shall 
   be generated by the system that performs the update whenever an error is
   resolved or a change occurs in patient demographics.
  
   An A08 message is the only method that may be used to update patient 
   demographic and visit information. However Patient ID cannot be updated 
   with an A08 message.
   
   It is expected that after receiving Patient Information Update message 
   (A08) the receiving system will update its local patient demographic, 
   visit, allergy, and/or insurance information. Any information received
   as null in the new A08 message shall be removed locally.
  
 The IHE also documents the use of the ADT A47 to change patient 
 identifier information:
  
   The Patient Demographics Supplier notifies the change of a patient 
   identifier list for a patient. That is, a single PID-3-patient
   identifier list value has been found to be incorrect and has been
   changed.
  
   This message is not used to update other patient demographics
   information.
  
   The receiver shall correct the identifier in its database, and shall 
   report the result of this operation (success / error) in an 
   acknowledgment message returned to the sender. 
  
 The IHE specified these two transactions many years ago and has tested 
 them with PACS at international Connectathons for more than a decade. 
  
 This patch will enable VistA Imaging to send real-time ADT A08 and ADT 
 A47 HL7 messages to the departmental imaging systems so that they can 
 automatically update their patient information.  This will eliminate the 
 problems caused by the lack of communications of patient demographic 
 changes.  Departmental imaging systems will automatically be able to keep 
 patient demographics in sync with the local VistA system.  Problems 
 caused by patient name changes will be virtually eliminated and a major 
 patient safety concern will be resolved.

 Patch Installation:
 ===================
  
 Installation Planning
 ---------------------
 MAG*3.0*183 must be installed on the VistA System and on legacy VistA 
 Imaging DICOM Gateways. This patch must be installed by the compliance 
 date to conform to VHA Directive 2001-023.
  
 All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of this 
 patch.  This patch can be loaded while the VistA Imaging System is active 
 and users are on the system.  Installing the MAG*3.0*183 KIDS takes 2-5 
 minutes.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------ 
 Verify that the patches listed in the Associated Patches section of this 
 document have been previously installed.
  
 Note:  All released VistA Imaging patches must be installed on the VistA 
 system before installing MAG*3.0*183.
  
 VistA System (KIDS) Installation
 -------------------------------- 
 - Installation Steps 
 The actual KIDS installation will take less than one minute.
  
 1) On the VistA system, access the Kernel Installation and 
    Distribution System Menu [XPD MAIN].
 2) Run the Installation option [XPD INSTALLATION MENU].
 3) Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
    a. Run the Load a Distribution option [XPD LOAD DISTRIBUTION] to 
       load the KIDS distribution.
    b. When prompted, enter the path and file name (MAG3_0P183.KID) of 
       the Patch 183 KIDS file.
    c. When prompted to continue with the load, enter "YES". A 
       Distribution OK! message will be displayed when the load is
       complete.
 4) After loading the KIDS file, use the following options to verify 
    the contents of the patch and to back up any affected routines.
    a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global [XPD PRINT CHECKSUM] - Run 
       this option if you want to ensure the integrity of the routines in
       the patch.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE TO 
       SYSTEM] - Run this option if you want to view all changes that will
       be made when the patch is installed.  All components (routines,
       options, and so on) in the patch will be compared.
    c. Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] - Run this option if you
       want to create a backup message of any routines exported with the
       patch. It will NOT back up any of the other changes
 5) After performing the load and any optional verification steps, 
    install the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
    a. Run the Install Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option.
    b. When prompted for the install name, enter "MAG*3.0*183".
    c. Answer "NO" to the following prompts:
  
  Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO//
  Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//
  Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO//
  
 6) When installation is finished, an Install Complete message will 
    be displayed.

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy
 ==========================
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch. It is imperative that you have performed 
 a backup of the VistA routines included in this patch prior to 
 installation.  (The VistA routines are listed below.)
  
 The back-out plan for VistA is to restore the routines from this backup.  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the routine information below.
  
 There is a new Imaging subscriber to PROTOCOL file (#101)  VAFC ADT-A08 
 SERVER.  The MAGD PACS VAFC ADT-A08 CLIENT subscriber protocol should be 
 removed.
  
 There were two changes to the FileMan Data Dictionary for the IMAGING 
 SITE PARAMETERS file (#2006.1),  SEND ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY HL7field (#204) 
 and ENABLE TELEPATH WORKLIST field (#205).  These are minor changes to 
 the names and descriptions and do not require changing back.  Similarly, 
 there were changes to descriptions in 18 protocol files and six new ones 
 created.  These are listed above in the Protocols Associated section and 
 do not need to be removed.
  
 The back-out plan for the DICOM Gateway is to uninstall MAG*3.0*183 and 
 install the previous version (MAG*3.0*166).
