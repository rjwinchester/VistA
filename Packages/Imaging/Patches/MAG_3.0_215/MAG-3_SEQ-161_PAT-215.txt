 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview
 ===========================================
 1. Defect 719991 (Trouble Ticket # I18428273FY18/INC1567928) Issue with
 Clinical Procedures Visits
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 When the user selects "Clinical Procedures Requests" and then selects a
 visit from the "Visit listing" screen by using the left mouse, the system
 displays the following error: "Cannot focus a disabled or invisible
 window". If users select a visit by clicking the right mouse key, the
 system does not throw any error message.
  
 Resolution: 
 ===========
 The defect was fixed by updating the code to check the ListView component 
 used to display the visits list before attempting to display the Visits 
 screen for a proper handle.  If the ListView does not have a proper handle
 the code change will allocate a valid handle to the ListView, then the 
 Visits screen will be displayed.
