Subject: Telnet to SSH

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

  
  
 Description:
 ============
 MAG*3.0*176 replaces the Telnet connection to the Digital Imaging and 
 Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Gateway with a Secure Shell (SSH) 
 connection using Micro Focus Reflection.
  
 This SSH implementation of Attachmate (Micro Focus) Reflection will not 
 be used for direct user access to the Legacy DICOM Gateway.  If it is 
 necessary to move images, sites may use the following methods: 
 a. On demand routing using VistARad for Radiology images
 b. The ROI capability in Clinical Display
 c. Remote Desktop to the Gateway to use the option locally

 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ==================================================
 Software being released and/or documentation describing the new 
 functionality introduced by this patch is available.

 Sites may also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directory at the following OI Field Offices:
  
 When using Attachmate Reflection (Secure Shell):
 Albany:         domain.ext
 Hines:          domain.ext
 Salt Lake City: domain.ext
  
 When using the COMMAND prompt (example: sftp 
 anonymous@domain.ext):
