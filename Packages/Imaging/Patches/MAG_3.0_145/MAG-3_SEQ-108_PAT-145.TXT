 Remedy Calls:
 =============
  
 The following Remedy help desk calls are addressed in this patch:
  
 INC000000929813          The AE Title Interface allows users to enter new institutions into the Institution (# 4) file regardless of the user privileges. Sites that inadvertently entered new institution entries while creating remote AE Title ent
 ries were unable to use the new Hybrid DICOM Image Gateway (HDIG) for operations that interacted with VistA.
  
 INC000000925964          The AE Title RPC selects the first entry in the AE Title file that contains a matching Remote AE Title name. Many sites contain multiple entries with the same Remote AE Title name.
  
 NSRs:
 =====
  
 There are no National Service Requests (NSRs) addressed in this patch. 
  
 Patch 145 Changes
  
 MAG*3.0*145 is required as an initial step towards making VistA Imaging the Level 2 archive for all images. This patch provides the enhancements described in this section.
 Specific Changes
           The ability to add a new institution has been removed at the site prompt in the AE Title User Interface. The user may now only select existing entries in the INSTITUTION (#4) file. A data dictionary field entry was modified to implemen
 t the fix. No routines were modified. The only change the user will encounter is that the user can no longer enter new INSTITUTION (#4) file entries from the AE Title User Interface.
           The MAGV GET REMOTE AE Title RPC was modified to select the first entry with a matching Remote AE Title and a station number. The addition of station number matching will allow sites to have multiple entries with the same AE Title. The
  end user reported the problem, but did not suggest a solution. A single routine was modified to implement the fix. There were no data changes. The change is transparent to the user.
