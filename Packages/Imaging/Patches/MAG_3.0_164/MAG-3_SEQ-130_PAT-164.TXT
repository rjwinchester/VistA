 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1. Defect 391628 (Ticket I10555403FY16)  Error when Selecting Ordering
 ======================================================================
 Location
 ========
 Problem:  When selecting an ordering location at a Community-based 
 Outpatient Clinic (CBOC), sites are receiving the error:  "The selected 
 ordering location does not have any procedures.  Please select another 
 imaging location or have an administrator add procedures for the 
 location."  Sites are filtered out if they are not designated as Veterans 
 Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), Medical and Regional Office Center 
 (M&ROC), Regional Office Outpatient Clinic (RO-OC), or Outpatient Clinic 
 (OC) in the Institution file.
  
 Resolution:  The Station Number was converted to an IEN in line with 
 Integration Agreement (IA)# 2171.
  
 2. Defect 391632  Inactive Locations Included
 =============================================
 Problem:  The "MAGV GET RAD IMAGING LOCATIONS" Remote Procedure Call 
 (RPC) returns ALL imaging location entries, including inactive 
 locations.  If the Importer user unknowingly chooses an inactive 
 location, their exam will be rejected at the time the HDIG attempts to 
 complete the import transaction.
  
 Resolution:  A filter was included in which the "MAGV GET RAD IMAGING 
 LOCATIONS" RPC returns only active imaging locations.
  
 Test Sites:
 ==========
 The following sites are test sites for this patch:
   Phoenix VA Healthcare System
   Fayetteville VAMC (NC)
   Biloxi VAMC
   Sioux Falls VA Health Care System
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 =================================================
 Software being released and/or documentation describing the new 
 functionality introduced by this patch are available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from 
 anonymous@download.vista.domain.ext from the COMMAND prompt (example:  
 sftp anonymous@download.vista.domain.ext). This transmits the files from 
 the first available server. 
  
 Sites may also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at the following OI Field Offices:
  
 When using Attachmate Reflection (Secure Shell):
 Albany:         domain.ext
 Hines:          domain.ext
 Salt Lake City: domain.ext

 Routines are the only parts that are backed up.  NO other parts
 are backed up, not even globals.  You may use the 'Summarize Message'
 option of PackMan to see what parts the message contains.
 Those parts that are not routines should be backed up separately
 if they need to be preserved.
  
 Shall I preserve the routines on disk in a separate back-up message? 
 YES// NO
 No backup message built.
