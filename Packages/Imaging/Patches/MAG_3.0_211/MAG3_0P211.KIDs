VistA Imaging Capture 211
"BLD",8376,1,2,0)
This patch fixes 2 issues.
"BLD",8376,1,3,0)
First:  when trying to Batch Capture multiple images,
"BLD",8376,1,4,0)
sometimes an error will occur when the application is processing
"BLD",8376,1,5,0)
single page PDF files.  The PDF file will not be captured, and not
"BLD",8376,1,6,0)
included in the Image Group.
"BLD",8376,1,7,0)
Second: When Closing the Capture application, sometimes an error
"BLD",8376,1,8,0)
will occur, and the application will not close.  The user must
"BLD",8376,1,9,0)
use Taskmanager to 'kill' the application.
"BLD",8376,1,10,0)
This error occurs when trying to remove all images from the 
"BLD",8376,1,11,0)
user's \temp folder when the user does not have permission to
"BLD",8376,1,12,0)
delete from that folder.
