 Subject: CLINICAL CAPTURE ISSUE
 ========
  
 Category: ROUNTINE
 =========
  
 Description:
 ============
 MAG*3.0*211 resolves two issues for the Clinical Capture Client. First,
 there is an issue with the single page color PDF images. When the user 
 performs batch capture of single page color pdf image, the system throws 
 an error message that the image had issues loading. This issue happens 
 only when users save it on a desktop or upload the image from their local 
 drive. When the user uploads the single page pdf from VistA 
 Imaging/network drive, the issue will not occur. Some image(s) will need 
 to be edited, so the user needs to save the image locally or on a desktop.
 If the user does not use batch capture, there is a chance of creating
 duplicate uploads. 
  
 The second issue occurs when some users delete temporary files. This error
 causes the Capture application to freeze.  The user must open Task
 Manager, and use the 'End Task' function to close the application.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1. Defect 679299 (Trouble Ticket # I15923209FY17) Issue with Batch 
 Capture
 Problem: 
 ========
 When the user performs batch capture of a single page color pdf image, the
 system throws an error message that the image had issues loading. This
 issue happens only when users save it on a desktop or upload from their
 local drive. When the user uploads the single page color pdf from VistA
 Imaging/network drive, the issue will not occur. Some images need to be
 edited, so the user needs to save the image locally or on a desktop. If
 the user does not use batch capture, there is a chance of creating
 duplicate uploads. 
 The problem with selecting the documents from the Vista Imaging Network 
 Drive is that the documents cannot be edited. When scanning in a document 
 with multiple pages, for instance, and one page is sideways or needs to 
 be deleted, it turns all pages, not just the one selected and the page 
 cannot be deleted. In other words, when scanned into the desktop folder, 
 the images can be edited using Adobe Acrobat.
  
 Resolution: 
 ===========
 The Batch Capture function was modified. The function now clears the 
 ImageGear control that had previously opened the PDF file. This action
 clears the handle to the temporary image, allowing it to be deleted by the
 application in the process of capturing the image to the image network
 location.
  
 2. Defect 737628 (Trouble Ticket # I18701954FY18) Indian Health 
 Service(IHS): File Access denied error when Clinical Capture is closed
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 On Clinical Capture when a user closes or exits Clinical Capture, the
 system throws the File Access denied error. In certain situations, an
 error occurs in the Clinical Capture application when temporary files are 
 deleted. This error causes the Capture application to freeze.  The user 
 must open Task Manager, and use the 'End Task' function to close the 
 application. 
  
 Resolution: 
 ===========
 The application was modified to catch any exception that occurs due to 
 file access denied. Now when the application closes, any exception is 
 'caught' and the capture application closes cleanly.
  
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 The following sites are test sites for this patch:
    Northern Arizona VA Health Care System
