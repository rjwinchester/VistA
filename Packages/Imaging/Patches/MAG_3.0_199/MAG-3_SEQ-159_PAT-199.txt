 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview
 ============================================
 1. Defect 607235 (CA Ticket I16396441FY17) VistARad Update for Monitored
 Sites
  
 Problem:  
 ========
 After the VistARad Patch MAG*3.0*184( 2-Factor Authentication (2FA)) was 
 installed at the sites, the user was not able to login to the Monitored 
 Sites. The user is receiving an error, when the user select "Monitored 
 Sites" and  try to log into the sites by selecting "Login" using the 2FA 
 credentials or entering Access/Verify code. VistARad will crash or the 
 user receives an error message stating other applications may not be able 
 to join the context.    The user will have to close VistARAD or relaunch 
 the VistARad Application.  This issue will not allow the users to login 
 into Monitored Sites; therefore users cannot see the workload of exams 
 that are assigned. This issue is dependent on Vergence/ Clinical Context 
 Object Workgroup (CCOW)/ Locator Service running or not running.
  
 Resolution:  
 ===========
 The code has been updated  so the Monitored Sites login process will be 
 streamlined so there is no need to re-enter PIV PIN codes. In the
 background, the current VistARad instance gets closed and new VistARad 
 instance opens connecting to the selected Monitored Site.
 During, relaunch, the current VistARad instance is not closed and hence 
 the new instance is not able to open giving the message that application 
 is timed out. Code is updated to increase the timeout value and the 
 timeout value is placed in the configuration file. Now, when the user 
 gets the timeout message, user can increase the timeout value in the 
 configuration file and use the application.
  
 Note: The user will need to close any currently opened exams; VistARad 
 will prompt you if this is necessary. 
  
 Test Sites
 ===========
 The following site is a test site for this patch:

 *A test waiver has been approved to allow for testing to proceed with one 
 site.
