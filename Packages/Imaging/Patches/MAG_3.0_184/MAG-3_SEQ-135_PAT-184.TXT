 Subject:  TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION FOR VISTARAD
 =======
  
 Category:  OTHER
 ========
  
 Description:
 ===========
 MAG*3.0*184 provides two-factor authentication (2FA) for VistARad. When 
 the user starts VistARad, they will be prompted for their Personal 
 Identity Verification (PIV)/Personal Identification Number (PIN) to log 
 into Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture 
 (VistA).  If the user cancels, they will be prompted for the 
 access/verify code.  A splash screen will be displayed during startup and 
 initialization of the VistARad application.  The splash screen will close 
 when the application is ready to be used.  There are no other changes to 
 functionality of VistARad.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
 1. Update VistARad for 2FA
 ===============================
 Problem:  Per the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) mandate to 
 meet PIV requirements (VAIQ #7712300), all existing systems must be 
 upgraded to use PIV credentials for authentication.
  
 Resolution:  The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker establishes a common 
 and consistent connection for VistA client/server applications.  The 
 kernel development team has updated the RPC Broker to accept a PIV for 
 authentication in XWB*1.1*64 and RPC Broker Development Tool Kit 
 XWB*1.1*65.  The RPC Broker client component uses the Identity and Access 
 Management (IAM) SSOi Secure Token Service (STS) for Authentication.  The 
 client authenticates to IAM with PIV/PIN and obtains a Security Assertion 
 Markup Language (SAML) token; this token is associated with a VistA 
 access/verify code and is used to authenticate to VistA.
  
 Test Sites:
 ==========
 The following site is a test site for this patch:
   Fayetteville VAMC (NC)
  
 *A test waiver has been approved to allow for testing to proceed with one 
 site.
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 =================================================
 Software being released and/or documentation describing the new 
 functionality introduced by this patch are available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from 
 anonymous@download.vista.domain.ext from the COMMAND prompt (example:  
 sftp anonymous@download.vista.domain.ext). This transmits the files from 
 the first available server. 
  
 Sites may also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directory at the following OI Field Offices:
  
 When using Attachmate Reflection (Secure Shell):
 Albany:         domain.ext
 Hines:          domain.ext
 Salt Lake City: domain.ext
  
 When using the COMMAND prompt (example: sftp 
 anonymous@domain.ext): 
 Albany:         anonymous@domain.ext
 Hines:          anonymous@domain.ext
 Salt Lake City: anonymous@domain.ext
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at  http://www4.domain.ext/vdl/ (or at 
 https://www.domain.ext/vdl/application.asp?appid=105 for Imaging).

 VistARad Client Installation Instructions
 =========================================
 The following steps can be used to install an existing VistARad 
 workstation.  Installation should take two to three minutes.
  
 Note:  
 ====
 If a version of VistARad older than MAG*3.0*120 is installed, use 
 Add/Remove Programs in the Windows Control Panel to remove VistARad 
 before using the steps below.
  
 Note:  
 ====
 New 2FA updates require that Internet Explorer (IE) 11 be installed and 
 that PIV authentication be used  to log in. Since, in some cases, the 
 VRAD diagnostic workstation could be on a VLAN (isolated private 
 network), the IE 11 version is now required.  There are six pre-req KBs 
 of Microsoft IE11 that will need to be installed. The following Microsoft 
 link provides information to acquire both 32 and 64 bit versions of IE 
 11.  
 https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2847882/prerequisite-updates-for-
 internet-explorer-11
 Once installed, it will enable installation of IE 11 with the offline 
 installer.
  
 1. Log in to the workstation as an administrator, and ensure that no 
 other programs are running. 
 2. Initiate the installation:
 Windows 7:  Right-click on the MAG3_0P184_VistARad_Setup.exe, and select 
 the Run as Administrator option to start the installation wizard.
 3. After the setup launches
   a. You may be prompted to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 
 Redistributable Package.  Click "Install" to complete this step.
   b. There will be a brief delay as the VistARad installation files are 
 extracted.
  
 Note:  
 ====
 There are no configurable installation options.  VistARad will be 
 installed in:  Windows 7: C:\Program Files (x86) 
 \VistA\Imaging\MAG_VistARad.
  
 4. When the Welcome page appears, click "Next".
 5. When the Ready to Install page displays, click "Install".
 6. Installation of MAG*3.0*184 starts automatically.  After installation 
 is complete, click "Finish" to exit the wizard.
 7. You may be prompted to re-start your workstation in order for the 
 configuration changes to take effect.  Click "Yes" to complete this step.
 8. Use the VistARad shortcut on the desktop or in the Windows Start 
 menu (Start | Programs | VistA Imaging Programs | MAG_VistARad_Patch184) 
 to start VistARad.
 9. From the Help | About menu, verify that the software client 
 version is 3.0.184.1.
