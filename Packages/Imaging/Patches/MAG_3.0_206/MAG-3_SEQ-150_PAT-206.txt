 Subject:  TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION FOR IMPORTER
 ========
 Category:  OTHER
 =========
 Description:
 ============
 MAG*3.0*206 provides two-factor authentication (2FA) for Importer. When
 the user starts the Importer application, they will be prompted for their 
 Personal Identity Verification (PIV)/Personal Identification Number (PIN) 
 to log into Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology 
 Architecture (VistA). A splash screen will be displayed during startup 
 and initialization of the Importer application.  The splash screen will 
 close when the application is ready to be used.  There are no other
 changes to functionality of Importer.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1.   Update Importer with 2FA
 Problem:  Per a VA mandate, all existing systems must be upgraded to use 
 PIV credentials for authentication.
  
 Resolution:  The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker establishes a common 
 and consistent connection for VistA client/server applications.  The 
 kernel development team has updated the RPC Broker to accept a PIV for 
 authentication in XWB*1.1*64 and RPC Broker Development Tool Kit 
 XWB*1.1*65.  The RPC Broker client component uses the IAM SSOi Secure 
 Token Service (STS) for Authentication.  The client authenticates to IAM 
 with PIV/PIN and obtains an SAML token; this token is associated with a 
 VistA access/verify code and is used to authenticate to VistA.
  
 The Importer will be updated to prompt users for PIV/PIN which, upon 
 success, will provide the SAML token.  This SAML token will be passed 
 over to the VIX application through a restful service call which will 
 then authenticate the user in VistA.
  
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 The following sites are test sites for this patch:
         VA Southern Nevada HCS (Las Vegas)
  
 *A test waiver has been approved to allow for testing to proceed with one 
 site.
 * The IOC testing was completed in MAG*3.0*179(Cancelled Patch). 
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ==================================================
 Software being released and/or documentation describing the new 
 functionality introduced by this patch are available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext. 
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may also 
 elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directory at the following OI Field Offices:
  
 Hines:          domain.ext  
 Salt Lake City: domain.ext
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at:
 http://www4.domain.ext/vdl/.
  
  
  
 Patch Installation:
 ===================
 Supported Client Versions
 =========================
 When MAG*3.0*206 is released, the list of supported versions of Importer 
 will change:
  
 Importer
 Supported Versions      No Longer Supported 
 3.0.206                 3.0.118
 3.0.136
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ===============================
 MAG*3.0*206 must be installed on the VistA System.  This patch must be 
 installed by the compliance date.
  
 All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of this 
 patch.  This patch can be loaded while the VistA Imaging System is active 
 and users are on the system.  Installing the MAG*3.0*206 KIDS only takes 
 2-3 minutes.
  
 Windows Registry
 ================
 With the addition of the RPC Broker as part of the 2FA effort, Importer 
 will now rely on VistA server information available in the Windows 
 Registry for each client computer that installs the Importer 
 application.  This registry setting is a requirement of the RPC Broker 
 and some other VistA client applications; it is possible that the 
 settings already exist on a client computer, however it should be 
 confirmed before installing Importer.  As mentioned above, the following 
 may require support from local site administrators.
  
 Open the Registry Editor and browse to the 
 \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node key.  If a "Vista" key exists, 
 expand it, if not create it.  If a "Broker" key exists, expand it, if not 
 create it.  If a "Servers" key exists, expand it, if not create it so
 that the full path is:
 \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE,Wow6432Node\Vista\Broker\Servers
 Within this key, one (or more) String values are required.  The name of 
 Registry String should contain the IP address or Fully Qualified Domain 
 Name (FQDN) of the VistA server, a comma, and then the port number that 
 will accept remote connections. 
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ==============================
 Verify that the patches listed in the Associated Patches section of this 
 document have been previously installed.
  
 Note:  All released VistA Imaging patches must be installed on the VistA 
 system before installing MAG*3.0*206.
  
 Prerequisite:  Before installing the P206 KIDS package, all users who 
 access the Importer application must be assigned the secondary menu 
 option called "MAGTP WORKLIST MGR" in VistA.  This is required because 
 currently the REMOTE APPLICATION file has no entry available for the 
 Importer application.  This is a temporary work around until there is an 
 entry created for the Importer application via a patch release.
  
 VistA System (KIDS) Installation Instructions
 =============================================
 Installation Steps 
 ===================
 KIDS installation will take less than one minute.
 1 On the VistA system, access the Kernel Installation and 
 Distribution System Menu [XPD MAIN].
 2 Run the Installation option [XPD INSTALLATION MENU].
 3 Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
  a. Run the Load a Distribution option [XPD LOAD DISTRIBUTION] to 
 load the KIDS distribution.
  b. When prompted, enter the path and file name (MAG3_0P206.KID) of 
 the MAG*3.0*206 KIDS file.
  c. When prompted to continue with the load, enter "YES". A 
 Distribution OK! message will be displayed when the load is complete.
 4 After loading the KIDS file, use the following options to verify 
 the contents of the patch and to back up any affected routines.
  a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global [XPD PRINT CHECKSUM] - Run 
 this option if you want to ensure the integrity of the routines in the 
 patch. 
  b. Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE TO 
 SYSTEM] - Run this option if you want to view all changes that will be 
 made when the patch is installed.  All components (routines, options, and 
 so on) in the patch will be compared.
  c. Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] - Run this option if you 
 want to create a backup message of any routines exported with the patch.  
 It will NOT back up any of the other changes.
 5 After performing the load and any optional verification steps, 
 install the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
  a. Run the Install Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option.
  b. When prompted for the install name, enter "MAG*3.0*206".
  c. Answer "NO" to the following prompts, if they appear:
