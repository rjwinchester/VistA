 Subject:  VISTARAD MAINTENANCE X
 =======
  
 Category:  OTHER
 ========
  
 Description:
 ===========
 This patch addresses several VistARad problems reported by the sites. 
 When a study has multiple image series and only one of them is shown in 
 the viewer window at load time, an attempt to visualize another image 
 series from the study may produce an unsorted sequence of images. If a 
 study has the total image size of about 2.8GB, VistARad fails to load it 
 on Windows 7 x64, even though it has access to 4GB of address space on 
 this platform.  On certain images, measurements or annotations created 
 using VistARad will disappear if the mouse buttons are not held down.  
 Also, the elliptical tool is displaying erroneous information when using 
 the Hounsfield unit option.
  
 Note:  All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion 
 of this patch.  At sites that have implemented VistARad, installation of 
 both the KIDS and the client software is required. The MAG*3.0*153 KIDS 
 is backward compatible with the MAG*3.0*152, MAG*3.0*133 and the 
 MAG*3.0*120 client software.  Installation of the client software may be 
 phased in according to each site's needs.

 New Service Requests (NSRs):
 ===========================
 There are no new service requests addressed in this patch.
  
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 ============================
 Issue 4 below (the elliptical tool sometimes displays erroneous 
 information when using the Hounsfield unit option) is a potential PSI 
 (PSPO00003163). 
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 1.  Remedy Ticket INC000000622962 (Defect 194689): Pet CTs not Displaying 
 in Correct Order
 ==========================================================================
 Problem:
 It is not unusual for study images to be subdivided into separate 
 series.  This is often done according to image modality types.  For 
 example, a Computed Tomography (CT)/Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 
 scan may have a CT image series and a PET image series.  If the current 
 hanging protocol loads only one image series, the user may want to 
 visualize a second image series by manually placing it in a viewer 
 window.  In this case, the images may appear in the order different from 
 the sorting order of the hanging protocol.  This happens because image 
 series are sorted only at load time.
  
 Resolution:
 The code was modified so that the image series are also sorted when they 
 are placed in the viewer window.
  
 2.  Remedy Ticket INC000000993396 (Defect 194688) :Only First Image of 
 Fluoroscopy Study is Viewable
 ==========================================================================
 Problem:
 When VistARad detects that a study is too big to fit into available 
 memory, it prompts the user to split it into separate image stacks that 
 can be loaded and purged separately.  This functionality, however, does 
 not work for studies with multi-frame images.
  
 Resolution:
 Code was modified to update the assessment of available memory to produce 
 a better approximation of its size.
  
 3.  CA Service Desk Manager (SDM) Ticket I6975956FY16 (Defect 277979): 
 VistARad Measurements Disappear
 ==========================================================================
 Problem:
 When images with Group 6000 overlays are viewed in VistARad, measurements 
 or annotations created using VistARad will disappear if the mouse buttons 
 are not held down.
  
 Resolution:
 The problem happened because of a conflict between annotation rendering 
 and new overlay functionality.  Overlays were disabled and enabled as the 
 user interacted with the program.  This affected the way annotations and 
 measurements were rendered.  The code was modified to synchronize the 
 rendering order of the overlays, annotations, and measurements.
  
 4.  Remedy Ticket INC000001226929 (Defect:  294798): Elliptical Tool 
 Displaying Erroneous Information when Using Hounsfield Unit Option
 ==========================================================================
 Problem:
 On rare occasions, CT scanners are displaying values that are out of 
 range for average values (AVs) and standard deviations (SDs).  There can 
 be an erroneous reading when measuring small objects, typically 
 surrounded by tissue of a much different density, when using the 
 elliptical tool for selecting the Region of Interest (ROI) for the 
 Hounsfield unit option.
  
 Resolution:
 The code was modified to remove the elliptical tool for the Hounsfield 
 unit option.

 VistARad Client Installation
 The following steps can be used to install VistARad for the first time or 
 to update a workstation that is running VistARad MAG*3.0*120, MAG*3.0*133 
 or MAG*3.0*152 to VistARad MAG*3.0*153.  Installation should take two to 
 three minutes.
 Note:  If a version of VistARad older than MAG*3.0*120 is installed, use 
 Add/Remove Programs in the Windows Control Panel to remove VistARad 
 before using the steps below.
  
 1. Log in to the workstation as an administrator, and ensure that no 
 other programs are running. 
 2. Initiate the installation:
 Windows 7:  Right-click on the MAG3_0P153_VistARad_Setup.exe, and select 
 the Run as Administrator option to start the installation wizard.
 3. After the setup launches
   a. You may be prompted to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 
 Redistributable Package.  Click "Install" to complete this step.
   b. There will be a brief delay as the VistARad installation files are 
 extracted.
 Note:  There are no configurable installation options.  VistARad will be 
 installed in:  Windows 7: C:\Program Files (x86) 
 \VistA\Imaging\MAG_VistARad.
 4. When the Welcome page appears, click "Next".
 5. When the Ready to Install page displays, click "Install".
 6. Installation of MAG*3.0*153 starts automatically.  After installation 
 is complete, click "Finish" to exit the wizard.
