Subject: CLINICAL PROCEDURE AND DICOM CONSULT REQUEST TRACKING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patches MAG*3.0*208 and MD*1.0*60 work together and should be installed 
 back to back. The two patches improve interoperability for the Clinical
 Procedures DICOM modalities by using the VistA Imaging accession number
 ("sss-GMR-nnnnnnnn") as the CP Instrument Order Number.  This allows the
 DICOM objects generated during a Clinical Procedure to be automatically
 processed by VistA Imaging.
   
 These patches also optimize the availability of the VistA Imaging DICOM 
 Modality Worklist by putting the Clinical Procedures order on the 
 worklist at check-in time, as opposed to when the order is released. 
  
 Furthermore, these patches can provide the VistA Imaging HL7 order 
 message to instruments that need more information than available in the 
 current Clinical Procedures HL7 order message.
  
 *** Note - MD*1*60 is distributed separately, please see that patch 
 description for more details and installation instructions. ***
  
 Details
 =======
 Clinical Procedures (CP) and VistA Imaging (VI) CPRS Consult Request 
 Tracking DICOM are two very successful applications.
  
 Clinical Procedures primarily uses HL7 for its communications.  It has 
 two kinds of devices: unidirectional instruments and bidirectional 
 instruments.  Both send examination results to Clinical Procedures via 
 HL7.  A large variety of document types can be handled, with PDF being 
 the most popular.  Unidirectional instruments are not capable of 
 receiving HL7 orders and require manual entry of the patient and study 
 information. Bidirectional instruments can receive HL7 order information 
 prior to the examinations.  Some bidirectional Clinical Procedures 
 instruments include DICOM modalities.  
  
 VistA Imaging CPRS Consult Request Tracking uses an accession number that 
 has the format "sss-GMR-nnnnnnnn", where "sss" is the three-digit VA
 Station Number and "nnnnnnnn" is the internal entry number of the study in
 the REQUEST / CONSULTATION file (#123).  Automatic association of DICOM
 images in the VistA electronic health record (EHR) requires exact matches 
 for the patient name, medical record number (SSN in VA), and accession 
 number.
  
 The Clinical Procedures Instrument Order Number is derived from the 
 check-in date and time.  The Instrument Order Number is mapped to the 
 DICOM Accession Number (0008,0050) in the DICOM modalities that are in 
 use with Clinical Procedures. The DICOM objects created with this 
 accession number cannot be automatically processed by VistA Imaging.
  
 These patches improve interoperability by using the VistA Imaging consult 
 accession number (in the format "sss-GMR-nnnnnnnn") as the Clinical 
 Procedures Instrument Order Number. This results in the correct value for 
 the DICOM Accession Number (0008,0050) and allows Clinical Procedures' 
 DICOM objects to be automatically processed by VistA Imaging and inserted 
 into the EHR.
  
 DICOM instruments follow the established workflow of obtaining patient and
 study information from a Modality Worklist provider, acquiring DICOM
 objects, storing the patient and study data into the headers of the DICOM
 objects, and sending the DICOM objects to VistA.  The DICOM Text Gateway
 processes VistA Imaging HL7 order messages and puts the studies on the
 worklist. Some DICOM instruments for Clinical Procedures use DICOM
 Modality Worklist.                        
  
 These patches improve the timing of the DICOM Modality Worklist 
 information for Clinical Procedures.  Previously the VistA Imaging HL7 
 order message for Clinical Procedures was generated when the order is 
 released (i.e., "signed") which resulted in the study being put on the 
 worklist well in advance of the examination.  With these patches, the 
 VistA Imaging HL7 order message is generated when the clinical procedure 
 order is checked in. As a result, the study is put on the worklist just 
 when it is needed to provide the patient and study information for the 
 modality.
  
 With these patches, at check-in time, both the Clinical Procedures and
 VistA Imaging HL7 messages are created. Some instruments require fields
 that are not present in the Clinical Procedures HL7 order message.  The
 VistA Imaging HL7 message body provides these fields and can be used by
 Clinical Procedures instead.
  
 Note that if the Clinical Procedure uses DICOM instruments, the DICOM 
 Encapsulated PDF SOP Class is recommended for computer-generated PDF 
 reports. DICOM Encapsulated PDFs are more suitable for storage in an EHR 
 than raw PDFs because they contain patient and study identification 
 information and can be managed by the whole suite of DICOM services 
 (storage, display, query/retrieve, export, etc.).
  
  
 Overview of the New Capabilities
 ================================
 The new capabilities in these two patches only apply to bidirectional CP 
 instruments.  There are no changes for unidirectional CP instruments.
  
  
 CP Can Use VI Accession Number as Instrument Order Number
 =========================================================
 For designated CP instruments that generate DICOM objects, the VistA 
 Imaging consult / procedure accession number "sss-GMR-nnnnnnnn"
 can be used as the Clinical Procedure Instrument Order Number.  This
 permits DICOM objects created by the CP instrument to be automatically
 associated with the clinical procedure in VistA.
  
  
 CP Check-in Triggers the VistA Imaging HL7 Generation
 =====================================================
 Check-in of a Clinical Procedure triggers the generation of the VistA 
 Imaging HL7 order (ORM) message.  The VistA Imaging HL7 message will no 
 longer be generated prematurely when the order is released.
  
 The VistA Imaging DICOM Modality Worklist is populated with information 
 from the VistA Imaging HL7 order message.  Since the CP study shall be 
 put on the worklist at check-in instead of when the order was released, 
 the DICOM Modality Worklist will provide much more timely information.
  
 Note: The clinical procedure must have an entry in the CLINICAL SPECIALTY 
 DICOM & HL7 file (#2006.5831) to have DICOM Modality Worklist and HL7.  
 This is an existing requirement going back to MAG*3.0*10 DICOM - CONSULT 
 AND PROCEDURES INTERFACE (2003).
  
  
 CP Can Use VistA Imaging's HL7 Order Message Body
 =================================================
 The VistA Imaging HL7 order (ORM) message contains many more data fields 
 than the CP order message. The VistA Imaging HL7 order (ORM) message for 
 a Clinical Procedure is also backwards-compatible with the CP HL7 order 
 (ORM) message - all the fields in the Clinical Procedure HL7 order message
 are present in the VistA Imaging HL7 order message and contain the same 
 data. Some VI HL7 ORM fields have additional components, however.
  
 For designated CP instruments that need this additional information, the 
 VistA Imaging HL7 order message body can be used instead of the CP order 
 message.  The content of the CP HL7 order message will be replaced by the 
 VI HL7 order message, but the CP message transport mechanism will remain 
 the same: the same MSH message header segment is used, the same Logical 
 Link, and the same 1.6 HL7 communications package.
  
  
 New CP INSTRUMENT file (#702.09) CP - DICOM INTEROPERABILITY field (#.19)
 =========================================================================
 MD*1.0*60 adds the new CP - DICOM INTEROPERABILITY field (#.19) to the CP 
 INSTRUMENT file (#702.09).  This field is used to identify Clinical 
 Procedure instruments that (1) will use the VistA Imaging 
 consult/procedure accession number sss-GMR-nnnnnnnn as the Clinical 
 Procedure Instrument Order Number, and (2) will use the VistA Imaging HL7 
 message body instead of the Clinical Procedure HL7 message body. The 
 values for the field are <null>, 0, 1, or 2 accordingly.
