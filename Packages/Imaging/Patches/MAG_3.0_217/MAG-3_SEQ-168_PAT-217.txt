 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1. Defect 736370 (CA Ticket INC0129261) Unable to import non-DICOM studies
 to unregistered exams
 Problem: 
 ========
 The Importer is failing when importing a non-DICOM image to an
 unregistered exam.
  
 Study-level Failure Details: 
 Exception Type: 
 gov.va.med.imaging.core.interfaces.exceptions.MethodException
 Details Message: -1`2 error lines returned.
 -3`Parameter 'EXMDTE' has an invalid 
 value.^REGISTER+17~RAMAGRP1^E`EXMDTE='null000100'
  
 During a typical import the Exam Date value is determined one of two ways.
 It's either generated when registering an order in VistA, or it's obtained
 from the DICOM header of a DICOM image. Since a non-DICOM file does not
 have a DICOM header the Exam Date must be obtained from the exam 
 registration - if the order has not been registered an Exam Date is not 
 available, the import fails and an error is generated.
  
 Resolution: 
 ===========
 Do not allow Non-DICOM images to be imported against non-registered exams 
 by not displaying unregistered exams on the list of exams to choose from 
 when Importing. 
  
 2. Defect 738272 - Error doing a Direct Import. Importer cannot do an
 Import.
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 During Windows 10 testing, the Importer was not able to perform any Direct
 Import and the application was displaying the following error:

 cryptographic algorithms.

 Resolution: 
 ===========
 By replacing the MD5CryptoServiceProvider with the
 SHA512CryptoServiceProvider, the Importer application will able to import 
 images while running under the Windows 10 operating system.

 Patch Installation:
 ===================
 Supported Client Versions
 =========================
 When MAG*3.0*217 is released, the list of supported versions of Importer 
 will change:
 Supported Versions      No Longer Supported 
 3.0.217                 3.0.118
 3.0.206
 3.0.136
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ===============================
 MAG*3.0*217 must be installed on the VistA System. This patch must be 
 installed by the compliance date.
 All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of this 
 patch. This patch can be loaded while the VistA Imaging System is active 
 and users are on the system. Installing the MAG*3.0*217 KIDS only takes 
 2-3 minutes.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ===============================
 Verify that the patches listed in the Associated Patches section of this 
 document have been previously installed.
 Note: All released VistA Imaging patches must be installed on the VistA 
       system before installing MAG*3.0*217.
  
 Prerequisite: With the release of patch MAG*3.0*206 KIDS package, all 
               users who access the Importer application must be assigned
               the secondary menu option called "MAGTP WORKLIST MGR" in
               VistA. This is required because currently the REMOTE
               APPLICATION file has no entry available for the Importer
               application. This is a temporary work around until there is 
               an entry created for the Importer application via a patch
               release.
  
 VistA System (KIDS) Installation Instructions
 =============================================
 Installation Steps 
 ==================
 KIDS installation will take less than one minute.
 1  On the VistA system, access the Kernel Installation and Distribution
    System Menu [XPD MAIN].
 2  Run the Installation option [XPD INSTALLATION MENU].
 3  Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
    a. Run the Load a Distribution option [XPD LOAD DISTRIBUTION] to load

    c. When prompted to continue with the load, enter "YES". A
       Distribution OK! message will be displayed when the load is
       complete.
 4  After loading the KIDS file, use the following options to verify the
    contents of the patch and to back up any affected routines.
    a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global [XPD PRINT CHECKSUM] - Run 
       this option if you want to ensure the integrity of the routines in
       the patch.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE TO SYSTEM] -
       Run this option if you want to view all changes that will be made
       when the patch is installed. All components (routines, options, and 
       so on) in the patch will be compared.
    c. Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] - Run this option if you
       want to create a backup message of any routines exported with the
       patch.
       It will NOT back up any of the other changes.
 5  After performing the load and any optional verification steps, install
    the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
    a. Run the Install Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option.
    b. When prompted for the install name, enter "MAG*3.0*217".
    c. Answer "NO" to the following prompts, if they appear:
  Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO//

 Uninstalling MAG*3.0*217 KID
 =============================
 If it is necessary to uninstall the MAG*3.0*217 VistA KIDS, you needed to 
 select the "Kernel Installation & Distribution System" menu option, 
 "Backup a Transport Global" (see installation section above, step 4c), 
 before you installed the patch.
 Administrators will need to use the PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK 
 MESSAGE. Check your MailMan messages for the backup message sent by the 
 "Backup a Transport Global" function.
 1.  Select the message shown below:
 Backup of MAG*3.0*217 install on <mmm dd, yyyy>  <user name>
 2.  Select the Xtract PackMan option.
 3.  Select the Install/Check Message option.
 4.  Enter "Yes" at the prompt.
 5.  Enter "No" at the backup prompt. There is no need to back up the 
     backup.
 Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore// Xtract PackMan

 Warning: Installing this message will cause a permanent update of globals
          and routines.
 Do you really want to do this? NO// YES<Enter>
  
 Routines are the only parts that are backed up. NO other parts are backed
 up, not even globals. You may use the 'Summarize Message' option of
 PackMan to see what parts the message contains. Those parts that are not
 routines should be backed up separately if they need to be preserved.
  
 Shall I preserve the routines on disk in a separate back-up message? 
 YES// NO
 No backup message built.
