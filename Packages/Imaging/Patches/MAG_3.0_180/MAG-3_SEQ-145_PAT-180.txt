 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 1.      Defect 541286 (Ticket R12992774FY17) Cachi Shadowing Issue
 Problem: 
 The National VistA Support (NVS) Shadow Compare Utility is used to ensure 
 data-synchronization between Production VistA Cachi databases and their 
 shadowed counterparts.  NVS has been finding ^MAGDOUTP(2006.574) nodes on 
 shadows that are not on the source (Production) systems at several sites.
  
 Resolution: 
 Global locks and global lock checks were added to the routines (MAGDRPC4, 
 MAGDRPC9, and MAGDRPC3) that modify the ^MAGDOUTP(2006.574) global.
  
 2.      Defect 560333 (Ticket I14676743FY17) New Worklist Entry on a 
 Closed Consult
 Problem: 
 When a note is added to a "Closed Consult" in the Computerized Patient 
 Record System (CPRS) and the consult is saved without a signature, the
 system does not generate an entry on the Modality Worklist (MWL).  In the 
 previous version of VistA Imaging, users were able to add a note to a 
 closed consult and this would generate an entry on the MWL.
  
 Resolution: 
 The modality worklist routine was modified so that when an unsigned note 
 is added to a closed consult, the entry appears on the MWL.   
  
 3.      Defect 468447 (Ticket I12518848FY17) Consults not added to the 
 Modality Worklist 
 Problem: 
 Some consults are not being added to the MWL.  Consults from a specific 
 provider were not being added to the modality worklist. This particular 
 provider has 11 entries in the VISITED FROM field in the New Person (#200)
 file in VistA with "NO PHONE" as the phone number for many of the
 entries.  VistA Imaging pulls all the Visited From locations and phone 
 numbers for a provider when creating the HL7 message.  The number of 
 entries is causing the Observation Request (OBR) segment of the HL7
 message to be too long, causing it to be rejected.
  
 Resolution: 
 Routine MAGDHOW3 was modified to ignore phone numbers with the "NO PHONE" 
 entry and to truncate to allow only the first three phone numbers in the 
 segment. 
  
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 The following sites are test sites for this patch:

 Routines are the only parts that are backed up.  NO other parts
 are backed up, not even globals.  You may use the 'Summarize Message'
 option of PackMan to see what parts the message contains.
 Those parts that are not routines should be backed up separately
 if they need to be preserved.
  
 Shall I preserve the routines on disk in a separate back-up message? 
 YES// NO
 No backup message built.
