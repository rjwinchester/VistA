The Compliance Date has been edited for a "IMAGING" patch.
 
Patch:   MAG*3*180
Patch Subject:  VistA Updates
Patch Priority: MANDATORY

The Compliance Date for patch MAG*3*180 has been changed to APR 06, 2018


An issue was found with reading interfacility consults (IFC) using the Telereader application.

If you have installed this patch, you do NOT need to uninstall unless you are seeing the error <SUBSCRIPT>PHONE+11^MAGDHOW3 ^VA(200,"") in the VistA error trap.

Reason for Change:
Do NOT install if your site uses an IFC for Telereader. MAG*3*203 will 
correct the issue.  If you have installed this patch AND you use an IFC, 
patch 180 needs backed out.  Submit CA Ticket to NTL SUP Clin3 for 
assistance.
