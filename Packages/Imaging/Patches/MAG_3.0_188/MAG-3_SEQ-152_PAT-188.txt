 Files & Fields Associated:
 ==========================
 The following are two new FileMan (FM) Files included in MAG*3.0*188:
   MUSE TEST TYPES #2006.171 
         o This file will hold a list of MUSE Test Types that are used by 
           the MUSE FORMAT TABLE File to map a Test Type to a MUSE Format
           ID number.
         o The sites can add new Test Types to this file, if needed.  
               -IMPORTANT: The spelling of the Test Type that is entered
                into this file must EXACTLY match the spelling of the Test
                Type on the MUSE System.
  
   MUSE FORMAT TABLE #2006.172
         o This file is a mapping of MUSE Test Types to the MUSE Format ID 
           number for a specified MUSE System.  
               -The default Format ID's listed below are used by the MUSE
                System to compile the MUSE Test data, for the specified
                Test Type, into a PDF file for viewing.
                The default Format ID's cannot be modified.  
                The sites can add entries to this file if any of the 
                default mappings of MUSE Test Types to MUSE Format IDs is
                not correct for a certain MUSE System.  If site specific
                Format ID's have been entered into the MUSE FORMAT TABLE,
                those Format ID's will override the defaults.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1.Defect 541749 (Ticket I14967812FY17) Showing/Hiding Grid on EKGs 
  
 Problem:   
 MAG*3.0*167 inadvertently removed the ability to show/hide grid on EKGs.  
  
 Resolution: 
 A new menu option, Grid On, has been added to the Options menu of the 
 MUSE EKG Clinical Display window.  The menu option will default to 
 "checked" when the window is opened.
  
 When the Grid On option is checked, the test generated by the MUSE system 
 will include a grid. When Grid On is unchecked, the test generated by the 
 MUSE system will not include a grid.
  
 Note: The way that the grid is displayed on the image has changed in this 
 patch. In previous versions of the MUSE EKG Viewer, the patient test was
 retrieved from the MUSE system without a grid.  When the test was 
 displayed in the MUSE Viewer, a grid was drawn on top of the displayed 
 test.  In this patch, different MUSE test formats are used to generate 
 tests with and without grids.
  
  
 2. Defect 541795 (Trouble Ticket R14889502FY17) Printing Multiple Studies 
  
 Problem:  
 Clinical Display used to be able to select more than one EKG study and 
 print them at one time.  MAG*3.0*167 inadvertently removed that option.
  
 Resolution: 
 The EKG (ECG) Test Type List on the MUSE Viewer window has been modified
 to enable multiple selections.  The Popup Menu has a new Print Selected
 Images. option which will open the Printer Dialog window.  The user can
 select a printer and click "OK."  Selecting the File | Print Selected
 Images. option will also print the images selected in the EKG Test Type
 List.
  
 Notes: 
 The grid will also be printed if the Options | Grid menu option is 
 checked.  Multiple selections are accomplished by the standard methods: 
  
         Ctrl-Click to select an entry
         Click to open one test 
         Shift-click to select a range 
         Ctrl-click to select an additional entry.
  
 All tests selected in the EKG Test Type list will be printed when "Print
 Selected Images." is selected. 
  
 3. Defect 586331 (Trouble Ticket I17074853FY18, I16872958FY18, 
 R15933755FY17, R16210630FY17, R16376989FY17, R16454004FY17, & 
 I16715556FY17) Images Jumping in CT Images
  
 Problem:  
 In the Radiology viewer, CT images jump and the window/level functionality
 is not displayed properly if the images are scrolled quickly with the
 mouse.
  
 Resolution:  
 The code was modified to fix this issue.  Now when a CT preset is 
 selected, the window/level settings will not change when the user scrolls 
 quickly or clicks the Play button. 
  
 4. Defect 662033 (Trouble Ticket I16798961FY18): Image List Window Update
  
 Problem: 
 An issue was reported in the Image List window, that when the Columns are 
 resized or hidden, the changes are not saved in the User Preferences.
  
 Resolution: 
 The code was modified to fix this issue.  
  
 5. Defect 670519 (Trouble Ticket I18544856FY18): Grid On Feature Missing 
 With New MUSE
  
 Problem: 
 When the user changes Grid on/off, the user has to click on a different 
 test and back for it to reload the test with no Grid.
  
 Resolution: 
 When the user switches the grid setting, any images that are opened, will 
 be redisplayed with the new grid setting.
  
 The following is the MUSE Test Type and Format ID Mapping: 
  
 MUSE Test Type and Format ID Mapping:
 To display the MUSE Format Table, open the MUSE EKG Display viewer and 
 Select the menu: Options | Show Format Table.    The MUSE Format Table 
 window will be displayed and the default mappings will be listed.
  
 Default mapping: 
  
 MUSE Format Table Columns:
 Site:
   The MUSE System entry in the NETWORK LOCATION File.
  "All Sites" means the default mapping for all MUSE Systems.
  "All Sites" is not an entry in the NETWORK LOCATION File. 
  
 (Internal Entry Number) IEN:
  The Internal Entry Number is for the NETWORK LOCATION entry.
  '0' means the default mapping is for all MUSE Systems.
  
 Test Type:
  This field can be modified by the user.  
  
 Grid:
   Enter 'Yes' if a Grid is displayed, 'No' if a Grid is not displayed.
  
 Format ID:
   Enter the new Format ID Number for the Test Type.
  
  
 Modify MUSE FORMAT Table:
 Review the Appendix A for examples on modifying the MUSE FORMAT TABLE to 
 override the default Test Type - Format ID mappings.
  
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 The following sites are  test sites for this patch:
         VA Denver Health Care System
         Augusta VA Medical Center
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:

 Appendix A 
 ===========
 Format ID:
 Open the MUSE EKG Display window, and select the menu : Options | Show 
 Format Table to see the MUSE Format Table.
 Below is an example of the MUSE Format Table with only the default 
 mappings.
 The default mappings listed above may not be correct for all MUSE 
 Systems.  If this is the case, the user will need to override the default 
 mapping for that MUSE System. 
  
 Example: 
 Table MUSE A  below is a screen shot of a MUSE System with the default 
 mappings:
  
 (Table MUSE A)
  
 Table MUSE B below is a screen shot of a MUSE System with different 
 Format ID's than the defaults. 
 Notice in MUSE B below, the Format ID's  for VistA ECG, VistA HiRes, 
 VistA Stress and VistA Holter are different than the defaults in MUSE A.
  
 (Table Muse B) 
  
 The Site will have to override the Default Format IDs, and map the four 
 'VistA...' entries to the Format IDs that are on the user's system.
  
 Override a Default Format ID:
 To override a default Format ID, the user will need to make an entry into 
 the MUSE FORMAT TABLE #2006.172 File.
  
 Use FileMan Enter/Edit option to add a new entry to the file.
  
 Example: 
  
 SLC>D P^DI
  
 VA FileMan 22.2
  
 Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES
  
 Input to what File: MUSE FORMAT TABLE//   (0 entries)
 EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL//
  
 Select MUSE FORMAT TABLE DESCRIPTION: ZZZ MUSE VistA ECG
   Are you adding 'ZZZ MUSE VistA ECG' as
     a new MUSE FORMAT TABLE (the 1ST)? No// y  (Yes)
 NETWORK LOCATION: ZZZ MUSE SYS
 TEST TYPE: RestingECG
 GRID: N  NO
 FORMAT ID NUMBER: 11
 Select MUSE FORMAT TABLE DESCRIPTION:
  
 After all four overrides have been entered, Open the MUSE Format Table to 
 verify the change
 In the table above, the entry for the following has a format id of 11.
 Site : ZZZ MUSE SYS
 Test Type: RestingECG
 Grid: NO
  
 This Format ID of 11 for 'RestingECG'.  
  
 Verify the New Format ID:
 ===========================
 To determine what Format ID was used to generate the MUSE Test Image 
 follow the steps below: 
         Click on a Test option in the list. 
         After the Test is displayed,  check the menu:  Options | Show 
         Messages.
         A message area will display at the bottom of the window.
         Scroll to the bottom of the messages,  then scroll up until you 
 see 'Format ID = nn', which  will be the Format ID was used to generate 
 the Test.
 Below is an example of the message panel in the VistA Imaging MUSE EKG 
 Viewer:
  
 Add a New Test Type: 
 =================== 
 If a new Test Type is added to the MUSE System, the VistA Imaging MUSE 
 EKG Viewer will use the Format ID =1 to display Tests of that Type.
