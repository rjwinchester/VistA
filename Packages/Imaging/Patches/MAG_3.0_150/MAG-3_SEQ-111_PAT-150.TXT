 Patch MAG*3.0*150 Changes:
 ==========================
 Image Never Existed Summary:
    
 When an image is deleted, two main processes occur:
 1)        Queues are created for the Background Processor (BP) to copy the
           images from Tier 2 (Image Share) to Tier 3 storage (JukeBox)
           and the images are deleted from the Tier 2 storage.
    
 2)        The image entry is copied to the IMAGE AUDIT File (#2005.1) and
           is deleted from the IMAGE File (#2005).  
    
 Issue Summary:
    
 In the Imaging Display client, the Image List window displays a list of images
 for a patient and each list entry shows the status of the image.  The issue
 dealt with in this patch is when the image shows a status of "Deleted Image"
 when the image never existed. This status implies that there was once an image
 that has since been deleted.  This gives the user the incorrect assumption 
 that an image did exist at one time, when in fact, it never did.  
    
 Solution:
    
 When an Image Never Existed situation occurs on the Import API and Clinical 
 Capture workstation, a NOIMAGE flag is included in the Remote Procedure Call
 to delete an image. 
    
 Previous to the patch, the Delete function ignored this flag.  Changes in 
 MAG*3.0*150 have been made to handle the NOIMAGE flag.
    
 Background Processor: 
    
 When the NOIMAGE flag is detected, the Delete function will clear the pointers
 to Tier 2 storage before copying the image entry to the IMAGE AUDIT File
 (#2005.1), and the Delete function will not set a Delete Queue for this image.
    
 These two changes will stop the errors from occurring in the BP, because no 
 Delete Queue will have been created. 
   
 Image Display: 
   
 The Delete function will also set the status of the image to "Image Never
 Existed."  When the Image List window processes a list of patient images, it
 will ignore any image entry with a status of "Image Never Existed."
 Consequently, the user will not have a false impression that there ever was
 an image.

 Installation:
 =============
   
 Installation Planning:
   
 MAG*3.0*150 is to be installed on the VistA System.  This patch must be 
 installed by the compliance date to conform to the VHA Directive 2001-023.
 This patch may be loaded while VistA Imaging System is active. Installation for 
 the KIDS will take less than one minute. 
   
 Installation Prerequisites:
 Before installing this patch, you will need to download the MAG*3.0*150 files 
 from one of the OI Field Offices FTP servers. Verify that the patches listed
 in the section Associated Patches on Page 2 have been installed.
   
   
 VistA System (KIDS) Installation:
 =================================
   
 Installation Steps
 1.   Access the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu [XPD MAIN].
   
 2.   Run the Installation option [XPD INSTALLATION MENU].
   
 3.   Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
      a.  Run the Load a Distribution [XPD LOAD DISTRIBUTION]
          option to load the KIDS distribution.
        
      b.  When prompted, enter the path and file name (MAG3_0P150.KID) 
          of the MAG*3.0*150 KIDS file that you downloaded from the 
          Download Server.
          
      c.  When prompted to continue with the load, enter "YES". A 
          Distribution OK! Message will be displayed when the load is 
          complete.
        
 4.   After loading the KIDS file, use the following options to 
      verify the contents of the patch. This is a good time to back 
      up any affected routines.
   
      a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global [XPD PRINT 
          CHECKSUM] - Run this option if you want to ensure the integrity 
          of the routines in the patch.
   
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE 
          TO SYSTEM] - Run this option if you want to view all changes 
          that will be made when the patch is installed. All components 
          (routines, options, and so on) in the patch will be compared.
   
      c.  Back up a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] - Run this option if 
          you want to create a backup message of any routines exported with 
          the patch. The option will NOT back up any of the other changes.
   
 5.   After performing the load and any optional verification steps, 
      install the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
   
      a.  Run the Install Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option.
   
      b.  When prompted for the install name, enter MAG*3.0*150.
