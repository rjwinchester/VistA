Subject: VistARad Mainenance IX

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch addresses several VistARad performance problems introduced in 
 MAG*3.0*133.  It also enables the sites to suppress an incompatible 
 format warning that appears when VistARad attempts to open some TIF, PDF
 and JPG files.  Last, it corrects an issue with the installation of
 Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Runtime.
  
 NOTE   All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion
 of this patch. At sites that have implemented VistARad, installation of
 both the KIDS and the client software is required. The MAG*3.0*152 KIDS
 is backward-compatible with the MAG*3.0*133 and the MAG*3.0*120 client
 software. Installation of the client software may be phased in according
 to each site's needs.

 Summary
 =======
 MAG*3.0*152 addresses the following VistARad issues:
 -Performance problems with images containing DICOM overlays.
 -A redundant warning when VistARad attempts to open incompatible 
 file formats.
 -Install problems with Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Runtime.
  
 Issue- Poor Performance
 =======================
 The MAG*3.0*133 patch introduced several VistARad performance problems 
 that many sites found unacceptable.  These sites were forced to delay the 
 deployment of that patch until a resolution of these problems is found. 
  
 Problem
 =======
 The performance problems of MAG*3.0*133 were caused by an inefficient 
 implementation of DICOM group 6000 overlay rendering.  
  
 Solution
 ========
 In MAG*3.0*152, overlays are displayed only when the user does not 
 interact with the application.  Otherwise, they are hidden.
  
 Issue- Warning Suppression Issue
 ================================
 When VistARad MAG*3.0*133 encounters a non-radiology image format it 
 cannot display, it posts a warning: "1 file(s) with .tif, .pdf, or .jpg 
 extensions failed to open. They are likely scanned documents that may be 
 viewed using the VistA Imaging Display client."
  
 Problem
 =======
 Some sites with many non-radiology images found the warning repetitive 
 and redundant.
  
 Solution
 ========
 When an "unsupported image format" warning is posted, the program asks 
 the user if they want to suppress it for the remainder of the VistARad 
 session.  If the user agrees, the next time an unsupported file is shown, 
 there will be no warning.
  
 Issue- Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Runtime Not Installed
 ======================================================
 The install of the previous VistARad patch does not install the Microsoft 
 Visual C++ 2005 Runtime redistributable package.
  
 Problem
 =======
 As a result of this issue, VistARad would not start. Site personnel had 
 to go to each affected workstation, uninstall MAG*3.0*133, install 
 MAG*3.0*120 and reinstall MAG*3.0*133
  
 Solution
 ========
 The MAG*3.0*152 client installer installs the latest version of this 
 package if it is not present on the VistARad workstation.

   Redistributable Package.  Click "Install" to complete this step.
   b. There will be a brief delay as the VistARad installation files are 
   extracted.
  
 Note:  There are no configurable installation options. VistARad will be 
 installed in:  Windows XP: C:\Program Files\VistA\Imaging\MAG_VistARad 
 Windows 7: C:\Program Files (x86) \VistA\Imaging\MAG_VistARad.
