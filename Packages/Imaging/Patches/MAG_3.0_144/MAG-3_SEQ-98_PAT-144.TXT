Subject: MAG INDEX TERMS UPDATE

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 The MAG Index Terms are used in the indexing of images to allow clinicians to
 apply sort filters when viewing or researching images. Clinicians must 
 have the most recent Index Terms, otherwise they might encounter issues 
 when images are viewed across sites or the Veterans Integrated Service 
 Networks (VISN). 
  
 Previously, the VA used MailMan, an electronic messaging system, to
 distribute MAG Index Terms. However, VA MailMan is no longer used for this
 purpose. This patch will update the current MAG VistA Imaging Index Term
 files for the VHA and Indian Health Service (IHS) sites accordingly.
  
 The files to be updated are:
    
  #2005.82  IMAGE INDEX FOR CLASS FILE
  
 This file has all the class types of images and is used in the indexing of 
 images, which allow clinicians to apply sort filters when viewing or 
 researching images.
   
  #2005.83  IMAGE INDEX FOR TYPES FILE
  
 This file has all the types of images and is used in the indexing of images 
 to allow clinicians to apply sort filters when viewing or researching images.
   
  #2005.84  IMAGE INDEX FOR SPECIALTY/SUBSPECIALTY
  
 This file has all the specialties and subspecialties to associate with an 
 image. These specialties will be used to allow clinicians the flexibility to 
 filter images according to only the images they are interested in 
 researching or viewing.
   
  #2005.85  IMAGE INDEX FOR PROCEDURE/EVENT FILE
  
 This file has all the possible procedures or procedural events that an image 
 can be associated with and that will be used for indexing images. The 
 PROCEDURE/EVENT associated with an image can be used in filters defined by a 
 clinician.
