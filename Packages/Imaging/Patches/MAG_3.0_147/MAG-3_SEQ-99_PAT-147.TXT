Subject: PIXEL REPRESENTATION FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will avoid <UNDEFINED> errors caused by some encapsulated PDFs
 that do not follow the DICOM standard. This problem interrupts the importing
 workflow of some non-DICOM standard PDFs. Since some encapsulated PDFs do not
 contain all of the required pixel element data values, these DICOM objects
 currently cannot be imported by the DICOM Gateway. The patch allows for the
 importation of these objects.
