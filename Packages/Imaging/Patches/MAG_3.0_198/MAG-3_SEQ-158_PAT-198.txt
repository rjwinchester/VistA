 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview
 ===========================================
 1. Defect 557924 (CA Ticket # I12546712FY17) Verifier processing one IEN
 per minute.
  
 Problem:  
 ========
 When the Verifier is checking for the existence of an image on TIER 2
 Shares, the Verifier attempts to connect to each TIER 2 Share.  If 
 connection is successful, the Share is considered available and the 'Share
 Availability' is set to 'On-Line'. 
  
 The Verifier will iterate through the list of available TIER 2 Shares
 until the image is found.  The issue is that the Verifier does not take 
 into account the OPERATIONAL STATUS of the Share.  If the OPERATIONAL
 Status is 'Off-Line', the Verifier will still search this Share.  
 Searching of these Shares can take enormous amounts of time.
  
 Resolution:   
 ===========
 If a TIER 2 Share has OPERATIONAL STATUS = Off-Line, that Share will be 
 considered un-available, and will not be checked for the existence of the 
 Image.
 The Background Processor configuration file, MagBP.ini, has a new property
 to help in debugging future verifier issues. 
  
 Example: 
 ========
 [Verifier]
 Search Off Line Locations=FALSE
 In the Verifier section, the 'Search Off Line Locations=FALSE can be set 
 to TRUE. By setting the property to TRUE, the verifier will check TIER2 
 Locations that have OPERATIONAL STATUS=Off-Line.  
 Note: This setting is intended to be used when debugging issues in 
 conjunction with CLIN 3 support personnel. 
  
 Creating a Debug Log: 
 =====================
 A new Help menu item is provided for debugging purposes.
  
 The user will need to check the menu Help | Debugging Log, to have a Debug
 Log created with detailed trace of the Verifier process.  Since the 
 debugging logs can get very large, it will only be selectable when the
 user selects a range of images to verify. The Log file is named 
 'VerifierDebugLog-mmdd-hhmmss.log'. Once the debugging is on, it will 
 remain on until the user turns it off or changes the Scope to ALL.  Also, 
 if debugging is on, and the user selects a new Range, the current 
 debugging will still be turned on.  Debugging is Off by default any time 
 the Verifier starts. 
  
  Note: This setting is intended to be used when debugging issues in 
 conjunction with CLIN 3 support personnel.
  
 2. Defect 590817 (Ticket # R16489435FY17) BP Defrag process was causing an
 error and shutting down.
  
 Problem:
 ========
 A defrag process running to repoint images to the Storage Grid created 
 over 100K entries in the ABSTRACT queue.  When the Background Processor 
 was processing the ABSTRACT Queue, an Exception would occur and the 
 application would freeze.  The site had to repeatedly restart the 
 application in order to complete the Queue.
  
 Resolution:   
 ===========
 There was a memory leak in the MagThumbnailMaker.exe application.  The 
 memory leak was causing the exception to occur and the application to 
 freeze.   The MagThumbnailMaker.exe has been modified to stop the memory 
 leak. 
 The user interface for MagThumbnailMaker has changed as a result of the 
 fix for this issue. The message history (or log) is no longer displayed on
 the main window of the application.   Only the results of the last five
 Thumbnail attempts are displayed.  If an error occurs, details of the
 error message are always saved to the Log File.  To record all history of
 successful and failed abstracts, check the menu options 'Create Log
 File'.  To see the log, click the menu option: Options >Open Log 
 directory. The Log file is named 'MagThumbLog.log'
  
 Also on the main window, the total number of successful and failed 
 abstracts is displayed. The numbers include all abstract attempts since 
 the Start Time of the MagThumbnailMaker application.
  
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 The following sites are test sites for this patch:

 Patch Installation:
 ===================
 Desktop Icons used in Patch 198
 ===============================
 Version control will change when the MAG*3.0*198 KIDS is installed. The 
 supported BP Client versions will be: Patch 135, Patch 196 or Patch 198.
 Note: When a user enters invalid Access/Verify Codes while logging into 
 VistA, the system gives them an error message.
  
 In patch 198, the Error message is hidden under the main Vista Sign-on 
 window. The user has to move the VistA Sign-on window, then click 'OK' in 
 the Error message window to be able to continue. A fix for this issue is 
 scheduled for a future Background Processor patch.
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ===============================
 MAG*3.0*198 KIDS must be installed on the VistA System prior to running 
 the new executables.  This patch must be installed by the compliance 
 date. 
 All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of this 
 patch.  This patch may be loaded while the VistA Imaging System is 
 active.  Installation will take less than one minute.
  
 Important: Any Background Processor applications that are running must be 
 stopped and closed prior to the installation of the KIDS and Client 
 software. Any image capture application (Clinical Capture and DICOM 
 Gateway processing) can continue to run during the installation.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ==============================
 If a previous version of MAG*3.0*198 has been installed on the 
 workstation, it must be uninstalled before installing the new version. 
 Verify that the patches listed in the Associated Patches section of this 
 document have been previously installed.  Any Background Processor task 
 that is running (Queue Processor, Verifier, Purge) must be stopped 
 (applications must be closed) prior to the installation of the KIDS 
 file.  However, any image capture application (Clinical Capture and DICOM 
 Gateway processing) can continue to operate.
  
 Note:  All released VistA Imaging Background Processor patches must be 
 installed on the VistA system before installing MAG*3.0*198.

 For 64-bit OS installs: 
 =======================
 Log into the BP Server as an administrator.  For Step 2 below, use the 
 "Run as Administrator" option when installing BP storage software on a 
 64-bit Windows OS, such as Windows 2012 Server. 
  
 To install the MAG*3.0*198 Background Processor client:
 =======================================================
 1) Remove any previously installed versions of the VistA Imaging
    Background Processor.  The MAG*3.0*198 client is a full install of the
    BP suite of applications.
    If a previous version of MAG*3.0*198 has been installed on the 
    workstation, it must be uninstalled before installing the new version
    of MAG*3.0*198.
 2) Locate and run the MAG3_0P198Background_Processor_Setup.exe file. Use
    the "Run as Administrator" option when installing BP storage software 
    on a 64-bit Windows OS, such as Windows 2012 Server.

 7) After installation of MAG*3.0*198, there should be one entry in 
    Control Panel | Programs and Features for the Background Processor 
    applications:
    MAG*3.0*198: VistA Imaging Background Processor 198        30.52.198.nn
  
 New Server Installation:
 ========================
 MAG*3.0*198 contains all the Background Processor and Background Processor
 utility applications.  It will install on a new server that hasn't had a
 previous BP installed. 
 Desktop shortcuts for the Purge, Verifier and Background Processor Queue 
 Processor are automatically created on the desktop. 
  
 If installing the BP Queue Processor, BP Verifier, and BP Purge on a 
 64-bit operating system such as Windows 2012 Server, "Run as
 administrator" must be manually set using the check box in the Advanced 
 Properties window on each of the desktop shortcuts and the menu options. 
 Do this for all three client applications.
  
 If the MAG*3.0*198 Background Processor client is installed before 
 installing the MAG*3.0*198 KIDS, a message will display when the client 
 is run that says the versions of the Background Processor client and the 
 version of the VistA Imaging host system are not compatible.  The user 
 will be prompted to install compatible versions of the Background 
 Processor client and the VistA system host software.  If such a message 
 displays, complete the following steps: 
 1) Shut down the Background Processor client. 
 2) Install the MAG*3.0*198 KIDS. 
 3) Now run the MAG*3.0*198 Background Processor client. 
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 ===============================
 Restart all Background Processor applications that were stopped for 
 installation.
