 Defect Tracking System Tickets
 =============================== 
 1.  Defect 901131 - Operating System is not displaying in Message 
     History on Windows 10 workstations.
  
 Problem:
 ========  
 When running Vista Image Clinical Display on a Windows 10 operating system
 the Message History screen does not show the proper Operating System.  The
 message history displays:
  
    Imaging Session : message history.
    *** Operating System: CANNOT DETERMINE OPERATING SYSTEM TYPE
  
 This error does not prevent Clinical Display from working on a workstation
 using the Windows 10 operating system. The operating system is for
 informational purposes in the Message History.
  
 Resolution: 
 ===========
 Code was added to search for an operating system's major and minor
 versions equal to Windows 10.  When a match is located the message history
 will display:
    Imaging Session: message history.
    *** Operating System: WINDOWS 10
  
 2.  Defect 885360 (Trouble Ticket INC1683367) The Specific Accession 
     Number is not being displayed 
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 Site Specific Accession Numbers (SSAN) do not display in the Radiology 
 Exam window. 
  
 Resolution:
 =========== 
 The MAGGRADLIST Remote Procedure was updated to return a site-specific 
 accession when the radiology exam has a site-specific accession number 
 defined (file 70, field 31).
