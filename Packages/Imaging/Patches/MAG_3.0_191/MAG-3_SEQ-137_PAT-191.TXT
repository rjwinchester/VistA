 Subject:  CLINICAL DISPLAY ROI PRINT ISSUE
 =======
  
 Category:  OTHER
 ========
  
 Description:
 ===========
 MAG*3.0*191 resolves the Release of Information (ROI) print and MUSE 
 Viewer Window Modifications Needed issues.  The ROI issue is that when a
 patient is changed in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) while
 a ROI print job is running on Clinical Display, the ROI print job might
 combine images from the newly selected patient into the ROI print job of
 the first patient.  For MUSE issues, the patch will fix the toolbars for
 the newest version of the Imaging MUSE Viewer, fix issues where the tool
 bar is hidden, correct the sort of the list of studies in reverse
 chronological order, with the most current study at the top of the list,
 and allow the window settings to be saved when exiting the Viewer.
  
 NOTE: MAG*3.0*191 Clinical Display MUSE Electrocardiogram (EKG) Viewer 
 requires that the new MUSE API 3 service is installed and running on the
 MUSE System.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
  
 1.  Defect 553145 (Trouble Ticket I15262086FY17) Release of Information 
 (ROI) Printing Multiple Patients' Information
  
 Overview:  The ROI Process Images window is opened from the Image List 
 window.
  
 From the Image List window, click "Utilities|ROI Processing Options 
 Choose Images to process".  The user will typically select the images to
 process and then click the Continue button. The Process Images for:
 Patient window will open.
  
 The Process Images window has two versions of VistA Imaging (VI) ROI.  
 These versions are represented by the two tabs at the bottom of the
 window:  Print the Disclosure and To File and CD tabs.
  
 Print the Disclosure tab:  This is the older version of VI ROI.  This 
 version only prints non- Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine
 (DICOM) patient images.  The ROI process is executed in real time from the
 Clinical Display application.  It is not processed as a background job.
  
 To File and CD tab:  This version was released with MAG*3.0*130.  This 
 version will process all images for a patient.  This ROI process is
 executed by the VistA Imaging Exchange (VIX) on the VIX System.  DICOM
 images are printed on a CD writer selected by the user.  Non-DICOM images
 are compiled into one or more files and saved as a zipped file on the
 VIX.  The user can download the zipped file of the processed images and
 release it to the patient.
  
 Problem:  The issue happens when "Print the Disclosure" is used, an ROI 
 process has been started and the user changes patients from CPRS.  In that
 situation, the ROI Print process might combine images from the newly
 selected patient into the ROI print job of the first patient.
  
 Resolution:  Patient synchronization on a Clinical Context Object 
 Workgroup (CCOW) enabled desktop is handled by the Vergence Context
 Manager.  When the patient is changed in CPRS, the Context Manager sends a
 Patient Change Pending message to all CCOW enabled applications.
  
 Clinical Display was NOT correctly processing or responding to the 
 Patient Change Pending message.  In Patch 191, Clinical Display has been
 fixed in two ways:
  
 1.  When selecting studies for processing, the default has changed to NOT 
 select all studies. Previously the default was to select all studies for
 processing.  Clinical Display will not add any images from a newly
 selected patient into the ROI print job of a previously selected patient.
  
 2. Clinical Display will correctly respond to the Patient Change Pending 
 message. 
  
 Clinical Display responds to the Context Manager that it cannot change 
 patients at this time.  The response is a message to be displayed to the
 user.  The message warns the user that the ROI Report may be incomplete if
 the patient is changed at this time.
  
 The message received is: "ROI is Processing.  The Report may be 
 INCOMPLETE if you continue with Patient Change."  This warning is
 displayed in the message dialog and the user is asked if they want to
 continue with the Patient Change.  The Context Manager displays the
 message to the user and the user has three options.
  
 The three user choices are:  OK, Cancel, or Break Link.  Cancel is the 
 default choice and is the suggested option for the end user.  All three
 options are detailed below:
  
 1.  If the OK button is selected:
 The user has chosen to force a patient change in Clinical Display.  The 
 patient will be changed in CPRS and Clinical Display.  The Process Images
 window will be closed AND the ROI print job will be canceled.  This could
 result in an INCOMPLETE ROI print (i.e., the ROI print report may not have
 all the images that were selected to print).
  
 2.  If Cancel is selected:
 The patient change is canceled. CPRS, Clinical Display, and the Process 
 Images windows will all remain synchronized with the originally selected
 patient.  The ROI print job will continue until finished.
  
 3.  If the Break Link button is selected:
 The user has selected to break the link in CPRS.  CPRS will no longer be 
 joined to CCOW Patient Context and the patient change will happen in CPRS
 only.  The CCOW Broken Link icon will be displayed in CPRS. 
  
 Clinical Display remains "In Patient Context."  The patient will not
 change in Clinical Display or the Process Images window.  The ROI print
 job will continue until finished.
  
 2.  Defect 527237 (Trouble Ticket R13454874FY17) MUSE Viewer Window 
 Modifications Needed
  
 Problem: The toolbars for this version of the Imaging MUSE Viewer are
 different, and when the Viewer opens, some of the toolbar buttons are
 hidden by the list of tests. Another issue to be corrected is to sort the
 list of studies in reverse chronological order, with the most current
 study at the top of the list.  The last correction is to allow the window
 settings to be saved when exiting the Viewer.
  
 Resolution:  When the Viewer opens, the default layout of the toolbar 
 will be three rows and the list of studies will be sorted in reverse
 chronological order.
  
 Also, modifications have been made to the User Preferences for the new 
 MUSE Viewer in the following ways:
    Image Fit setting (Fit to Window, Fit to Width, Fit to Height)
    Row and column count for displayed images.
    Toolbar Break settings.  This indicates if the toolbars are on
 individual rows, one above the other, or all on one line.
