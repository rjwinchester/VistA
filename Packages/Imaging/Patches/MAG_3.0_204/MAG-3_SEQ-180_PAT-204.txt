 ==================
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ===============================
 MAG*3.0*204 must be installed on the VistA System and on 64-bit HDIG
 servers.  This patch must be installed by the compliance date. All sites
 running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of this patch.  
 This patch can be loaded while the VistA Imaging System is active and
 users are on the system.  Installing the MAG*3.0*204 KIDS takes 2-5 
 minutes.
  
 Note:  HDIG will not install on 2003 and 2008 servers.  
 =====
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ==============================
 Verify that the patches listed in the Associated Patches section of this 
 document have been previously installed.
  
 Note:  Use Windows Updater to install any security updates available for 
 =====  .NET 4.6.2 and above. If there are issues installing the .NET
        framework please reach out to the Helpdesk or Clin3.
  
 Note:  More recent .NET updates can be installed, but make sure that .NET 
 =====  4.6.2 and above are included in the installation.
  
 Note:  If the Tier 1 equipment vendor (i.e., HP) template is used to 
 =====  create the virtual machine, then the appropriate .NET version will
        be included.
  
 Verify the current .NET Version that is installed:
 ==================================================
 1.  From the Start menu, choose Run, enter regedit, and then select 
     OK.
  
 Note:  You must have administrative credentials to run regedit.
 =====
  
 2.  In the Registry Editor, open the following subkey: 
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full.
     If the Full subkey isn't present, then you don't have the .NET
     Framework 4.5 or later installed.
  
 Note:  The NET Framework Setup folder in the registry does not begin with 
 =====  a period.
  
 3.  Check for a DWORD entry named Release. If it exists, then you have
     .NET Framework 4.5 or later versions installed. Its value is a release
     key that corresponds to a particular version of the .NET Framework. In
     the following figure, for example, the value of the Release entry is
     378389, which is the release key for .NET Framework 4.5.
   
 4.  Check to make sure .NET 4.6.2 and above is installed before installing
     the HDIG Installer.  Reference the Hybrid DICOM Installation Guide for
     more information.

 select the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu option, Backup 
 a Transport Global (see section above, Vista System (KIDS) Installation 
 Instructions, step 4c), before you installed the patch.
 Administrators will need to use the PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK 
 MESSAGE. Check your MailMan messages for the backup message sent by the 
 Backup a Transport Global function.
