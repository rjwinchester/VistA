 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1. Defect 732117 (Ticket # I19448105FY18) - Duplicate Radiology 
 Orders - Over 5000 Radiology orders were generated for a patient by 
 mistake. 
  
 Problem:
 ========   
 When using the importer to acquire images with the option to create a 
 radiology order, sometimes the imported items cause the radiology order 
 to be created repeatedly.  Most of these duplicates occur when using 
 staged media but it can also happen with direct imports in certain
 situations.
  
 Resolution:    
 ===========
 The code was updated to do the following:
 1.  Check whether Reconciliation object is null during FailedImport.
 2.  Change the MAG WORK ITEM status first and then update the 
     ImporterWorkItemDetails.xml file during FailedImport and
     ImportComplete status.
 3.  VistA Remote Procedure Call MAGV RAD EXAM ORDER was updated to allow
     for only a maximum number (default of 10) of identical radiology
     procedure orders to be created for a single patient per day. If the
     IMPORTER PROCEDURE/DAY MAX (#305)field in the IMAGING SITE PARAMETERS
     (#2006.1) file is set then this value will be used to determine the 
     maximum number of identical radiology procedures orders that can be
     created for a single patient per day. If this field is not set then
     only 10 identical orders can be created per day.

 Patch Installation:
 ===================
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ===============================
  
 MAG*3.0*194 must be installed on both the VistA System and on 64-bit HDIG 
 servers.  This patch must be installed by the compliance date.
 All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of this 
 patch.  This patch can be loaded while the VistA Imaging System is active 
 and users are on the system. Installing the MAG*3.0*194 KIDS takes 2-5 
 minutes.
  
 Note:  The HDIG will not install on 32-bit machines with a Windows 
 operating system such as 2003 Server.  There is also a known issue if 
 there are multiple installations of Java versions on the HDIG system:
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ==============================
 Verify that the patches listed in the Associated Patches section of this 
 document have been previously installed.
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
 VistA System (KIDS) Installation Instructions:
 ==============================================
 Installation Steps 
 ==================
 KIDS installation will take less than one minute.
 1. On the VistA system, access the Kernel Installation and 
 Distribution System Menu [XPD MAIN].
 2. Run the Installation option [XPD INSTALLATION MENU].
 3. Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
    a. Run the Load a Distribution option [XPD LOAD DISTRIBUTION] to 
    load the KIDS distribution.
    b. When prompted, enter the path and file name (MAG3_0P194.KID) of 
    the MAG*3.0*194 KIDS file.
    c. When prompted to continue with the load, enter "YES". A 
    Distribution OK! message will be displayed when the load is complete.
 4. After loading the KIDS file, use the following options to verify 
    the contents of the patch and to back up any affected routines.
    a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global [XPD PRINT CHECKSUM] - Run 
    this option if you want to ensure the integrity of the routines in the 
    patch. 
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE TO 
    SYSTEM] - Run this option if you want to view all changes that will be 
    made when the patch is installed.  All components (routines, options,
    and so on) in the patch will be compared.
    c. Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] - Run this option if you 
    want to create a backup message of any routines exported with the
    patch.
    It will NOT back up any of the other changes.
 5. After performing the load and any optional verification steps, 
    install the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
    a. Run the Install Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option.
    b. When prompted for the install name, enter "MAG*3.0*194".
    c. Answer "NO" to the following prompts, if they appear:
  Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO//
  Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//
  Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO//
 6. When installation is finished, an Install Complete message will 
    be displayed.
