 Description:
 ============
 This patch, MAG*3.0*192, fixes the Duplicate Rad Order Issue in HDIG. 
 This issue occurred when Importer was utilized to create an order and
 passed the order to HDIG for processing. The HDIG processed the work item,
 but the status of the work item did not change to 'complete' but rather
 remained in the "importing" status. This caused HDIG to generate multiple
 orders/exams for the same date/time. In some cases, the system created
 thousands of duplicate orders and/or exams.

 I15448096FY17, R14988401FY17, I15448096FY17, and R15332796FY17) Duplicate
 Rad Order Issue
  
 Problem:  
 When the Importer application is used to create an order and import 
 images, a work item is created containing information on images, study,
 provider, etc. The Importer puts the work item into the queue and the HDIG
 processes it. After the work item is successfully processed, the HDIG
 changes the status to "Complete" and moves on to the next work item to be
 processed. If there is no work item in the queue, then the HDIG will go
 dormant.
  
 The Radiology package in VistA is designed to limit creation of
 orders/exams for the same work item to 10 times. After trying for 10 times
 without success, the system should generate the following error message:
  (-29`Too many registered exams with almost the same date/time.^LOCKDT
 +46~RAMAG03D^W). After the error, the HDIG should then stop processing 
 the work item and mark the status of the work item as "FailedImport." 
  
 In the duplicate Rad order issue, when the HDIG processed the work item,
 the status of the work item did not change to "Complete" but instead
 remained in the Importing status. The HDIG would then go dormant for 60
 seconds. At that time, the HDIG would wake up and process the same work
 item again (with the same study time for the same patient), far exceeding
 the 10 attempts limit before giving the error. 
  
 The HDIG would keep processing the same work item and creating 
 orders/exams. The number of times HDIG processed the same work items was
 not consistent. As a result, some users were seeing thousands of duplicate
 Radiology orders/exams when using the Importer to import an image.
  
 Resolution:  
 The duplicateRadOrderLimit field was added to the
 DicomServerConfiguration.config to limit the number of duplicates
 allowed.  The entry will default to two duplicates.
  
 The work item will continue to be processed every 60 seconds.  If a 
 duplicate with the same study date and time is found with the same
 patient, it will only allow creation of duplicates based on the
 configuration setting of the DicomServerConfiguration.config file. If
 the duplicates reach the maximum number of duplicates, the work item will 
 be set to "FailedImport."  There will be an entry added to the
 FailedImport List in the Importer with the following error message:
  
 "Too many orders with almost the same date/time - Please submit ticket 
 with the National Help Desk to request assistance from Clin 3. 3 Orders
 are created for the same Study Date: YYYYMMDD and Study Time: 000000".
  
 An email message will be generated stating that the import failed. An 
 example of the email text is given below:
 "Importer item with IEN '123' failed processing.  Please navigate to 
 Failed Imports in the Administration area of the Importer GUI for more
 details.  * Study 1: 1 image failed to process.  Submitted by: Thu Sep 28

 Patch Installation:
 ===================
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ===============================
 MAG*3.0*192 must be installed on both the VistA System and on 64-bit HDIG 
 servers.  This patch must be installed by the compliance date.
  
 All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of this 
 patch.  This patch can be loaded while the VistA Imaging System is active
 and users are on the system.Installingsystem. Installing the MAG*3.0*192
 KIDS takes 2-5 minutes.
  
 Note:  
 =====
 HDIG will not install on 32-bit machines with a Windows operating system 
 such as 2003 Server.  There is also a known issue if there are multiple
 Java versions on the system for HDIG:
   For a fresh installation, remove all installed Java applications before 
 the installation of MAG*3.0*192
   If updating, remove installed Java if it's not version 1.6.0_45
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ==============================
 Verify that the patches listed in the Associated Patches section of this 
 document have been previously installed.
  
 VistA System (KIDS) Installation Instructions

 Installation Guide.
  
 Uninstalling MAG*3.0*192
 ========================
 If it is necessary to uninstall the MAG*3.0*192 VistA KIDS, you needed to 
 select the "Kernel Installation & Distribution System" menu option,
 "Backup a Transport Global" (see installation section above, step 4c),
 before you installed the patch.
  
 Administrators will need to use the PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK 
 MESSAGE.  Check your MailMan messages for the backup message sent by the
 "Backup a Transport Global" function.
  
 1.       Select the message shown below:
  
 Backup of MAG*3.0*192 install on <mmm dd, yyyy>    <user name>
  
 2.      Select the Xtract PackMan option.
 3.      Select the Install/Check Message option.
 4.      Enter "Yes" at the prompt.
 5.      Enter "No" at the backup prompt.  There is no need to back up the 
 backup.

 Select PackMan function: Select PackMan function: 6  INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE
  
 Warning:  Installing this message will cause a permanent update of globals
 and routines.
 Do you really want to do this? NO// YES<Enter>
  
 Routines are the only parts that are backed up.  NO other parts
 are backed up, not even globals.  You may use the 'Summarize Message'
 option of PackMan to see what parts the message contains.
 Those parts that are not routines should be backed up separately
 if they need to be preserved.
  
 Shall I preserve the routines on disk in a separate back-up message? 
 YES// NO
 No backup message built.
