 Description:
 ===========
 MAG*3.0*179 provides two-factor authentication (2FA) for Importer. When 
 the user starts the Importer application, they will be prompted for their
 Personal Identity Verification (PIV)/Personal Identification Number (PIN)
 to log into Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology
 Architecture (VistA). A splash screen will be displayed during startup and
 initialization of the Importer application.  The splash screen will close 
 when the application is ready to be used.  There are no other changes to
 functionality of Importer.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
 1. Update Importer/VIX with 2FA
 ===============================
 Problem:  Per a VA mandate, all existing systems must be upgraded to use 
 PIV credentials for authentication.
  
 Resolution:  The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker establishes a common 
 and consistent connection for VistA client/server applications.  The
 kernel development team has updated the RPC Broker to accept a PIV for
 authentication in XWB*1.1*64 and RPC Broker Development Tool Kit
 XWB*1.1*65.  The RPC Broker client component uses the IAM SSOi Secure 
 Token Service (STS) for Authentication.  The client authenticates to IAM
 with PIV/PIN and obtains an SAML token; this token is associated with a
 VistA access/verify code and is used to authenticate to VistA.
  
 The Importer will be updated to prompt users for PIV/PIN which, upon 
 success, will provide the SAML token.  This SAML token will be passed over
 to the VIX application through a restful service call which will then
 authenticate the user in VistA.
  
 Test Sites:
 ==========
 The following sites are test sites for this patch:
   VA Southern Nevada HCS (Las Vegas)
  
 *A test waiver has been approved to allow for testing to proceed with one 
 site.
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 =================================================
 Software being released and/or documentation describing the new 
 functionality introduced by this patch are available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from 
 anonymous@download.vista.domain.ext from the 
  
 COMMAND prompt (example:  sftp anonymous@download.vista.domain.ext). This 
 transmits the files from the first available server.
  
 Sites may also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at the following OI Field Offices:
  
 When using Attachmate Reflection (Secure Shell):
 Albany:         domain.ext
 Hines:          domain.ext
 Salt Lake City: domain.ext
  
 When using the COMMAND prompt (example: sftp
 anonymous@domain.ext): 
 Albany:         anonymous@domain.ext
 Hines:          anonymous@domain.ext

 Patch Installation:
 ==================
 Supported Client Versions
 =========================
 When MAG*3.0*179 is released, the list of supported versions of Importer 
 and VIX will change:
  
 Importer
 ========
 Supported Versions      No Longer Supported 
 3.0.179                 3.0.118
 3.0.136
  
 VIX
 ===
 Supported Versions      No Longer Supported 
 3.0.179                 3.0.157
 3.0.162                 3.0.119
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ==============================
 MAG*3.0*179 must be installed on the VistA System.  This patch must be 
 installed by the compliance date.
  
 All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of this 
 patch.  This patch can be loaded while the VistA Imaging System is active
 and users are on the system.
  
 Installing the MAG*3.0*179 KIDS only takes 2-3 minutes.
  
 Windows Registry
 ================
 With the addition of the RPC Broker as part of the 2FA effort, Importer 
 will now rely on VistA server information available in the Windows
 Registry for each client computer that installs the Importer
 application.  This registry setting is a requirement of the RPC Broker and
 some other VistA client applications; it is possible that the settings
 already exist on a client computer, however it should be confirmed before
 installing Importer.  As mentioned above, the following may require
 support from local site administrators.
  
 Open the Registry Editor and browse to the 
 \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node key.  If a "Vista" key exists,
 expand it, if not create it.  If a "Broker" key exists, expand it, if not
 create it.  If a "Servers" key exists, expand it, if not create it so that
 the full path is:
  
 \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE,Wow6432Node\Vista\Broker\Servers
  
 Within this key, one (or more) String values are required.  The name of 
 Registry String should contain the IP address or Fully Qualified Domain
 Name (FQDN) of the VistA server, a comma, and then the port number that
 will accept remote connections.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 =============================
 Verify that the patches listed in the Associated Patches section of this 
 document have been previously installed.
  
 Note:
 ====
 All released VistA Imaging patches must be installed on the VistA system 
 before installing MAG*3.0*179.
  
 Prerequisite:
 ============
 Before installing the P179 KIDS package, all users who access the 
 Importer application must be assigned the secondary menu option called
 "MAGTP WORKLIST MGR" in VistA. This is required because currently the
 REMOTE APPLICATION file has no entry available for the Importer
 application.  This is a temporary work around until there is an entry
 created for the Importer application via a patch release.
  
 VistA System (KIDS) Installation Instructions
 =============================================
 Installation Steps 
 ==================
 KIDS installation will take less than one minute.
 1. On the VistA system, access the Kernel Installation and Distribution 
 System Menu [XPD MAIN].
 2. Run the Installation option [XPD INSTALLATION MENU].
 3. Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
   a. Run the Load a Distribution option [XPD LOAD DISTRIBUTION] to load 
   the KIDS distribution.
   b. When prompted, enter the path and file name (MAG3_0P179.KID) of the 
   MAG*3.0*179 KIDS file.
   c. When prompted to continue with the load, enter "YES". A Distribution 
   OK! message will be displayed when the load is complete.
 4. After loading the KIDS file, use the following options to verify the 
 contents of the patch and to back up any affected routines.
   a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global [XPD PRINT CHECKSUM] - Run this 
 option if you want to ensure the integrity of the routines in the patch.
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE TO SYSTEM] - 
 Run this option if you want to view all changes that will be made when the
 patch is installed.  All components (routines, options, and so on) in the
 patch will be compared.
   c. Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] - Run this option if you want 
 to create a backup message of any routines exported with the patch.  It
 will NOT back up any of the other changes.
 5. After performing the load and any optional verification steps, install 
 the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
   a. Run the Install Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option.
   b. When prompted for the install name, enter "MAG*3.0*179".
   c. Answer "NO" to the following prompts, if they appear:
  
  Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO//
  Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//
  Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO//
  
 6. When installation is finished, an Install Complete message will be 
 displayed.
