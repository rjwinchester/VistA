 Defect Tracking System Tickets:
 ===============================
 1.  Defect 738278 - Operating System is not displaying in Message
 History on Windows 10 workstations. 
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When running Vista Image Clinical Capture on a Windows 10 operating 
 system the Message History screen does not show the proper Operating 
 System.  The message history displays:
  
    Imaging Session: message history.
    *** Operating System: CANNOT DETERMINE OPERATING SYSTEM TYPE
  
 This error does not prevent Clinical Capture from working on a 
 workstation using the Windows 10 operating system. The operating system 
 is for information purposes in the Message History.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Code was added to search for an additional operating system's major and 
 minor versions equal to Windows 10.  When a match is located the message 
 history will display:
 Imaging Session: message history. *** Operating System: WINDOWS 10

 Warning:  Installing this message will cause a permanent update of globals
           and routines.
 Do you really want to do this? NO// YES<Enter>
  
 Routines are the only parts that are backed up.  NO other parts
 are backed up, not even globals.  You may use the 'Summarize Message'
 option of PackMan to see what parts the message contains.
 Those parts that are not routines should be backed up separately
 if they need to be preserved.
  
 Shall I preserve the routines on disk in a separate back-up message? 
 YES// NO
 No backup message built.
