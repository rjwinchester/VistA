 The requirements planned for the Image Viewer Version 1.5 Sprints 25-28 were 
 verified and validated during the Development Independent Testing (DIT) phase of 
 testing and System Integration Testing (SIT). All requirements mapped to the 
 test scripts. The scripts are designed to be end-to-end functional tests of the 
 system to evaluate all the technical requirements including the testing of 
 external interfaces where appropriate. 
   
 The DIT cycle consisted of line of sight testing and the formal DIT. Before 
 starting the DIT cycle, a CVIX baseline is installed on the 
 system. Tests are then run against this software baseline. Any issues 
 found and potential resolutions are assessed for possible inclusion in the 
 software baseline. 
   
 The SIT cycle consisted of smoke testing and the formal SIT. Before 
 starting the SIT cycle, an updated CVIX baseline is installed on the 
 system. Tests are then run against this software baseline. Any issues 
 found and potential resolutions are assessed for possible inclusion in the 
 software baseline. 
   
 During SIT, the test team validated the requirements provided in the RTM 
 using the test scripts and the test cases. Any issues encountered is 
 recorded as a defect in Rational Quality Manager.
