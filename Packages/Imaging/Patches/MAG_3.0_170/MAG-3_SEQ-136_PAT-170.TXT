Description:
============

 This document describes MAG*3.0*170, the VIX Image Viewer patch.
 This patch adds a Zero footprint HTML5 based image viewer to the VIX to support 
 viewing images in VA Web Applications such as eHMP and JLV.
 Major changes for this patch are summarized below.  For detailed information, 
 refer to the change summary on page 3.
  
 MAG*3.0*170 contains the following new features:
 New VIX services that support image pre-processing and image viewing in a web 
 browser.
 A VIX configuration option that does not require a corresponding VistA instance.
   
 This configuration is called a relay VIX or rVIX and is co-located with  
 the eHMP or JLV web servers to supply study metadata from a close proximity.
 An HTML5 Zero Footprint image viewer that can be invoked by client software 
 interacting with any VIX instance.
