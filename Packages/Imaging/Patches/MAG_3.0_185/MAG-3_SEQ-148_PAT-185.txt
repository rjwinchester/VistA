 The HDIG validates the objects associated with these classes and stores
 them in the new database.
  
 Each SOP class must be enabled individually to be stored. The patch 
 is distributed with all SOP classes disabled as the default. To enable
 the storage of SOP classes, please enter a CA ticket, or contact
 the National Help Desk to request assistance from the CLIN3 support team.
  
 NOTE: Supported SOP Classes are not currently viewable with Clinical Display 
 or VISTA RAD. 
  
 SOP Classes Newly Supported in MAG*3.0*185
 SOP Class Name                           SOP Class UID
 Enhanced CT Image Storage                1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.2.1

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 1. Rational Defect 651417: Incorrect Value Setting in VIX.Viewer.config file
 Problem:
 A defect for the new Image Viewer has been identified during testing with 
 JLV. The value of Security.EnablePromiscuousMode was enabled by default in
 MAG*3.0*177. This is a security defect in that if a user copies and
 manually shares the image viewer URL, any other user is able to display the
 patient image/exam with that URL, bypassing JLV and any other user specific
 authentication. 
 Resolution: 
 Correct value was set in MAG*3.0*185 release. 
 (<add name="Security.EnablePromiscuousMode" value="false" />)
  
 2. Rational Defect 608576: Image Viewer Unresponsive due to SQL Timeout
 Problem: 
 Users experience query time outs because image caches were full.
 Resolution: 
 A power shell script that empties the cache was implemented in this build 
 and executes automatically based on the file size. 
  
 Test Sites:
 Puget Sound, WA
 San Diego, CA

 Back-out or Uninstalling MAG*3.0*185
  
 If it is necessary to uninstall the MAG*3.0*185 VIX service, use the
 Uninstall option from Windows Control Panel to uninstall: "VIX Service
 Installation Wizard 30.185.8.6060".
  
 Then install the previous version of VIX which was included in MAG*3.0*170
 or 177. To back-out the VIX and replace it with prior version, please see
 the MAG*3.0*185 VIX Installation Guide for more detail. 
  
 However, if it is necessary to uninstall the MAG*3.0*185 Vist KIDS, you
 need to select the "Kernall Installation & Distribution System" menu
 option, "Backup a Transport Global" (see KID installation section above, 
 step 4), before you uninstall the patch. 
  
 Administrators will need to use the PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE.
 Check your VistA MailMan messages for the backup message sent by the
 "Backup a Transport Global" function by following these steps. 
  
 1. Select the inbox message shown below. 
  
 Backup of MAG*3.0*185 install on <mm dd,yyyy>   <user name>
  
 2. Select the Xtract PackMan option. 
 3. Select the Install/Check Message option
 4. Enter "Yes" at the prompt. 
 5. Enter "No" at the backup prompt. There is no need to back up the backup.

 Warning: Installing this message will cause a permanent update of globals
 and routines. 
 Do you really want to do this? NO// YES<Enter>
  
 Routines are the only parts that are backed up. NO other parts are backed 
 up, not even globals. You may use the 'Summarize Message' option of
 PackMan to see what parts the message contains. Those parts that are not
 routines should be backed up separately if they need to be preserved. 
  
 Shall I preserve the routines on disk in a separate back-up message? 
 YES// NO
 No backup message built.
