Subject: GROUP POINTER ISSUE IMPORT OCX

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 This Patch fixes an Issue with the VistA Imaging Import API OCX.
 Issue:  when a site imports multiple images with the intention of linking 
 the Image Group to a TIU Note,  the Import is successful, but the Image 
 Group is not Linked to the TIU Note.
 The Fix is in the Import API OCX.  This OCX is used by the Background 
 Processor when the Import Queue is processed.   
 This Patch will Unregister the existing OCX,  install and Register the 
 New OCX (MagImportXControl1.ocx) in the ...\vista\imaging\lib   folder on 
 the BackGround Processor machine.  
 This Patch is only for the Background processor(s) at the sites.
