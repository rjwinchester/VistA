 Associated Patches:
 ==================
 The ability to use Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) was released in 
 the MAG*3.0*135 Background Processor Maintenance patch and must be 
 installed in order to use FQDN.  Also, MAG*3.0*146 must be implemented 
 after MAG*3.0*158, due to an abstract creation issue.
  
 This patch is informational only and provides additional information that 
 sites may use to implement the use of FQDNs.

 Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)

 Description:
 ===========
 As part of the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) Server Elimination
 Project, WINS functionality will be disabled by removing the Network Basic
 Input/Output System (NetBIOS) protocol from all VA systems.  To prepare
 for this, all sites will be required to switch their network location
 entries over to Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs).  This informational
 patch provides an explanation of an FQDN, describes how it works, and
 provides instructions for sites to update their network location entries
 to FQDNs and verifies proper functionality of VistA Imaging components
 when using FQDNs.  Additionally, as part of this patch, VistA Imaging was
 tested to insure that it operates normally with NetBIOS removed.
  
 What is an FQDN?
 ================
 An FQDN is the complete domain name for a specific computer (host) on the 
 Internet. It consists of both host name and domain name. Combined, they 
 provide enough information for the Domain Name System (DNS) to identify a 
 computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address. 
  
 To further explain, the host name references a specific computer, whereas 
 the domain name references the network from a particular organization.  
 For example, an FQDN for a hypothetical mail server might be 
 mymail.vhaiswmail.gov.  The host name is mymail located within the domain 
 name vhaiswmail.gov. The FQDN acts as an alias for the IP address (such as
 192.168.1.1), a complex string of numbers that computers, 
 servers and devices, use to identify one another online.
  
 Why use an FQDN?
 ================
 Since IP addresses are so complex, it is easier for users to remember 
 host names and domain names.  The best way for a user to connect to a 
 host is to specify the FQDN (the host name plus domain name).  The DNS 
 takes that information and searches the DNS table for the specific IP 
 address and returns it. 
  
 If the user attempts to connect to a server with only the host name (no 
 domain), then the DNS might fail to locate the IP address if the host is 
 outside the user's searchable domain.  Supplying the host's FQDN will 
 enable the DNS to locate the server without delay.
  
 The legacy method of locating machines across Veterans Integrated 
 Service Networks (VISNs) and Regions without the FQDN involved the use of
 WINS.  By pointing all clients to a collection of national WINS servers in
 the VA, machines could resolve each other's IP addresses regardless of
 which domain they reside in.  This has allowed Imaging to reach machines
 with only the machine name in the path, so Imaging has not needed a full
 path to the machine name.  The VA however is phasing out WINS in favor or
 DNS.  To facilitate this transition, it is necessary to ensure that all
 paths in the Imaging Network Location file use FQDNs, to allow name
 resolution via DNS.
  
 Note:  Some applications use the Import API to pass through the 
 Background Processor (BP) - images Import Queue.  These applications are 
 still using Universal Naming Convention (UNC) rather than FQDN and are 
 configured/setup outside of the VistA Imaging environment, for example: 
 -Clinical Procedures package 
 -Patient Image Capture System (PICS) Medical Intensive Care Unit 
 (MICU) Flowsheet (Sto Interface-) VA application that creates flowsheets).
 -Commercial application, Document Storage Systems (DSS) DocManager
 -Commercial application, iMedConsent
 -Veterans ID Card PICS
  
 The site might have to perform the walk-around before they perform the 
 FQDN option from their own API.

 Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ====================
 The following help desk calls and defect numbers are addressed in this
 patch:
   INC 000588369 - FQDN - cannot view image from remote site 
  
 Problem 1:
 =========
 This patch provides instruction to allow sites to convert the network 
 paths of their Network Location entries from hostname only references to 
 the FQDN reference.
  
 The legacy method of resolving machine names in network paths has been 
 accomplished via a combination of DNS and WINS.  When the hostname in the 
 path is beyond the DNS scope of the caller, the caller would fall to WINS 
 to resolve the name.  The VA is phasing out WINS, so sites need to use 
 FQDNs in their network paths in the Imaging NETWORK LOCATION file 
 (#2005.2) PHYSICAL REFERENCE field (#1) to ensure the hostname will be 
 resolvable by any device.
  
 Resolution 1:
 ============
 How can I convert to FQDN? 
 To convert to FQDN, first, all online physical references in the Imaging 
 NETWORK LOCATION file (#2005.2) should be updated from simple machine 
 names to FQDNs.  This includes Tier 1 locations, Tier 2 locations, 
 Diagrams (if used), Routing locations, and EKG locations.
  
 The FQDN at the medical centers normally includes the VISN, aka 
 Vxx.domain.ext. For example: Huntington's cluster is
 VHAHUNCLU2A.V09.DOMAIN.EXT 
  
 Hostname.Vyy.DOMAIN.EXT - (should be standard where "yy" is the VISN 
 number) 
  
 For the Imaging Network Location entry, be sure to use both host name and 
 domain name, as shown below:
  
 Host Name       + Domain Name   = FQDN
 VHAxxxCLU4      Vyy.domain.ext  VHAxxxCLU4.Vyy.domain.ext
 VHAxxxIMMJB1    Vyy.domain.ext  VHAxxxIMMJB1.Vyy.domain.ext
  
 xxx = 3 character site code, and yy=VISN number
  
 Please consult your local VHA network team for the correct FQDNs. 
  
 To edit the NETWORK LOCATION file (#2005.2), follow instructions in the 
 VistA Imaging Installation Guide, Section 2.4.5.1 (see the Supporting 
 Documentation section above).  In Step 4, be sure to enter the FQDN (full 
 path) in the Network Share field.
  
 Verifying that the Change to FQDN Works
 When the path is entered, press "Apply", then click "Properties" to 
 verify the information, as shown below.  If the value is correct and the 
 path is visible to the Background Processor, the pie chart display should 
 indicate used and free space.  If it does not, re-check the value before 
 continuing to the next entry.
  
  
  
 Problem 2:  
 =========
 Sites will be instructed to disable NetBIOS on all workstations and 
 servers.  VistA Imaging must be tested to operate with the NetBIOS 
 removed.
  
 Resolution 2:
 ============
 VistA Imaging was tested to insure that it operates normally with NetBIOS 
 removed.
