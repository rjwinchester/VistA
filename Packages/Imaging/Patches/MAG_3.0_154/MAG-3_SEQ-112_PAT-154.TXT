Description:
============

 This Background Processor (BP) maintenance patch resolves several issues when 
 the BP processes image files from the VistA Imaging operation or when the user 
 sets up the BP parameters.
  
 This patch does not update the client version of the Background Processor. The 
 BP client version will remain at 135.  The features and fixes of MAG*3.0*154 
 are summarized below:
  
 Distribution of Software
 To obtain MAG*3.0*154 files, use File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to retrieve 
 MAG3_0P154.KID and other files from one of the following OI Field Offices' 
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directories:

 The following Remedy help desk calls are addressed in this patch:
 1. 334440- Increase data field value 2005.2 fields #2, #3, #4 for storage space 
           (14 digits).
 2. 522145- Doesn't allow same network path name for GE MUSE EKG type server.
 3. 595732- Background Processor (BP) Monitor task produced the error 
            <SUBSCRIPT>BPMSG+12^MAGQCBP.
 4. 981009- Fix queue numbers being assigned duplicates to new IMPORTs.
 5. 968693- Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) create the error when the BP Verifier
            is attempting to clear an image.
 6. 996668- The user needs to be able to enter a fractional purge factor.
 7. 1065099- If an image is on a Jukebox platter that has been marked offline, 
             it cannot be copied by the Import API (watermarking Rescinded 
             Advanced Directives image).
  
 NSRs
 There are no new service requests addressed in this patch.
  
 Patient Safety Issues
 There are no patient safety issues associated with this patch.
  
 This patch addresses minor issues with the VistA Imaging Background
 Processor (BP).  It will: 
 1. Allow a fractional purge factor to effectively control data storage space 
    and enlarge the Data Dictionary numeric values that reflect total space, 
    used space, and free space data elements.
 2. Fix the MUSE network location setup issue for multi-divisions.
 3. Correct an erroneous parameter being passed when the BP is searching for the
    VistA Institution file.
 4. Eliminate duplicate Import queue numbers.
 5. Correct archive image pointer references.
 6. Add the ability to enter a fractional purge factor.
 7. Fix the Import API to handle watermarking for Rescinded Advanced Directives
    images on a Jukebox platter and marked as offline.  (Image is not available.)
  
 Issue 1 Summary
 Data Dictionary storage values that define the amount of space for different 
 repositories were too small.  The data dictionary limited the amount of space 
 that could be allocated because of the size for the field.  The values need to
 be expanded to allow increased capacity.  
  
 Solution 1
 The Data Dictionary (DD) field values for 2005.2 fields #2, #3, and #4 were
 increased for the storage space value, to accept 14 decimal digits for terabyte
 storage (modify INPUT TRANSFORM).
   
 Issue 2 Summary
 The Network Manager (menu option from the BP) does not allow the same network 
 path name to be entered for the GE MUSE EKG type server for different sites 
 that share the same GE MUSE server.
  
 Solution 2
 If the server type is "EKG," the Input Transform Utility (CHKNET^MAGQBUT6) was
 changed to accept a duplicate server name.  The PHYSICAL REFERENCE (full 
 network path) will now accept duplicate MUSE server names for sites sharing the
 same MUSE server (i.e., VISN or Regional) by using the VA FileMan/Edit option. 
 A GUI fix will come later in a BP patch.)
  
 Issue 3 Summary
 The BP Monitor task produces the following error when the schedule Verifier is 
 running:  <SUBSCRIPT>BPMSG+12^MAGQCBP.  There is no adverse effect other than
 the error message displaying in the error log.
  
 Solution 3
 The M code was modified to verify that either the station number or the 
 institution ID (in routine: MAGQCBP) is in place.
     S SITE=$P($G(^MAG(2006.1,PLACE,0)),U,1) 
     S:(SITE'="") SITE=$$LKUP^XUAF4(SITE) ;Get Division #
     S TMP=$$GET1^DIQ(4,SITE,.01,"E") 
  
 Issue 4 Summary
 When new images were being imported using the Background Processor, they were 
 sometimes being assigned duplicate queue numbers.  As a result, the image would
 sometimes not match or not be found, an error would be produced and the image 
 would not be imported.  The IMAGE BACKGROUND QUEUE POINTER (^MAGQUEUE(2006.031))
 was (by mistake or corruption) reset to much lower than the last queue number 
 that was used.
  
 Solution 4
 The M code was added in the routine QUEUE^MAGBAPI to check the existing queue 
 entry and to ensure that the queue number is unique.
  
 Issue 5 Summary
 The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) creates the error in the error trap when the BP 
 Verifier is attempting to clear an invalid pointer reference for an archived 
 image.
  
 Solution 5
 The MAGQBPG1 code was updated to successfully handle the invalid file reference.
  
 Issue 6 Summary
 If the purge factor is set to "1," then the auto purge triggers whenever the 
 available storage space of Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is less 
 or equal to the defined (low) watermark.  This is the same event that would 
 trigger a RAID group- a method of grouping hard drive space- to advance and, 
 therefore, it is too late to prepare the next RAID group for its pending role.  
 When the user sets the purge factor to "2," the purge occurs several times 
 before the RAID group moves; when set to "1," the purge occurs after the move.  
 The user needs to be able to enter a fractional purge factor to allow more 
 effective management of data storage.
  
 Solution 6
 This required Data Dictionary and code changes to allow for a decimal purge fact
 or.  When the user sets the Purge Factor, they are now able to enter a 
 fractional purge factor.
  
 Issue 7 Summary
 If an image is on a Jukebox platter that had been marked offline, it cannot be 
 copied by the Import API and watermarked (according to the rescinded Advanced 
 Directive).  An error report is generated and the image does not get updated 
 as a rescinded image but is marked as deleted.
  
 Solution 7
 The M code routine MAGGSIU5 was edited to notify the user that the image is 
 located on an offline platter and to instruct them to contact Imaging staff to 
 get the image online.

 and schedule the updates to occur during non-operational hours.
  
 Installation Prerequisites
 ==========================
 Before installing this patch, users will need to download the MAG*3.0*154 files 
 from the Download Server to a local storage location.  Verify that the patches 
 listed in the section Associated Patches have been previously installed.
