 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1. Task 610713:  Adaptive Maintenance: Delphi Upgrade
 Problem:  
 This task upgrades the development environment for the 
 Background Processor from Delphi 7 to Delphi XE8. Per the TRM, the
 Background Processor was out of compliance with the latest approved
 version of Delphi.
  
 Resolution:  
 The version of Delphi used to build the BP has been upgraded to Delphi 
 XE8.
  
 2.  Defect 590807 (Ticket # I15862932FY17) Eval Queue Counter not 
 Decrementing Correctly
 Problem:  
 A site was receiving "VI_BP_Eval_Queue" email alerts related to Routing.  
 Their EVAL Queue had climbed above 41,000 images.  The IMAGE BACKGROUND
 QUEUE POINTER file (2006.031) has an individual entry that keeps a running
 counter of the number of items in the EVAL Queue.  When an EVAL entry is
 removed from 2006.3, the counter was not being decremented correctly, so
 the count continued to rise.
  
 Resolution: 
 This fix, introduced by a Clin 3 support specialist, corrected the code 
 so that the counter increments and decrements properly, which will stop
 the erroneous emails.
  
  
 3.  Defect 590810 (Ticket #R16232234FY17) BP Process Delay with JUKEBOX 
 Queue 
  
 Problem: 
 The Background Processor has a one second delay after processing a 
 JUKEBOX queue. This delay limits the maximum number of images written per
 day to 86,400. Gainesville exceeds 100K new images accumulated per day.
 The Verifier needed to run over the weekend to keep the queue low enough
 so that the DELETE queue could  be processed.
  
 Resolution:  
 An option has been added to the Background Processor to enable the user 
 to choose the length of the delay. The option has selectable delay times
 that are fractions of a second.
  
 On the BP Main window, there is a new panel to the left of the Start
 button.  It shows the time of day.
  
 If the user double-clicks on the time of day, a panel with a list of 
 selectable delays will show. The user will not have to stop the BP. The
 entries in the list are in milliseconds (ms). When the BP is started, 1000
 ms is selected.  The user can select a different delay to speed up
 the processing of queues.        
  
 Also, the Delay pane can be shown by clicking on the menu option : Edit | 
 Set Queue pause (delay)
  
 If there are "0" active queues,  the phrase "(0 Active)"  will be 
 displayed and the delay will change to 3 seconds. When there are active
 queues, the "(0 Active)" will be hidden, and the delay will change back to
 what is selected in the Delay drop down list.     
  
  
 Note: 
 =====
 The time of day has been added as a visual indicator that the BP is 
 running and isn't hung or frozen.  The time of day is updated every second
 (or every 3 seconds if there are 0 active queues).
  
 The time of day will switch between being underlined and not underlined 
 every time the BP checks VistA for queues to process as another visual
 indicator that the BP is running. The entries in the list of queues will
 not be highlighted and will not flash anymore as the list is updated.
  
  
 4.  Defect 590811 (Ticket # R16379827FY17) Queue Processor Requeue Window 
 is Too Large to Show Buttons
  
 Problem:  
 The buttons on the Queue Processor Requeue window are partially hidden 
 when the window opens. The users have to scroll up or downto see them.
 Also, the physical location that is displayed in certain columns is not
 fully visible and the columns do not resize correctly. Some windows opened
 from the Edit menu do not show the Apply/Save buttons unless the window is
 maximized.
  
 Resolution:  
 The Queue Processor Requeue window has been modified so that all buttons 
 are visible when it opens. Other windows and lists in the BP application
 have been modified so that all buttons are visible and columns can be
 resized to show the entire text of the column entry.
  
 Examples:
  
 The Popup menu enables users to resize all columns to fit the Header or 
 Text Width.
 Edit boxes will resize when the window is resized.
  
  
 5.  Defect 454040 (Ticket # I9406546FY16) Unable to Edit VistA Site 
 Service Physical Reference in BP
 Problem:  
 When the user is attempting to edit the URL for the VistA Site Service in 
 the BP Network Location Manager, the physical reference entry for the
 VistA site service is prepended with "C:\xxxx\xxxx" and will not let the
 user remove it and edit the URL. Also, this error is received when the
 user attempts to add a URL.  After the user enters the URL and selects
 save, the Background Processor appends 'C:\xxxxx\xxx" to the beginning of
 the entry.
  
 Resolution:  
 This has been corrected.  The user can now enter and edit a URL in the 
 Network Share field for URLs in the Network Location Properties window.
  
 6. Defect 683800 (Ticket R18602766FY18)  BP HTML Log Files are not 
 formatted correctly, and are hard to review   
 Problem:
 The BP applications create many log files, and these files are saved in 
 HTML format. The HTML tags were incorrect resulting in every data value
 being written to a new line, instead of written to the appropriate column
 of the HTML Table.
  
 Resolution: 
 The code that generates the HTML Files was fixed.  Data values are now 
 displayed in the correct column.

 Patch Installation: 
 ===================
 IMPORTANT:  The client install process for Background Processor Patch 
 MAG*3.0*196 has changed.
 Do NOT uninstall MagBPSetup.exe (Patch 135) from the control panel, 
 because MAG*3.0*196 is not a complete client install.
 The client install for this patch will install additional executables, 
 Magbtm196.exe, MagPurge196.exe, MagVerifier196.exe and
 MagHTMLArchive196.exe in the c:\program files
 (x86)\vista\imaging\backproc\ folder. 
 MAG*3.0*135 will remain fully functional after the MAG*3.0*196 install. 
 After the client install, there will be two client executables in the 
 c:\program files (x86)\vista \imaging\backproc folder for the Background
 Processor, Verifier, Purge and HTML Archive applications.  The executables
 for MAG*3.0*196 have '196' appended to the name.
  
 Desktop Icons used in Patch 135 Desktop Icons used in Patch  196        
 Start Menu Background Processor Items
  
 Version control will change when the MAG*3.0*196 KIDS is installed. It 
 will be possible to open either magbtm.exe (MAG*3.0*135) or magbtm196.exe
 (MAG*3.0*196) and log onto VistA. This also applies to the Verifier and
 Purge applications. 
  
 NOTE: 
 =====
 There will be two Background Processor executables in the \backproc 
 folder, magbtm.exe and magbtm196.exe. Multiple instances of the BP Queue
 Processor can be opened at the same time, however, only one can be running
 at a time with the Start button pressed. 
 Pressing the Start 
  
 Button on two Background Processor applications on the same server will 
 cause problems.
  
 Summary: 
 ========
 The BP Client applications have been upgraded to a newer version of 
 Delphi.  All functions of the BP Queue Processor, Verifier and Purge will
 work as expected, but version control was changed as a safeguard against
 unexpected issues. 
 Version control for the Background Processor has been modified to allow 
 previous versions to log on. If issues occur while running the new
 MAG*3.0*196 BP, it will be easy for the user to switch back to the older
 MAG*3.0*135 BP.
 In case of issues while 196 is running, simply stop and close the BP, 
 then open and start the MAG*3.0*135 BP.
  
 Note: 
 =====
 When a user enters invalid Access/Verify Codes while logging into VistA, 
 the system gives them an error message.
  
 In patch 196, the Error message is hidden under the main Vista Sign-on 
 window. The user has to move the VistA Sign-on window, then click 'OK' in
 the Error message window to be able to continue. A fix for this issue is
 scheduled for a future Background Processor patch.
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ===============================
 MAG*3.0*196 KIDS must be installed on the VistA System prior to running 
 the executables. This patch must be installed by the compliance date.
  
 All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of this 
 patch.  This patch may be loaded while the VistA Imaging System is
 active.  Installation will take less than one minute.
  
 Important: 
 ==========
 Any Background Processor applications that are running must be stopped 
 and closed prior to the installation of the KIDS and Client software. Any
 image capture application (Clinical Capture and DICOM Gateway processing)
 can continue to run during the installation.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ==============================
 If a previous version of MAG*3.0*196 has been installed on the 
 workstation, it must be uninstalled before installing the new version.
 Verify that the patches listed in the Associated Patches section of this 
 document have been previously installed.  Any Background Processor task
 that is running (Queue Processor, Verifier, Purge) must be stopped
 (applications must be closed) prior to the installation of the KIDS file.
  
 However, any image capture application (Clinical Capture and DICOM 
 Gateway processing) can continue to operate.
  
 Note:  
 =====
 All released VistA Imaging patches must be installed on the VistA system 
 before installing MAG*3.0*196.

 Installing the Background Processor Client
 ==========================================
 The Background Processor client can be installed while the VistA System 
 is active. Installation takes less than two minutes.
  
 Important: 
 ==========
 Any Background Processor applications that are running must be stopped 
 and closed prior to the installation of the KIDS and Client software. Any
 image capture application (Clinical Capture and DICOM Gateway processing)
 can continue to run during the installation.
  
 For 64 bit OS installs: 
 =======================
 Log into the BP Server as an administrator.  For Step 2 below, use the 
 "Run as Administrator" option when installing BP storage software on a 64
 bit Windows OS, such as Windows 2012 Server.
  
 To install the MAG*3.0*196  Background Processor client:
 ========================================================
 1) DO NOT remove any previously installed versions of the VistA Imaging 
 Background Processor.  
  
 The MAG*3.0*196 client is not a full install of the BP suite of 
 applications.  
 MAG*3.0*135 and MAG*3.0*158 must be installed before installing 
 MAG*3.0*196.
  
 If a previous version of MAG*3.0*196 has been installed on the 
 workstation, it must be uninstalled before installing the new version of
 MAG*3.0*196.
 Do not uninstall MagBPSetup (patch 135) and do not uninstall VistA 
 Imaging Background Processor Utilities (P158)
  
 2) Locate and run the MAG3_0P196Background_Processor_Setup.exe file. Use
 the "Run as Administrator" option when installing BP storage software on a
 64 bit Windows OS, such as Windows 2012 Server.
  
 3) When the InstallShield wizard runs, accept the program defaults and 
 click "Next" until the Ready to Install the Program dialog is displayed.
  
 4) Click "Install" to proceed with the installation. 
  
 5) When installation completes, click "Finish" to exit the installation 
 wizard. 
  
 6) Start the Background Processor (Start | Programs | VistA Imaging 
 Programs | Background Processor | Queue Processor 196). Then, choose Help
 | About to confirm that the software version is 30.51.196.nn.
  
 7) After installation of MAG*3.0*196, there should be three entries in 
 Control Panel | Programs for the Background Processor applications:
  
 MAG*3.0*135: MagBPSetup                                
 30.50.135.10
 MAG*3.0*158: VistA Imaging Background Processor Utilities 
 (P158)                30.50.158.5
 MAG*3.0*196: VistA Imaging Background Processor 196                     
 30.51.196.4 
  
 New Server Installation
 =======================
 If the installation is on a server that does not have a previous version 
 of the Background Processor, both, MAG*3.0*135 and MAG*3.0*158, must be
 installed first. Then MAG*3.0*196 can be installed.
  
 Desktop shortcuts for the Purge, Verifier and  Background Processor 
 Queue Processor  are automatically created on the desktop.
  
 If installing the BP Queue Processor, BP Verifier, and BP Purge on a 
 64-bit operating system such as Windows 2012 Server,  "Run as
 administrator" must be manually set using the check box in the Advanced
 Properties window on each of the desktop shortcuts and the menu 
 options. Do this for all three client applications.
  
 If the MAG*3.0*196 Background Processor client is installed before 
 installing the MAG*3.0*196 KIDS, a message will display when the client is
 run that says the versions of the Background Processor client and the
 version of the VistA Imaging host system are not compatible.  The user
 will be prompted to install compatible versions of the Background 
 Processor client and the VistA system host software.  If such a message
 displays, complete the following 
 steps: 
  
 1)       Shut down the Background Processor client. 
 2)       Install the MAG*3.0*196 KIDS. 
 3)       Now run the MAG*3.0*196 Background Processor client. 
  
  
 NOTE:  
 =====
 Because version checking in this patch allows the previous BP 135 client, 
 users are able to start BP 135 up prior to the KIDs install.  Remember to
 stop and close it while the KIDS file is being installed.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 ===============================
 Restart all Background Processor applications that were stopped for 
 installation.
  
 Installing, Updating and Uninstalling the Background Processor
 ==============================================================
 Client Uninstall: 
 =================
 Because of the change in version control which enables the previous 
 version of the Background Processor to run and log onto VistA, it is not
 necessary to immediately uninstall the 196 client if issues occur.  
 MAG*3.0*196 BP (magbtm196.exe) can be stopped and closed and the previous
 Background Processor MAG*3.0*135 (magbtm.exe) can be started and  used.  
  
 For additional information on installing, updating, or uninstalling the 
 Background Processor, refer to the Background Processor User Guide.
  
 KIDS Uninstall:
 ===============
 Note: 
 =====
 The previous KIDS Patch for the Background Processor was MAG*3.0*186. 
 Patch 186 only included a KIDS install and did not change the client
 application.  
 The previous client version of the Background Processor is MAG*3.0*135.
  
 If it is necessary to uninstall the MAG*3.0*196 VistA KIDS, select the 
 "Kernel Installation & Distribution System" menu option, "Backup a
 Transport Global". (See Installation Steps section, Step 4c; this must be
 done before the patch is installed).
  
 Administrators will need to use the PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK 
 MESSAGE. Check your MailMan messages for the backup message sent by the
 "Backup a Transport Global" function executed prior to the patch install.
  
 1.       Select the message shown below:
  
 Backup of MAG*3.0*196 install on <mmm dd, yyyy>    <user name>
  
 2.      Select the Xtract PackMan option.
 3.      Select the Install/Check Message option.
 4.      Enter "Yes" at the prompt.
 5.      Enter "No" at the backup prompt.  There is no need to back up the 
 backup.
