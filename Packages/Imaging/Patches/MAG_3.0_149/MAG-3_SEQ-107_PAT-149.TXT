Subject: CLINICAL DISPLAY PRINTING ISSUES

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the issues dealing with the Quality of Printing
 PDF, and DICOM Encapsulated PDF images from the Clinical Display Client.
  
 When Patch 131 was installed some of the printed PDF images are now
 blurry, distorted when printed. Most of these same images print fine when
 printed with Clinical Display Client 122.
  
 Also the renaming of menu items concerning 'Controlled Images' for easier
 understanding by user.
  
 Distribution of Software

 MAG3_0P149.KID and other files from one of the following OI Field

 MAG*3.0*149 Changes
 =================== 
 Menu Option Summary
  
 Contained within the Clinical Display application, there are menu options 
 on the Image List window that give the user the ability to change the 
 'Controlled' status of an Image. Controlled Images are images that may be 
 of a sensitive nature. Controlled images open the same as other images. 
 The difference is that the image list entry for controlled images has a 
 warning icon and the abstract (thumbnail) for the image has a warning 
 symbol rather than a small representation of the Image.
  
 Issue Summary
  
 Some users are confused by the current wording of the menu items and feel 
 the wording is not intuitive. 
  
 Solution
  
 The 'True' and 'False' words are taken out of the menu options and 
 replaced with the descriptive text associated with the Controlled status. 
 The wording of the menu options will be changed.
 From :
 => False (Normal Display)
 => True (Controlled Display) 
  
 To:
 Not Controlled (Normal Display)
 Controlled Display 
  
 Print function Summary
  
 In Clinical Display, images had always been printed the same way 
 ('referred to as Normal') until MAG*3.0*131. In MAG*3.0*131, PDF images 
 were rasterized before printing. Rasterization is used to convert vector 
 graphics that are part of an image to a bitmap representation of the 
 graphic. This is necessary in situations where annotations are being 
 printed with the image. 
  
 Issue summary
  
 Users have reported that some PDF images are fuzzy, blurry or granular 
 when printed. Also, the image being displayed in Clinical Display becomes 
 blurry after printing.
  
 Issue details
  
 MAG*3.0*131 modified the Print Function of VistA Imaging Display. The 
 change was to rasterize all Adobe PDF documents before printing. The 
 displayed image is rasterized and redisplayed and the newly displayed 
 image is the source of the printed image.
  
 In some Adobe PDF documents that have graphic data, the rasterization of 
 the graphic causes the image to be granulated (fuzzy). The fuzziness is 
 apparent on both the displayed image and the printed image.
  
 Sites report that the same images printed okay in the previous clinical 
 display client, MAG*3.0*122. 
  
 Solution
  
 The solution is two parts. 
  
 First, change the print function back to the design of MAG*3.0*122. This 
 will print all images normal as they were printed in MAG*3.0*122.
  
 Second, introduce a Print Options window. This window will give users the 
 ability to view the image in normal mode and converted to Bitmap. The 
 user can view the image in both modes and select the best mode for 
 printing. 
  
 VistA Imaging Display Client changes (VI Display)
  
 In the Imaging Display Client, the print function will be changed back to 
 the design of MAG*3.0*122. When the print option is selected, images will 
 be printed normal.
  
 A new menu option will be available on the 'File' menu of the Image List, 
 Full Resolution and Radiology Viewer windows. The new option will be 
 directly under the 'Image Print' Option.

 When MAG*3.0*149 is released, the list of supported versions of Clinical
