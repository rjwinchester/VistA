 Subject:  CLINICAL CAPTURE ISSUES
 ======
  
 Category:  OTHER
 =======
  
 Description:
 =========
 MAG*3.0*189 resolves the following issues for the Clinical Capture Client:
  
  Duplicate images are captured. When capturing images, it is possible to 
 click the Capture button again, before the current image capture has
 completed. This results in the same image being captured twice to the
 Study Group.
  
  Telederm Consults do not display.  The lists of Telederm Consults are 
 not displayed when the user clicks the Select Telederm Consult button.
  
  Patient not synchronizing without Clinical Context Object Workgroup 
 (CCOW).  This issue was reported by Indian Health Service (IHS) users.  
 The patient in Clinical Capture does not synchronize when a new patient is
 selected in the IHS Electronic Health Record (EHR).  This issue will occur
 at VA Sites if CCOW is not running.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 1.      Defect 585354 (Trouble Ticket I16213216FY17) Capture Button 
 Selected Multiple Times and Defect 453724 (Trouble Ticket I6044024FY16)
 Clinical Capture not Correctly Uploading
 For this item, multiple problems were solved with the same solution.  
 They are detailed below: 
 Problem 1 (585354):  The Clinical Capture button
 can be selected multiple times and the default saving setting is Study
 (Group) as opposed to Single.
 Problem 2 (453724):   The Clinical Capture attempts do not correctly 
 upload.  An image stub is in VistA that shows in Clinical Display (as a
 second image to the image group).
 The user will try to open the image, is informed it does not exist and is 
 advised to call Information Resource Management (IRM).  On the Verifier,
 the image shows as file size zero but is not correctly removed from the
 IMAGE (2005) File.
  
 Resolution: The problem results from the fact that the Capture and Image 
 OK buttons remain enabled during the capture process, and that the image
 is being saved to a study group.  A user can accidentally click the
 Capture button a second time before the current capture process has
 finished.
  
 Note:  Two results occur because of this issue.
 ====
 First, the same image is successfully captured twice.  This results in 
 two of the same images being stored in the study group.  One of the
 duplicate images needs to be manually deleted from the patient record.
  
 Second, the same image is both successfully and unsuccessfully captured.  
 In this situation, the image entry for the unsuccessful capture does not
 get cleared by the Verifier.  An image stub remains in the IMAGE (2005)
 File.  The Verifier issue is not fixed in this patch.
  
 In Patch 189, the Capture and Image OK buttons are correctly disabled 
 during the capture process.  This will stop the possibility of
 accidentally capturing the same image twice.
  
 New Configuration Utility:
 =========================
 In this patch, a new utility is available, which will enable the user to 
 change all configuration buttons at once.  The utility will change the
 saving property of the configuration from "Saving: Study Group" to
 "Saving: Single Image".  See Configuration Utility in the next section.
  
 2.      Defect 573105 (Trouble Ticket I15833209FY17 & I15836535FY17) 
 Teledermatology not Working after Upgrade
  
 Problem:  The button to select a Telederm Consult does not work.  When 
 clicked, it blinks or flashes but the Telederm Consult selection list does
 not display.
  
 Note: This issue was reported in Clinical Capture MAG*3.0*178.
 ==== 
  
 Resolution:  The Telderm Consult window is fixed and now correctly 
 displays as designed.
  
 3.      Defect 548548 (Trouble Ticket I15201996FY17) Patient Selections 
 not Updating
 Problem:  This issue was reported by Indian Health Services (IHS).  When 
 the patient is changed in the EHR (CPRS), the patient does not update in
 Clinical Capture.
  
 Resolution:  The patient synchronization between Clinical Capture and EHR 
 (IHS) has been fixed.  The patient in Clinical Capture will now correctly
 change to the patient selected in EHR.
  
 Note:  
 ====
 If CCOW is not running at VA sites, and the Clinical Capture client was 
 started from the CPRS tools menu, then the patient in Clinical Capture
 will correctly change to the patient selected in CPRS.
  
 Configuration Utility:
 =====================
 Overview:  One of the property settings saved with all configuration 
 buttons is the Saving As property.  This property defines whether the
 captured images are saved as a part of a study (Group) or as a single
 image.
 When a single image is to be associated with the package report, (i.e., 
 TIU Note), then Single Image should be used.  This is generally the
 setting for document scanning and includes saving a multiple page document
 as a single image, such as a PDF.  Study (Group) should only be used when
 multiple images are associated with the same package report.
 Generally, this is the setting for importing images, such as digital 
 photographs.  A special situation occurs when only one image is saved in a
 Study (Group); this is referred to as a group of one.  Although a group of
 one will work, extra processing is required by Imaging functions in
 Clinical Capture, Display and the Background Processor.
  
 Also, the user has extra steps to complete when capturing to an image 
 group.  A group of one has been known to cause issues with Clinical
 Display and the Background Processor and most recently with Clinical
 Capture. The Imaging team strongly recommends that the Saving option be
 changed to Single Image instead of Study (Group) and that the existing
 Configuration Buttons on the workstation be changed to Single Image
 instead of Study (Group).
  
 Note:  
 ====
 Prior to MAG*3.0*189 the default setting for saving was Study (Group).  
 For workstations that have not had previous versions of Clinical Capture
 installed, the default setting will be Single Image after installing
 MAG*3.0*189.
  
 A new utility in the Clinical Capture client enables the user to change 
 all existing configurations from Study (Group) to Single Image.
  
 Running the Utility:
 Run the utility from the Clinical Capture main window menu:  
 Configurations | Modify Configurations: change Group to Single
 A confirmation window will display showing counts of existing 
 configurations.
  
 Click "OK."      
 The result will be displayed as a message at the bottom of the main 
 window.  Optionally, you can verify that the changes were implemented by
 running the utility again. Now, as shown on the right, there are no
 configurations defined as an Image Group.
  
  
 Changing from Single Image to Study (Group):
 If a site does capture multiple images to a Study (Group), you can modify 
 and save an existing configuration button.
  
 To modify the existing configuration, follow the directions below:
 Click an existing configuration button that has Saving set to Single.
                                                 
 The configuration will be applied to the properties and fields of the 
 Clinical Capture main window.    
  
 Change from Single Image to Study (Group).
  
 Click "OK."      
  
 Now save the configuration.      
 The Save Configuration dialog window will display.  The button's name 
 should be displayed, but if it's not, retype the name exactly as it
 displayed on the button before you modified it.
  
 Click "OK." 
 Click "OK" to overwrite the existing configuration.
