 Description:
 ============
  
 MAG*3.0*203 provides the fix for the TeleReader issue caused from the 
 installation of MAG*3.0*180 where the remote site was having problems
 reading the Inter-Facility Consults. When the user tries to complete the
 Text Integration Utility (TIU) note, the system kicks the user out of
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and a subscript error is
 displayed. 
  
 Note: 
 =====
 Telereader sites that have either backed out MAG*3.0*180 or waited to 
 install MAG*3.0*180 should install MAG*3.0*203 directly after the install
 of Patch MAG*3.0*180.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1. Defect 650471 (CA Ticket R18062198FY18) Telereader issue with Inter- 
 Facility Consults
  
 Problem:
 After MAG*3.0*180 was installed, some reading sites started experiencing 
 issues with Inter-Facility consults. When the user completes the TIU note
 and attempts to sign the note, the system would kick the user out of CPRS
 with the subscript error. Code was added in MAG*3.0*180 to limit the
 number of phone numbers sent in Health Level 7 (HL7) message for ordering
 provider. 
 This adversely affected the Inter - Facility Consult(IFC) when a reading
 site has an incorrect entry in #2006.5831 causing an extra HL7 message
 with a Null IEN. 
  
 Resolution:
 This patch will replace the direct global read with a fileman call. This 
 will resolve the <SUBSCRIPT>PHONE+11^MAGDHOW3 error.
  
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 The following sites are test sites for this patch:
   VA Puget Sound Health Care System
   Raymond G. Murphy VA Medical Center (Albuquerque)
   Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center (Indianapolis)

 1.       Select the message shown below:
 Backup of MAG*3.0*203 install on <mmm dd, yyyy>    <user name>
 2.      Select the Xtract PackMan option.
 3.      Select the Install/Check Message option.

 Warning:  
 ========
 Installing this message will cause a permanent update of globals and 
 routines.
 Do you really want to do this? NO// YES<Enter>
  
 Routines are the only parts that are backed up.  NO other parts
 are backed up, not even globals.  You may use the 'Summarize Message'
 option of PackMan to see what parts the message contains.
 Those parts that are not routines should be backed up separately
 if they need to be preserved.
  
 Shall I preserve the routines on disk in a separate back-up message? 
 YES// NO
 No backup message built.
