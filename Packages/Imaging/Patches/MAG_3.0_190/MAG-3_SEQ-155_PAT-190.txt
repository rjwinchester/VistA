 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1.  Task 561265 - Upgrade LDGW to meet 2017c DICOM Standard 
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 The existing VistA Imaging Legacy DICOM Gateway ELEMENT.DIC, TEMPLATE.DIC,
 and UID.DIC dictionaries (MAG*3.0*162 and others) are based on the 2011
 version of the DICOM Standard. The DICOM Standard has progressed over the
 past six years and it is now necessary to update these dictionaries to the
 2017c version of the Standard, DICOM 2017c (July 2017).
 For more information on the DICOM Standard, refer to the DICOM website:
 http://www.dicomstandard.org/
  
 Resolution: 
 ===========
 VistA and Legacy DICOM Gateway code and files were updated to2017c Data 
 Dictionaries and VRs (Value Representations). 
  
 2.  Defect 420193 (Ticket I7126349FY16) Test Site (2-8-2 lockup on 
 VistA Reconnect)
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 When the Transmit DICOM Images to Storage SCP (Option 2-8-2) is running 
 on the Legacy DICOM Gateway and the Gateway needs to reconnect to VistA 
 after a disruption in service, it returns to the Select Sites menu option.
 This causes a disruption in service and a user intervention is required
 before the images will continue processing.
  
 Resolution: 
 ===========
 The reentry point is set in MAGDIWB. The reentry point had a default 
 timeout of 100000 seconds. The timeout was changed to 300 seconds, so 
 that the process can quickly resume without user intervention in 10 
 minutes (5 minute reconnect and 5-minute idle prompt time).
  
 3.  Defect 615043 (Ticket R12189070FY17 / R18263762FY18/ INC0183576) 
 DICOM Images are not getting transmitted through ROI from Clinical Display
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 Some of the DICOM Images are not getting transmitted through ROI from 
 Clinical Display. The images are selected in Clinical Display and sent to 
 a ROI device, but the images are not being transmitted to the device. 
 Sites are still able to transmit the images manually using the LDGW 2-8-1 
 option.
  
 Resolution: 
 ===========
 The accession number logic had been modified in P138 to support look up 
 in the lab/anatomic pathology package. This modification broke the
 accession look up for some consults. The MAGDRPC9 routine was modified to 
 fix the consult accession number look up.
  
 4.  Defect 601802 (Ticket R16534754FY17) Inactive router destinations
 being listed when starting the routing transmission process on the Legacy 
 DICOM Gateway
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 When starting the routing transmission process on the LDGW all the active 
 and inactive router destinations are listed. Users do not realize that 
 some of the destinations are inactive and select an inactive destination 
 causing images not to be routed.
  
 Resolution: 
 ===========
 A filter was added to MAG DICOM ROUTE LIST DESTI RPC to filter out
 inactive routing destinations.
  
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 The following sites are test sites for this patch:
         Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System (Biloxi)
         Fayetteville VA Medical Center
  
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ==================================================
 Software being released and/or documentation describing the new 
 functionality introduced by this patch are available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext. 
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may also 
 elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directory at the following OI Field Offices:
  
 Hines:          domain.ext  
 Salt Lake City: domain.ext
  
 Additional documentation may be found also be found on the VA Software 
 Documentation Library at:
 http://www4.domain.ext/vdl
  
 Note:   Information about last-minute changes to this patch will be 
 provided in a readme file. If present, this file will also be located in 
 the MAG3_0P190 directory.
  
  
 Patch Installation:
 ===================
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
  
 MAG*3.0*190 must be installed on the VistA System and on Legacy VistA 
 Imaging DICOM Gateways. This patch must be installed by the compliance 
 date to conform to VHA Directive 2001-023.
  
 All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of this 
 patch. This patch can be loaded while the VistA Imaging System is active 
 and users are on the system. Installing the MAG*3.0*190 KIDS takes 2-5 
 minutes.
  
 Note: 
 Sites must first install the KIDS portion followed immediately by the 
 DICOM Text Gateway(s).  The Legacy DICOM Image Gateways and Routing 
 Gateways can then be upgraded at the site's convenience.
  
 *Note: HDIGs still use Legacy DICOM Gateway for Image processing. They 
 should be upgraded as well at site's convenience.
  
 Note: All released VistA Imaging patches must be installed on the VistA 
 system before installing MAG*3.0*190.
  
  
 VistA System (KIDS) Installation 
 ================================
 Installation Steps 
 ==================
 The actual KIDS installation will take less than one minute.
 1. On the VistA system, access the Kernel Installation and 
 Distribution System Menu [XPD MAIN].
 2. Run the Installation option [XPD INSTALLATION MENU].
 3. Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
    a. Run the Load a Distribution option [XPD LOAD DISTRIBUTION] to 
       load the KIDS distribution.
    b. When prompted, enter the path and file name (MAG3_0P190.KID) of 
       the Patch 190 KIDS file.
    c. When prompted to continue with the load, enter "YES". A Distribution
    OK! message will be displayed when the load is complete.
 4  After loading the KIDS file, use the following options to verify 
    the contents of the patch and to back up any affected routines.
    a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global [XPD PRINT CHECKSUM] - Run this
       option if you want to ensure the integrity of the routines in the 
       patch.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System [XPD COMPARE TO SYSTEM] -
       Run this option if you want to view all changes that will be made
       when the patch is installed. All components (routines, options, and
       so on) in the patch will be compared.
    c. Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] - Run this option if you want
       to create a backup message of any routines exported with the patch. 
       It will NOT back up any of the other changes.
 5. After performing the load and any optional verification steps, install
    the KIDS file by performing the following steps:
    a. Run the Install Package(s) [XPD INSTALL BUILD] option.
    b. When prompted for the install name, enter "MAG*3.0*190".
    c. Answer "NO" to the following prompts:
  Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO//
  Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//
  Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO//
  
 6. When installation is finished, an Install Complete message will be
    displayed.
