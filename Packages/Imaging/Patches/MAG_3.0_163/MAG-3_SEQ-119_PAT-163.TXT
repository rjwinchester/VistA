Subject: MAG INDEX TERMS UPDATE

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 The MAG Index Terms are used in VistA Imaging Capture to index images, 
 which allows clinicians to apply sort filters when viewing or researching 
 images.  Sites must have the most recent index terms, otherwise they 
 might encounter issues when images are viewed across sites or within the 
 Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN).
 MAG*3.0*163 will update the current MAG VistA Imaging Index Term files 
 for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Indian Health Services 
 (IHS) sites accordingly. 
 MAG*3.0*163 is a MAG Index Term update patch which will add:
  
 1)  New Origin: URBAN (in CAPITAL letters), active for IHS sites only
  
 2) New Specialty :  Diagnostic Interventional Radiology 
 Abbreviation:  DIR

 3) New Specialty:  Radiation Oncology 
 Abbreviation:  RONC
 Associate with existing Procedure/Events:  Pain Management and

 4) New Specialty:  Physical Therapy, active for IHS sites only
