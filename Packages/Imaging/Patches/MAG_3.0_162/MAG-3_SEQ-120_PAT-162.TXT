 Description:
 ===========
 This document describes MAG*3.0*162, a patch that provides updates to the 
 Legacy Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Gateway 
 (LDGW) and the Hybrid DICOM Image Gateway (HDIG).  This patch addresses a 
 number of defects identified in Query/Retrieve and the HDIG including:  
 Storage Commit "MAG WORK ITEM" entries not purging, a MAG_DCMAbstract 
 timing issue, the DICOM Connectivity Framework (DCF) Listen configuration 
 file missing a few Service-Object Pair (SOP) Classes and a site-specific 
 accession number issue in Query/Retrieve.  Additionally, a new VistA 
 Imaging Exchange (VIX) install is being provided for inclusion in the 
 updates to the configuration file server.xml to improve Tomcat 
 performance for the mobile imaging application team.

 Problem 1:  VistA File "MAG WORK ITEM" Entries are not Purging as They
 ======================================================================
 Should
 ======
 The VistA file "MAG WORK ITEM" entries are not purging as they should, 
 specifically the "Storage Commit" entries in Patch 137.
  
 Resolution 1:  
 ============
 How the MAGVC WI LIST RPC (Remote Procedure Call) works was modified.  It 
 now supports two additional parameters (last IEN - Internal Entry Number 
 - number or records to return).  The RPC will no longer create a data 
 array of indefinite size if the number of records to return is 
 specified.  Modifications were made to the RPC, M-code, and HDIG.
  
 Problem 2:  Error with Imaging Service Account
 ==============================================
 The following errors were occurring in the VistA error trap.
  
 ZSTORE errors (running out of partition space):
   <STORE>^XWBTCPC
  
 The error is caused by the Patch 79 Storage Commitment.  The error 
 indicates that there was too much data stored locally in the partition 
 (i.e., not in ^TMP).  ACTLIST+38^MAGVCWIA is trying to build the RETURN 
 array and there are too many entries.
  
 Resolution 2:
 ============
 Both the M-Code and Java code were modified to implement  new RPC 
 parameters (WILIMIT and LASTIEN) to limit the number of Storage Commit 
 Work Item entries returned in the RPC Response.
  
 Problem 3:  MAG_DCMAbstract Timing Issue
 ========================================
 An error occurred where the MAG_DCMabstract occasionally could not create 
 an abstract for an image within a particular study.  It successfully uses 
 a canned.jpg instead.
  
 Resolution 3:
 ============
 The MAGDIR7C routine was updated on the Legacy DICOM Gateway (LDGW) to 
 include a one second hang after the deletion of the previous temporary 
 abstract and the creation of the new abstract.  
  
 Problem 4:  An Undefined Error Occurs in Query/Retrieve
 =======================================================
 Query/Retrieve is sometimes failing and an undefined error occurs.
   
 Resolution 4:
 ============
 In MAGDQR03, the V local array variable was being was being created 
 before the Study UID (Unique Identifier) element was set with the Study 
 UID, so after the embedded code segment was executed, the Study UID was 
 being lost.  Later, MAGDQR13 assumes that there is a Study UID defined 
 and attempts to access the element, even though it no longer exists and 
 an undefined error occurs.  The MAGDQR03 routine was modified to preserve 
 the V array.
  
 Problem 5:  HDIG Does not Properly Handle C-Store SCU Operations
 ================================================================
 During a Query/Retrieve operation, the HDIG plays the role of the C-Store 
 SCU (Service Class User).  The HDIG opens an Association with the C-Store 
 SCP (Service Class Provider)/third party provider and the HDIG then sends 
 1-to-many images to the C-Store SCP.  The HDIG was designed to be 
 resilient so if any one image fails, the HDIG will continue to send the 
 other images within the study.  However, one use case was not taken into 
 account.
  
 While sending an image, there was a network problem that generated 
 network IO errors/exceptions.  This exception did not necessarily come 
 from the C-Store SCP.  It is also possible that during this, the C-Store 
 SCP triggered an A-Abort to abort the Association.  The C-Store SCP 
 believes the Association no longer exists.  However, the HDIG still sees 
 an association and continues attempting to send images.  Eventually, the 
 HDIG times out because it does not receive any image sent responses from 
 the C-Store SCP.
  
 Resolution 5:
 ============
 Code was updated in the ImagingDicomRouter and ImagingDicomDCFSCU Java 
 projects.  The DICOM Storage SCU code was not properly notifying the 
 Command Router and the DICOM association was aborted.  This was corrected 
 with proper Exception handling. 
  
 Problem 6:  SOP Classes Missing in DCF Listen Configuration File 
 ================================================================
 Some newly supported SOP Classes were missing from the DCF Listen 
 configuration file:

 Resolution 6:
 ============
 The missing SOP Classes were added to the DCF Listen configuration file. 
  
 Problem 7:  Improper Matching When cPACS Sends Images with Only Case 
 ====================================================================
 Number
 ======
 Some cPACS are only using the Case# in the Accession# field. The HDIG 
 does not have the ability to match a Case number located in the Accession 
 number field.  The Legacy DICOM Gateway (LDGW) did this by creating a 
 custom configuration to prepend the Study Date to the Case number.  This 
 ability does not exist in the HDIG.  Images received under this condition 
 end up in the Importer DICOM Corret for later reconciliation.  
 This is causing a significant problem when using the Importer and having 
 the images available promptly.
                            
 Resolution 7:
 ============
 A DCF toolkit custom filter was added.  The class is VACustomFilter.  It 
 will use configuration information that is added to the DCF Listen file.  
 This only affects incoming images to the C-Store SCP on the HDIG.  The 
 configuration allows an override of the Accession#, Patient Name, and 
 Patient ID fields in the DICOM dataset.  Specifically, the Accession# can 
 be modified to match either of the two possible Accession# formats 
 (<date>-<case> or <site>-<date>-<case>).  The Patient Name can be 
 modified to replace Comma (",") delimiter with the proper DICOM Caret 
 ("^").  The Patient ID can be modified to either contain or remove dashes 
 ("-") between numbers.
  
 Problem 8:  Importer Inoperable When Extensive Number of Corrections 
 ====================================================================
 Needed
 ======
 Importer crashes (stops functioning) when there are over 15,000 entries 
 to be corrected.  This happens when there are too many records being 
 returned when the Importer makes an RPC Broker request.  
  
 Resolution 8:
 ============
 There is a MaximumNumberOfItemsToReturn parameter in the 
 ImagingShell.exe.config file that was not being used to manage the number 
 of entries returned.  Instructions were added to the Importer III User 
 Manual to set this configuration parameter, MaximumNumberOfItemsToReturn.
  
 Problem 9:  New Tomcat Service Parameters to Improve Performance
 ================================================================
 The mobile imaging application (Image Viewing Solution or IVS) team has 
 noticed some unusual network behavior when images are delivered from the 
 local VIX server to their application using the Patch 138 IMAGE 
 webservice.  Images are being delivered to their application in 9KB 
 bursts with delays between each packet, resulting in poor overall 
 performance when loading images from the VIX.  They have isolated this to 
 the VIX Apache Tomcat connector default setup.  In their test 
 environment, the IVS team modified the port 443 connector used by this 
 webservice in the hopes of optimizing Apache Tomcat to send large files.  
 Their initial results show a 4X improvement in image load times.
  
 Resolution 9:
 ============
 A section of the server.xml was modified for the VIX component.
  
 <Connector port="443" 
 protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol" 
 socket.rxBufSize="256000" socket.txBufSize="256000" 
 socket.directBuffer="true" connectionTimeout="20000" maxThreads="150" 
 clientAuth="false" enableLookups="true" disableUploadTimeout="true" 
 acceptCount="100" debug="11" secure="true" sslProtocol="TLS" 
 SSLEnabled="true" password/certificate_stuff_goes_here>
 .
 Problem 10:  VistA Imaging Saving Duplicate Images with Same Accession 
 ======================================================================
 Number
 ======
 A site is sending same study to multiple destinations (multiple HDIGs, 
 compass router) if the first send doesn't process in what the technician 
 deems a timely fashion.  Legacy listeners did not register this since 
 they only looked at the Instance UID (Unique Identifier) and would reject 
 the duplicates.  HDIGs had also been working fine for almost two years 
 with this worklflow (even though they look at 6 fields for 
 duplications).  The only thing that appears to have changed is that the 
 site went to site specific accession numbers (534-042015-1234) and HL7 
 2.4.  
  
 Resolution 10:
 =============
 Sites were sending duplicate studies.  Accession numbers were different, 
 but the studies and patients were the same.  The studies registered as a 
 duplicate instead of a resend when checking the legacy (2005) structure.  
 The MAGVGUID duplicate UID check was modified to mark these as resends 
 instead of duplicate UIDs.
  
 Problem 11:  Add Modified JCIFS.properties to Build Manifest
 ============================================================
 There is a modified version of JCIFS.properties (Java Common Internet 
 File System) available to the field.  It improves network 
 communications.  Clin 3 wants the modified version to replace the 
 original version in the build manifest.  
  
 Resolution 11:
 =============
 The new JCIFS.properties file from Clin 3 is included in the install.
  
 Problem 12:  Storing SOP Instance UID when SOP Class is Disabled
 ================================================================
 A site reported receiving multiple DICOM Storage SCP Processing error 
 messages on the HDIG:
 gov.va.med.imaging.core.interfaces.exceptions.MethodException: 
 gov.va.med.imaging.channels.CompositeIOException: 
 jcifs.smb.SmbException-The handle is invalid
 The 1.2.840.10008.5.1.4.1.1.77.1.5.4 (Ophthalmic Tomography Image 
 Storage) SOP Class was not initially enabled.  Images were sent and an 
 entry for the SOP Instance UID of the rejected image was created in 
 2005.64.
 The SOP Class was then enabled.  Images were resent and rejected because 
 the above entry already existed for the original SOP Instance UID in 
 2005.64.
 The UID Checker mechanism checked the Instance UID against ALL Instance 
 UIDs in the new data structure.  It even checked against those Instance 
 UIDs that were never stored, and that check is causing a problem.  It 
 should not be checking against those entries where "ARTIFACT ON FILE" is 
 NOT checked.
  
 Resolution 12:
 =============
 Artifact on File checking happens after other checks are performed.  
 These other checks may quit before the Artifact on File check is 
 performed.  A code change was made to move the Artifact on File check to 
 be performed earlier.
  
 Problem 13:  Site-specific Accession Number Issue in Query/Retrieve
 ===================================================================
 Query/Retrieve of a study by a site specific accession number (ex. 
 600-072015-389) via RPC "MAG CFIND QUERY" does not work properly due to a 
 failure to include the "ADC1" cross reference for lookups.  Cross 
 reference "ADC" in file #70 'RAD/NUC MED PATIENT' stores traditional 
 accession numbers, "ADC1" site specific accession numbers.
  
 Resolution 13:
 =============
 An additional code block was added to MAGDQR72 to perform lookups against 
 the ADC1 x-ref.
  
 Problem 14:  The Cache' Version 5.0/5.1 Checking Causes Problems on Post 
 ==========================================================================
 5.1 Versions Installs
 =====================
 While installing Cache' 2010.2 with Patch 138, several issues were found. 
 In MAGOSDIR, the DRIVES() function would not return the list of the drive 
 letters.  The DRIVE function that hardcodes Cache' 5.0 and 5.1 is only 
 used by the $$GETSHARE^MAGBRTA4 to select a share drive.  If the Cache' 
 version is neither 5.0 nor 5.1, the drive selection logic is ignored and 
 the "Q:" drive is always returned as the share drive.  There may be sites 
 in the field that are using a non-"Q:" share drive.
 The code to automatically close a "left over" open file would not work.  
 The code to automatically close a "left over" TCP connection also would 
 not work.
  
 Resolution 14:
 =============
 Version checking was removed from the DRIVE function.  The list of 
 returned drives is translated into upper case characters to ensure that 
 the function will work with the GETSHARE function in MAGBRTA4.
 The documented $ZU utility used in DEL^MAGOSDIR was replaced with a class 
 call.
  
 Upon testing, it was discovered that the $ZU utilities do work in Cache' 
 2010.2.  It was further determined that the $ZU utilities also work in 
 Cache' 2015.  The documentation for these functions has been deprecated, 
 but not the functions.
