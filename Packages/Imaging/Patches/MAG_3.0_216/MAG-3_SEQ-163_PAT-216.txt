 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1. Defect 750211 (Trouble Ticket INC0665500) FBCS Software Corruption
 Problem:  
 ========
 MAG*3.0*216 will resolve the Clinical Display Issue with Fee Basis Claims 
 System (FBCS). After MAG*3.0*191 was installed at the sites, users of the 
 FBCS software started reporting errors. The errors in FBCS state the 
 following:
 Error #339(Component 'tabctl32.ocx' or one of its dependencies not 
 correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid.)
 The C:\windows\Syswow64\tabctl32.ocx file that was deployed with the FBCS 
 application had to be re-registered. 
  
 Resolution: 
 ===========
 The installation of this patch will re-register the ocx file if needed. 
 When the Clinical Display installer runs, an internal flag will be set if 
 the C:\program files (x86)\vista\imaging\muse\tabctl32.ocx file exists 
 (i.e. there is a version of Clinical Display installed that includes the 
 C:\program files (x86)\vista\imaging\muse directory). Then after the 
 Clinical Display installer has finished, an automatic post install action 
 will re-register C:\windows\Syswow64\tabctl32.ocx if it exists and the 
 internal flag has been set. If the flag has not been set or 
 C:\windows\Syswow64\tabctl32.ocx does not exist then no attempt will be 
 made to re-register C:\windows\Syswow64\tabctl32.ocx.
  
 2. Defect 802092/815665 - Several of the help menu links are displaying an
 error when running on the Windows 10 operating system
  
 Problem:  
 ========
 When running Clinical Display on Windows 10 operating system, the 
 following help menu options are displaying the error when selected: Error 
 opening Help in Windows-based programs: "Feature not included" or "Help 
 not supported". 
 On the System Manager Help Menu
         System Manger Help
         Screen Settings
         Image Delete Help Screen
 On the Image Delete Window Help Menu
         Image Delete Window
  
 Resolution:  
 ===========
 The application has been fixed to provide an option to view the VistA 
 Imaging Display User Guide which has all the help information in it. The 
 menu items that were not working were removed.
