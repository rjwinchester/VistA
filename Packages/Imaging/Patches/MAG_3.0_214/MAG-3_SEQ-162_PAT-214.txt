 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview
 ===========================================
 1. Defect 740851 (Trouble Ticket # INC0300885)-Imaging Site Parameters
 screen, system displays an error message "Value is not initialized".
  
 Problem:  
 ========
 Issue 1:
 ======== 
 When user opens Background Processor - Imaging Site Parameters screen, 
 system displays an error message "Value is not initialized" and Background
 Processor freezes. The user cannot proceed forward. 
  
 Issue 2:
 ======== 
 Users are experiencing an issue where they cannot save the Default User 
 Preference when selecting a different name from was previous selected. 
  
 Resolution:
 ==========   
 A new Remote Procedure Call (RPC) "MAGQBP VAL" is called before the
 Imaging Site Parameters window is opened.  This new RPC will validate the 
 current values of the pointer fields:
 #100      DEFAULT USER PREFERENCE
 #.03      IMAGE NETWORK WRITE LOCATION
 #2.01     JUKEBOX WRITE LOCATION
 #1.02     PACS DIRECTORY
 #1.03     PACS IMAGE WRITE LOCATION 
  
 A message window will be displayed to the user if any of the current
 values are invalid.  If the current value of the Default User Preferences 
 field is invalid, it will be deleted from the IMAGING SITE PARAMETERS File
 (#2006.1).
  
 If invalid data is found, a confirmation message will be displayed to the 
 user.  Click OK and the Site Parameters window will open. 
  
 Note: If the Site Parameters window does not open, an authorized person 
       will need to correct the invalid pointer in VistA using Fileman 
       Enter/Edit.
  
 2. Defect 741310 (Trouble Tickets # INC0298707, INC0586047)-BP Queue
 processor is stopping with an error at some sites.
  
 Problem:  
 ========
 When running the Jukebox Queue and MAG*3.0*196 is running for a while, 
 unexpectedly the user will get stuck into an RPC Exception loop. The 
 users are prompted for access and verify code.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========   
 Occasionally, when an RPC Exception occurs, the connection to VistA is
 lost.  When the connection is lost, the BP will try to silently re-connect
 to VistA without user input.  In this issue, the user is prompted for
 their Access and Verify Codes because the user context has been cleared.
 The code has been modified to correctly use the last user context for the
 silent re-connect to VistA.
  
 3. Defect 741968 (Trouble Ticket # INC0383466)- 2-Factor Authentication
 prompt appearing for some users.
  
 Problem:  
 ========
 After installing the MAG*3.0*196, when launching the BP Queue Processor, 
 some sites are getting prompted for 2-factor authentication. The users 
 launch the BP Queue Processor then will receive the 2 - Factor
 Authentication message. If the user clicks cancel, the BP Queue Processor 
 will launch the window for access/verify code. The 2 - Factor 
 Authentication should not appear at all. Some users are using Dameware to 
 remote login to the server and login into the server using the
 administration password. 
  
 Resolution:   
 ===========
 MAG*3.0*196 and newer versions of the BP use the Broker Development Kit 
 (BDK) version 65 to connect to VistA.  BDK 65 incorporates 2FA 
 authentication to login to VistA. The BP code has been modified to use the
 login functionality from the last version of the BDK that did not 
 incorporate 2FA authentication.
  
 4. Defect 744739 (Ticket # R16489435FY17) - Network Password Update on 
 BGP causing issues.
  
 Problem:  
 ========
 When the user updates the Network Password in the Background Processor, 
 the system would randomly add an extra space to the end of the encrypted 
 password stored in VistA, which causes the user issues when trying to log 
 into other areas of VistA Imaging.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========   
 The BP uses Kernel functions to generate encrypted passwords. If spaces 
 exist in the encrypted password, the BP will continually re-encrypt the 
 password until no spaces exist. The user may see an information window 
 that says the password will be re-encrypted.  But there is no action 
 required on the user's part, except clicking 'OK'. 
  
  
 5. Defect 806306: BP Event Log Issue
  
 Problem:  
 ========
 In the Event Log, of the BP Main Window, the value for 'Vista Imaging
 Install' incorrectly displays 3.0p196.
  
 Resolution: 
 ===========
 The Event Log was fixed to correctly display the latest installed BP 
 Patch (MAG*3.0*214). 
  
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 The following sites are test sites for this patch:

    applications:
    MAG*3.0*214: VistA Imaging Background Processor 214       30.53.214.nn
  
 New Server Installation:
 ========================
 MAG*3.0*214 contains all the Background Processor and Background Processor
 utility applications.  It will install on a new server that hasn't had a
 previous BP installed. 
 Desktop shortcuts for the Purge, Verifier and Background Processor Queue 
 Processor are automatically created on the desktop. 
 If installing the BP Queue Processor, BP Verifier, and BP Purge on a
 64-bit operating system such as Windows 2012 Server, "Run as 
 administrator" must be manually set using the check box in the Advanced 
 Properties window on each of the desktop shortcuts and the menu options. 
 Do this for all three client applications.
 If the MAG*3.0*214 Background Processor client is installed before
 installing the MAG*3.0*214 KIDS, a message will display when the client 
 is run that says the versions of the Background Processor client and the 
 version of the VistA Imaging host system are not compatible.  The user 
 will be prompted to install compatible versions of the Background 
 Processor client and the VistA system host software.  If such a message 
 displays, complete the following steps: 
 1) Shut down the Background Processor client. 
 2) Install the MAG*3.0*214 KIDS. 
 3) Now run the MAG*3.0*214 Background Processor client.
