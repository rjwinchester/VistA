 VistA crashes when a "?" is entered at the Military Status query.
  
  
 Files & Fields Associated:
  
 File Name (Number)     Field Name (Number)      New/Modified/Deleted
 ------------------     -------------------      --------------------
 NURS STAFF (#210)      MILITARY STATUS (#.01)   Modified

 (Subfile #210.06)         
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC0672637 - Error on Military Status field.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In the Nursing package when editing a nursing staff record and typing a 
 question mark at the "MILITARY STATUS" prompt, the user gets a hard error:
 <UNDEFINED>10+8^DICQ1 *X.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Military Status field has screen code to transform the input to
 uppercase. This code was modified to check for a null input.
 The screen code was changed from:
         X:$D(^%ZOSF("UPPERCASE")) "N Y X ^%ZOSF(""UPPERCASE"") S X=Y Q"
 to:
         I $D(^%ZOSF("UPPERCASE")),$D(X) X "N Y X ^%ZOSF(""UPPERCASE"") S 
         X=Y Q"
 The data in the field is not affected by the DD and does not need to be 
 converted.
  
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch. Because this patch contains data 
 dictionary changes, back-out must be done with the participation of the
 sustainment team.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the MILITARY STATUS field's screen code 
 and can be provided upon request. Please call the national help desk or
 enter a help desk ticket, if required.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the MILITARY STATUS 
 field's screen code no longer matches the patch version.
