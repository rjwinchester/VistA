Subject: NURSING SERVICE POSITION; NURSING %ZIS CALL

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses two (2) issues:
  
 1.   When using the Service Position File, Edit option [NURAFL-SPO]
      in the Administrative Site File Functions option [NURSFL-MENU];
      the prompt for the Service Position abbreviation requires an
      entry of 10 characters or less.  When a new abbreviation is
      correctly entered, the application adds it as a new NURS SERVICE
      POSITION.  After entering the abbreviation, the application pops
      a ScreenMan Form that allows the abbreviation to be re-entered.
      If the abbreviation is re-entered with a value with a length
      greater than 10 characters, a program error occurs (UNDEFINED)
      and the typical user VistA session is terminated.
  
 2.   When a patient is admitted/transferred to a new ward and there
      is no corresponding entry in the NURS LOCATION file (#211.4),
      the user gets an erroneous message that Queueing is not allowed
      that is displayed after the "Patient Transferred" message.  This
      occurs because the program calls the DEVICE HANDLER (^%ZIS) with
      variable IOP set to the IEN (Internal Entry Number) of an entry
      in the DEVICE file (#3.5). When calling ^%ZIS in this manner,
      the value of IOP must have a grave character (`) as the first
      character to let ^%ZIS know that it is an IEN.

 1.      I15102538FY17 - Nursing Service Position
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the Service Position File, Edit option [NURAFL-SPO] in
 the Administrative Site File Functions option [NURSFL-MENU]; the 
 prompt for the Service Position abbreviation requires an entry of
 10 characters or less.  When a new abbreviation is correctly 
 entered, the application adds it as a new NURS SERVICE POSITION.
  
 After entering the abbreviation, the application pops a ScreenMan
 Form that allows the abbreviation to be re-entered.  If the 
 abbreviation is re-entered with a value with a length greater than
 10 characters, a program error occurs (UNDEFINED) and the typical 
 user VistA session is terminated.
  
 The ScreenMan Form "NURA-I-SERVICE" should not allow the re-entry 
 of the ABBREVIATION value which (by that time) has already been 
 added as a new NURS SERVICE POSITION.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The ScreenMan Form "NURA-I-SERVICE" is modified to disable editing
 of the ABBREVIATION entry.

 2.      R10297758FY16 - Nursing %ZIS Call
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a patient is admitted / transferred to a new ward and there 
 is no corresponding entry in the NURS LOCATION file (#211.4), the
 user gets an erroneous message that Queueing is not allowed 
 displayed after the "Patient Transferred" message.  This occurs 
 because the program calls the DEVICE HANDLER (^%ZIS) with variable
 IOP set to the IEN (Internal Entry Number) of an entry in the 
 DEVICE file (#3.5). When calling ^%ZIS in this manner, the value 
 of IOP must have a grave character (`) as the first character to 
 let ^%ZIS know that it is an IEN (Kernel 8.0 & Kernel Toolkit 7.3
 Developer's Guide, page 61). 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine ^NURSAMSG is modified to preface IOP with the grave 
 character (`).

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch 
    Can be installed when Nursing package users are on the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
          problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
       Following options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       To preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch prior
       to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' 
       option at this time. You may also compare the routines in your 
       production account to the routines in the patch by using the 
      'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' 
       Menu and select the package 'NUR*4.0*46'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       YES//, choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
       And Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Backout/Rollback Plan:
 ----------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch. It is imperative that you have performed a
 backup of the routine included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch description.
