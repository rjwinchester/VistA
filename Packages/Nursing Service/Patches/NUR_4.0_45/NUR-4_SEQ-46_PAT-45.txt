Subject: EPIP NUR REMEDIATION 2.0

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 NUR*4.0*45 provides the following enhancements to VistA:
  
 - Modifies the Nursing Patient Care Assignment Worksheet to display only 
 the last four digits of each patient's Social Security Number (SSN) and 
 to remove the admitting diagnosis from the worksheet and replace it with 
 the text "ON FILE." These changes protect confidential patient 
 information and help ensure privacy.
  
 - Enhances the Nursing End-of-Shift Report to facilitate communication 
 between staff when shifts change. This modification adds an additional 
 line of header information to the report to clarify the purpose of the 
 various report sections. The new header information includes Situation, 
 Background, Assessment, and Recommendation column headings. The report 
 additionally displays oxygen levels in the Assessment section where the 
 patient's vitals (Latest Vitals) are displayed.
  
 New categories (Assessment, Safety, and Special Needs) are added to the 
 Patient Problems section of the report to enable staff to document 
 additional information that is critical to patient care. The report is 
 further modified to display only the last four digits of the patient's 
 Social Security Number (SSN) to help ensure privacy.
  
 The Attending Physician's voice and digital pager numbers can be excluded 
 from the End-of-Shift Report. Excluding contact information for the 
 Attending Physician eliminates confusion for staff regarding who to 
 contact for patient care issues. This patch adds the PRINT ATT NUMS ON 
 EOS RPT field (#10.6) to the NURS PARAMETERS file (#213.9) to act as a 
 parameter that controls the display of the Attending Physician contact 
 numbers. Initially, the value is set to NO and Attending Physician 
 contact numbers are not displayed on the report. Users at each site can 
 display the Attending Physician contact numbers by setting the value to 
 YES using the Site Parameter File [NURSFL-SITE], which can be found using 
 the following pathway:
  
    Nursing System Manager's Menu [NURS-SYS-MGR]
      Nursing Features (all options) [NURS-ALL]
        Administrative Site File Functions [NURSFL-MENU]
          Site Parameter File [NURSFL-SITE]
  
 Your site might have modified the pathway, so check with your local IT 
 operations if you are having difficulty accessing the option.

 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option. The message containing the 
 backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at 
 the Message Action prompt. The PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE is 
 then used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA system.
  
 Note: If Data Dictionary changes are listed in the Files and Fields 
 Associated section of the patch description, then those changes will 
 remain in the Data Dictionary in the event that a restore is performed. 
 Updated files and fields must be manually removed from the Data 
 Dictionary by a programmer via FileMan.
