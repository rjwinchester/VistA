Associated patches: (v)NUR*4*22    <<= must be installed BEFORE `NUR*4*44'

Subject: EPIP NUR REMEDIATION 1.0

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 NUR*4.0*44 provides the following enhancements to VistA:
  
 - Enables the Ward staff to see which patients have opted out of the 
 facility directory when using the Ward Census, Print 
 (NURSPP-LOCWRD)option in VistA. This modification adds the indicator "!" 
 in front of a patient's name in the Patient Census report when that 
 patient has opted out of the facility directory.
  
 Currently, this indicator is displayed on the Inpatient Roster; however, 
 there is no indication on the Patient Census report that the patient has 
 opted out of the facility directory, which presents a patient privacy 
 issue.
  
 - Modifies the Ward Census, Print option in VistA to truncate a patient's 
 Social Security Number (SSN) to display only the last four digits on the 
 Patient Census  report. This modification also changes the column header 
 on the Patient Census report from "SSN" to "Last 4"to reflect the data 
 displayed in the column.
  
 Currently, the Patient Census report displays the patient's full SSN, 
 which presents a patient privacy issue.
