Subject: BED MANAGEMENT SOLUTION 1.6

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch announces the National Release of Bed Management Solutions 
 (BMS) version 1.6. No additional action is necessary for sites except to
 communicate the below modifications of BMS v1.6 to users.  This new BMS
 1.6 version addresses defects and there are no new enhancements.
  
 This build corrects four issues within the BMS application:
  
 1) Resolve defect on the National and VISN level Patient Pending Bed
    Placement List (PPBPL), where wait times are not calculating 
    correctly and remove time from the CH/CL Admission Date field.
  
 2) Resolve a defect on the VISN level PPBBL and associated reports, so
    it doesn't display patient full SSN.
  
 3) Make a minor fix to the login page, to simplify making  
    updates to the page before/during an outage.  
    
 4) Resolve a defect which removes all colors on the whiteboard when
    selecting to turn off the Blue/Pink option on the whiteboard.

 CA SERVICE DESK TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
  
 1) Incident # I6543658FY16:  Users report 2 issues with National 
    and VISN Level PPBPL: Inaccurate Wait Times and CH/CL Admission 
    show at midnight for every entry, which is not accurate. 
    
    Problem:
    ========
    Currently, wait times on the National Level PPBPL are showing 
    negative numbers when patients are dispositioned. If a patient 
    does not have a disposition date, the wait time calculation is 
    equal to the Current Date Time minus the Creation Date Time. If 
    the patient has a disposition date, the wait time calculation is 
    equal to the Disposition Date Time minus the Creation Date Time.
    Additionally, the CH/CL Admission Date field shows a time stamp. 
    This is a user entered field in which time is not being captured, 
    so the time always appears as midnight, which is not accurate.  
    
    Solution:
    =========
    This release will apply code fix to properly calculate Wait Time.
    In the new calculation, if a patient does not have a disposition 
    date, then the wait time will calculate as the Current Date minus 
    the Transfer Request Creation Date Time. If the patient does have 
    a disposition, then wait time will be calculated as Event Creation 
    Date Time minus Transfer Request Creation Date Time. Dispositioned 
    patients will show positive wait times instead of negative times.   
    Additionally, the date format for CH/CL Admission Date will be 
    Updated to remove reference to time.   
  
 2) Incident #I7122940FY16: Remove patient SSN from VISN level PPBPL 
    and VISN PPBPL reports 
  
    Problem:
    ========
    Privacy dictates the use of full SSN should be limited. 
    
    Solution:
    =========
    This release will implement a change to show only the last 4 
    digits of the patient's SSN on the display and reports. 
    Corresponding screen shot changes will be updated in the user
    guide.
  
 3) Incident # I7123200FY16:  Login page modifications to simplify 
    notifications when BMS is down for maintenance. 
  
    Problem:
    ========
    During BMS outages, it's currently time consuming and difficult to 
    update the maintenance page regarding the outage. This can delay the
    notification to users.
    
   
    Solution:
    =========
    This release implements an update to the maintenance page to quickly 
    and easily update the page when BMS is down or planned to be down. 
    When BMS is down, it does not allow the users to log in. Instead it 
    displays a message notifying users of the outage. Administrators
    control when the maintenance page is displayed.
    
  
  
 4) Incident # I7043794FY16: When turning off the Blue/Pink for gender 
    color. All of the colors disappear off the Ward Whiteboard, including green 
    for "Bed Available", red for "Bed out of Service" and Orange for 
    "Bed Assigned".
  
    Problem:
    ========
    Currently on the ward whiteboard page, when selecting the option
    "None" instead of "Blue/Pink" to identify male (blue) and female
    (pink) patients occupying beds on the whiteboard, other color bands 
    to identify bed availability, assignment, or beds out service are 
    also removed from the display.
    
   
    Solution:
    =========
    This release implements a change to show both male and female 
    patients occupying beds in a neutral color on the display, while not
    changing or clearing the color from available, assigned (reserved) or
    out of service beds.
