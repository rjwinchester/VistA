Subject: BED MANAGEMENT SOLUTION VERSION 1.4

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch announces the National Release of Bed Management Solutions 
 (BMS) version 1.4. No additional action is necessary for sites except to
 communicate the below modifications of BMS v1.4 to users.  This new BMS
 1.4 version addresses defects and there are no new enhancements.
  
 This build corrects four issues within the BMS application:
  
 1) Resolve a defect when a patient is removed from the Patient Pending Bed
    Placement (PPBP) list, the wait time continues to be calculated. 
  
 2) Resolve a defect to change the default end time for a facility diversion
    to "now" instead of the start time of the diversion.
  
 3) Resolve a defect where scheduled admissions are coming up with an assigned
    room date and time. 
 
 4) Fix to ADT processor to allow for tuning of the ADT processor via
    configuration change instead of having to change source code.
 
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKET(s):
  
 1) Remedy Incident # INC000001094698:  PPBPL wait times are not 
    accurate after a patient is admitted.  Wait times are also 
    showing negative numbers when patients are scheduled in the future.
 
 2) Remedy INC000001050969:  The default diversion end date and time 
    are currently set to be the same as the diversion start date and 
    time. The default time should be the current date and time instead.
  
 3) Remedy Incident #INC000001003458: Scheduled admissions are coming 
    up with an assigned to room date and time. These fields should be 
    empty by default.
 
 4) Remedy Incident #INC000001053407:  Fix to ADT processor to allow 
    for tuning of the ADT processor via configuration change instead 
    of having to change source code

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
  
 1) INC000001094698:  PPBPL wait times are not accurate after a patient is      
    admitted.  Wait times are also showing negative numbers when patients 
    are scheduled in the future.
  
    Problem:
    ========
    The Patient Pending Bed Placement List  (PPBPL) will not reflect 
    accurate Wait Time information for patients who have been admitted, 
    or those patients who have future appointments. When patients are 
    admitted, they are removed from the PPBPL in the standard view, but 
    when running a report to see Wait Times, BMS continues calculating 
    after the patient is admitted. In order to get accurate Wait Times, 
    the sites have to export the report and manually calculate. This 
    requires extra work to get accurate information. In the case of 
    future appointments, the negative Wait Times showing on the board 
    can cause confusion and make it difficult to evaluate the Wait Times.
    
    Solution:
    =========
    This release will apply code fix to properly calculate Wait Time.  
    Once a patient is admitted, the Wait Time stops calculating so that 
    reports show how much time they actually waited. Future appointments 
    show 0 wait time instead of negative times. 
  
 2) INC000001050969:  The default diversion end date and time are 
    currently set to be the same as the diversion start date and time. 
    The diversion end date and time should default to the current date
    and time.
  
    Problem:
    ========
    The default diversion end date and time are currently set to be 
    the same as the diversion start date and time, leading to problems 
    if users don't pay special attention to edit the end date and time
    when ending the diversion.  The diversion end date and time should
    default to the current date and time.
    
    
    Solution:
    =========
    This release will implement a code change to default the diversion 
    end date and time to the current date and time.  Users can still 
    manually change the diversion end time.
  
 3) Incident #INC000001003458: Scheduled admissions are coming up with 
    an assigned room time of 7 AM, both for current and past admissions.
    These fields should be empty by default.
  
  
    Problem:
    ========
    This defect is visible when users access the "Patient Flow" view 
    of the Patient Pending Bed Placement List (PPBPL) and can be edited 
    by selecting the "Edit" link for the patient and updating the 
    "Assignment Date Time" fields.  Users will need to continually 
    manually edit the "Assignment Date Time" fields to either remove 
    the entries or enter the correct entries.  If not corrected, the 
    Patient Flow View shows incorrect and confusing information displayed
    in the "Assigned to Room Date Time" column.  Incorrect "Assignment
    Time" on the Patient Flow View could result in delays in room
    assignment.
    
    Solution:
    =========
    This release changes the default "Assignment Date and Time" to null.
  
 4) INC000001053407: Fix to ADT processor to allow for tuning of the ADT
    processor via configuration change instead of having to change source 
    code.
  
    Problem:
    ========
    If changes to the ADT processor are needed to ensure movements
    entered in VistA are recorded in BMS, a new release is needed
    to implement the changes.
    
    Solution:
    =========
    This release allows for tuning of the ADT processor without the 
    need to edit source code.  This code will allow us to optimize  
    how far back into the Movement file the delta processor should go. 
    This will allow us to work on optimization of the Movement record 
    process by only requiring a restart of the BMS service rather than 
    releasing a new version.
