 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
  INC000000934581 -POC states there is a wait time of 719 hours,6 minutes.
  POC further states there seems to be an error in the script.
  
    Problem:
    ========
    The "wait-time" field on the PPBP list continues to calculate after the
    patient has been removed from the list.  When viewing past entries the 
    "wait-time" displays the number of hours since the patient was entered.
    The "wait-time" should display the number of hours from the time the  
    patient was entered to the time the patient was removed.
    
    Solution:
    =========
   Update BMS code so that the "wait-time" on the PPBP list shows the
   number of hours from the time the patient was entered to the time the
   patient was removed.
  
 OTHER ISSUES OVERVIEW:
 ======================
     
   Problem:
   ========

   Solution:
   =========
   Removed tracers from log file used for troubleshooting.   
   
   Problem:
   ========

   Solution:
   ========
   Analysis was performed on BMS v1.1. BMS team implemented recommended 
   updates received from analysis performed by Microsoft.  
   Updates addressed the way multiple processes are managed through 
   threading modules. Problems with threading can greatly affect the 
   resources used by the application. The update includes the use of a new 
   threading method that handles how the multiple threads are accessed 
   by the VI Service.
