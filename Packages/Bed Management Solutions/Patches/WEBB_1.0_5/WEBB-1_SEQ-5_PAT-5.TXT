 Description:
 ===========
  
 This patch announces the National Release of Bed Management Solutions 
 (BMS) version 1.5. No additional action is necessary for sites except to
 communicate the below modifications of BMS v1.5 to users.  This new BMS
 1.5 version addresses defects and there are no new enhancements.
  
 This build corrects seven issues within the BMS application:
  
 1) Resolve defect on the Patient Movement Report by Date where it doesn't
    contain all of the correct movements.
 
 2) Resolve a defect on the National level Icon Report, so it doesn't
    run by default for all of the sites.
  
 3) Resolve a defect on the Scheduled Admission by Date report, which 
    currently displays the patient's full SSN under the Patient Name
    column.  
    
 4) Resolve a defect on the Scheduled Admissions (next 7 days) report, 
    which currently displays the patient's full SSN under the Patient 
    Name column.  
 
 5) Resolve a defect where the ampersand "&" symbol causes an unhandled
    Exception error in BMS.
 
 6) Resolve a defect where BMS contingency reports won't be saved to the
    Contingency folder when the BMS Ward name includes one of the 
    following special characters: (/\:*?"<>|)
 
 7) Resolve issues associated with user login by providing a link to the
    BMS Point of Contact (POC) list for first line assistance and 
    verification of access. 
 
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKET(s):
  
 1) Remedy Incident # INC000001084183:  When running the Patient Movement 
    by Date Report and selecting a date range, movements updated in VistA 
    outside of  the date range do not appear in the report. When running 
    reports for a specified timeframe, movements edited later (represented 
    by the "Entered D/T" column in BMS) do not show up, unless the date 
    of the movement report is extended to include the date the movement 
    was modified. Also, Specialty Transfers are not properly filtered.
  
 2) Remedy Incident #INC000001256965:  Fix parameters for the Icon 
    Report so it doesn't run by default for all of the sites.  
 
 3) Remedy Incident # INC000001233670:  The "scheduled admissions by 
    date" report displays the patient's FULL SSN under the "Patient Name"

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
  
 1) Incident # INC000001084183:  When running the Patient Movement by
    Date Report and selecting a date range, movements updated in VistA 
    outside of  the date range do not appear in the report.  
    
    Problem:
    ========
    The Patient Movement by Date report is using the "entered date and
    time" field to determine the Admissions, Discharges and Transfers 
    to display in the report, instead of the "movement date and time". 
    This causes movements entered outside the timeframe selected not 
    To show up in the report, even if the movements are inside the 
    Selected timeframe.  Also the Specialty transfers are not currently
    being filtered for the end date, so the end date for Specialty
    Transfers is always the current date/time. 
    
    Solution:
    =========
    This release will apply fixes to the report parameters to use the
    "movement date and time" instead of "entered date and time" for
    filtering Admissions, Discharges and Transfers. The Specialty 
    Transfers will be filtered the same. 
  
 2) Incident #INC000001256965:  Fix parameters for the Icon Report
    so it doesn't run by default for all of the sites. 
 
    Problem:
    ========
    Currently, when users with BMS National privileges select the 
    "Report" button from the Administration page / Add/Edit Icon page 
    in BMS, the Icon report runs by default for all of the facilities;  
    therefore, it is possible for a Nationa user to inadvertently run 
    an Icon Report for all of the facilities. Running this large report 
    during peak hours could cause an impact BMS system performance, or 
    even potentially cause the server to go down.  
    
    Solution:
    =========
    Default the Facility to be blank (no facilities selected), so 
    the National user has to manually select the facilities. When the
    "Report" button from the Administration page / Add/Edit Icon page is   
    selected, the report parameters are displayed and the user must select 
    the facilities for which they want to run the report, or select the
    "(select all)" checkbox to run the report.
 
 3) Incident # INC000001233670:  The "scheduled admissions by date
    report displays the patient's FULL SSN under the "Patient Name" 
    column, not the patient's name. 
  
    Problem:
    ========
    The BMS user manual and the report itself says the patient's name 
    should be displayed, but the full SSN is displayed instead.
    Privacy also dictates the use of full SSN should be limited. 
   
    Solution:
    =========
    This release will implement a change in the report parameters to
    display the patient's name in the following format: 
    LastName (L1234). Corresponding changes to the user guide will 
    be made.
 
  
 4) Incident #INC000001233683: The scheduled admissions (next 7 days)
    report displays the patient's FULL SSN under the "Patient Name" 
    column.  
  
    Problem:
    ========
    The BMS user manual and the report itself says the patient's name 
    should be displayed, but the full SSN is displayed instead.
    Privacy also dictates the use of full SSN should be limited. 
   
    Solution:
    =========
    This release will implement a change in the report parameters to
    display the patient's name in the following format: 
    LastName (L1234). Corresponding changes to the user guide will 
    be made.
  
 5) Incident #INC000001259968: Fix ampersand "&" issue which 
    causes unhandled exception error in 2 areas of BMS.
  
    Problem:
    ========
    Currently, when an ampersand "&" is  used in a Facility Name 
    or in a VistA Ward Name, BMS may display an unhandled exception 
    error for certain transactions.  
       - When "&" is used in the Facility Name and a Bed Summary Report 
         is run from the VISN page, an unhandled exception error occurs. 
       - when trying to delete a BMS ward where there is an association 
         to a VistA Ward with an "&" in the name, an unhandled exception 
         error occurs.   
    
    Solution:
    =========
    Implement a code fix to handle the ampersand "&" correctly without 
    causing an unhandled exception error. 
 
 6) Incident #INC000001259975: Fix Contingency Report issue: 
    When a BMS Ward Name contains the following special characters 
    (/\:*?"<>|), the contingency report for that ward doesn't get 
    created.  
 
    Problem:
    ========
    The BMS Contingency Settings page allows the user to set up network
    storage area to backup an image of the current Ward Whiteboard for 
    BMS contingency planning. When performing this action, a list of 
    wards defined for the current facility is displayed and the user 
    enters a valid network share path for the Whiteboard Report to be 
    saved. Currently, if the BMS Ward contains any of the following 
    special characters: (/\:*?"<>|) the report is not saved, because 
    windows doesn't recognize the special characters, so doesn't save 
    the report.   
    
    Solution:
    =========
    Special characters will be replaced with an "_" for contingency 
    reporting purposes, so the reports are saved. Modifications to 
    the user guide will indicate this change.
 
 7) Incident #INC000001288554: Need link below on sign in page, 
    with text If you are having issues logging into the BMS application 
    please click link and find your POC at your site. Contact them for
    assistance. 
 
    Problem:
    ========
    Currently, when hospital staff try to log into BMS and receive an 
    error, they contact the National Service Desk (NSD) for assistance. 
    This may not be necessary in cases where they have not been provided 
    with access to BMS. In many cases it's best to start dialog with their 
    supervisor or BMS site coordinator to request or verify their access
    before contacting NSD.   
    
    Solution:
    =========
    Add a link on the login page to the BMS Points of Contact (POCs) 
    advising users to contact their site POC if they are having issues
    accessing BMS.  The BMS POCs will verify their access and ensure users 
    have the proper privileges before routing to NSD.
