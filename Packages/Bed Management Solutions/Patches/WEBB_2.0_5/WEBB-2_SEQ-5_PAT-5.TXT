Subject: BMS Version 2.2

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Bed Management Solution (BMS) v2 software enhancement
 project is to improve usability of the BMS v2 system, which improves
 the data accessibility and usability for BMS v2 users, and
 increase the integration of BMS v2 and VA systems.
  
 The following enhancements are included in this release:
  
 1. BMS PIV/Single Sign On (SSO) Capability:
         The IAM Team is issuing a Patch on 2/18/2017 to modify the
         acceptable Header format for authentication. BMS has made the
         appropriate change to the SSO Header to coincide with the new
         IAM Patch.
 2. 508 Compliancy:
         The latest 508 scan revealed 2 issues which have been remediated
         with this release.
         a) In the HTML, there was a white letter "t" in one of the pages
         against a white background. This rendered it invisible on the
         page. It was removed.
         b) Ten HTML fields (rarely-used evacuation values) on the
         patient admission page did not have a lable. HTML meta-data
         was added so that the screen reader could refer to those
         fields and associated values.
