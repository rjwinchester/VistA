 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 -----------------------------
 PSI# 2640
 Problem: The user's column sort is not retained due to a screen refresh
 every 90 seconds, making it more challenging for the BMS user to 
 efficiently identify and take action on those patients needing admission
 or a transfer due to change in level of care.
  
 Resolution: BMS Version 2 Patch US031.05 modifies the BMS software PPBP 
 view so that it still refreshes (updating the contents of the list if
 there are changes during the user's open session), but does not override
 the user's selection for how the list should be ordered.

 Dallas, TX
