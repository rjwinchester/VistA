Subject: BED MANAGEMENT SOLUTION VERSION 1.3.1

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch announces the National Release of Bed Management Solutions 
 (BMS) version 1.3.1. No additional action is necessary for sites except to
 communicate the below modifications of BMS v1.3.1 to users.  This new BMS
 1.3.1 version addresses defects and there are no new enhancements.
  
 This build corrects three issues within the BMS application and replaces 
 Bed Management Solution (BMS) Version 1.3 patch entered in error.
 One defect fix to implement a thread safe data type, ConcurrentDictionary,
 was removed from the patch due to issues it introduced when installed.
 The three issues corrected by this build, BMS v1.3.1 are:
 
 1) Resolution of a time zone issue - the system currently does not work 
    properly during the time change to Daylight Savings Time. When patient 
    movements are entered during the hour of the time change, background 
    processes fail, causing issues with migrating VistA data into the BMS 
    database. When this happens BMS goes down until the records are 
    adjusted.
 
 
 2) Implementation of code that handles a user's Active Directory (AD) name 
    change, so they can continue to use the system when their AD name changes.
 
 2) Implementation of a maintenance page, so users cannot login during 
    system maintenance.
 
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKET(s):
 
 1) INC000000982332 - Bed Management Solutions - Background Process Issue - 
    BMS's background processor has failed and has been down since 03/09/14.
 
 2) INC000001022625 - Bed Management Solutions - Other - Application 
    doesn't drop the old name of a user.  After a name change or domain 
    change, users cannot access BMS without manual intervention by DBA to 
    update the database by dropping the old name and the permissions.
 
 3) INC000001031512 - Bed Management Solutions - Login - When BMS is down
    for maintenance, users are not notified of an outage on the BMS login page.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 
 1) INC000000982332 - Bed Management Solutions - Background Process Issue
    - BMS's background processor has failed and has been down since 03/09/14.
 
    Problem:
    ========
    The system currently does not work properly when the time change to 
    Daylight Savings Time occurs. When patient movements are entered during 
    the hour of the time change, background processes fail, causing issues 
    with migrating VistA data into the BMS database. When this happens BMS 
    goes down until the records are adjusted
    
    Solution:
    =========
    Apply code fix to allow the system to continue working following the 
    change to Daylight Savings Time.
 
 
 2) INC000001022625 - Bed Management Solutions - Other - Application 
    doesn't drop the old name of a user.  After a name change or domain 
    change, users cannot access BMS without manual intervention by DBA to 
    update the database by dropping the old name and the permissions.
  
    Problem:
    ========
    When a user's Active Directory (AD) name changes, they cannot log into BMS 
    until their old name is removed from the BMS database.
    
    Solution:
    =========
    Implement a code change that allows the user to continue to use BMS 
    after an AD name change.
 
 3) INC000001031512 - Bed Management Solutions - Login - When BMS is down
    for maintenance, users are not notified of an outage on the BMS login 
    page.
 
  
    Problem:
    ========
    When the BMS system is taken down for maintenance, users still see 
    the login screen, which makes it seem like they should be able to 
    access and use BMS.
    
    Solution:
    =========
    Implement a maintenance page that informs users that BMS is down and 
    doesn't provide the option to log in during planned maintenance. 
    Administrators control when the maintenance page is displayed and 
    the Business Team provides input for the message to users during 
    maintenance. While this change is self-explanatory, it will require 
    changes to the user guide.
