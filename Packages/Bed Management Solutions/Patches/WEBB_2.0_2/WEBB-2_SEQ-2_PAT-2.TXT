Subject: BMS Version 2.0.1.1

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Bed Management Solution (BMS) v2 software enhancement
 project is to improve usability of the BMS v2 system, which improves
 the data accessibility and usability for BMS v2 users, and
 increase the integration of BMS v2 and VA systems.
  
 The following enhancements are included in this release:
  
 1. Reduce Number of calls and threads used in common functions:
         Removed locking from caches where concurrent dictionaries
         are in use.
 2. Single Sign-On (SSO) PIV Integration:
         Final tweaks to remove logging and move mock headers for
         full PIV Integration. For SSO to be turned on, it will
         require a final configuration update in a future release.
         These changes do not enable PIV authentication.
 3. Ward Whiteboard Sorting Patch:
         Restored the original sort method from tablesorter 2.0.3
         for specific bed column. This prevents ward names like
         "3E-123" from being evaluated as an exponential expression.
 4. Orderable Item Deletion Failures:
         Removed a Fortify fix from Increment 1 (later identified as
         a false positive) that was causing Orderable Item
         deletion to fail.
 5. VISN Waiting List switches to users VISN when customized:
         When navigating to a VISN that is not the user's default,
         the app initially shows the correct data.  If the grid is
         customized, it refreshes and shows the user's default VISN data
         instead of the current VISN's data. The fix will cause the
         selected VISN data to be displayed after customizing the grid.
 6. EMS Batch Assignment:
         "Select All" was broken due to a TRM mandated jQuery library
         update. The JavaScript in question was located where it should
         not have been. The previous jQuery library did not enforce a
         location rule while the new jQuery library does. The fix was
         to move the JavaScript to the correct location to be
         loaded/executed.
 7. Waiting List - Edit Patient missing comment box:
         The new comment text box was missing from the "Waiting List -
         Add Patient" page. Comment box is now visible.
 8. Patient Flow View Issue:
         The Patient Flow view of the facility waiting list isn't saving
         between user sessions.
