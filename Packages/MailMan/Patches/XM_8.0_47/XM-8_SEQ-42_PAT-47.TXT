Subject: XM API FIXES,BULLETIN FILE UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch XM*8.0*47 addresses five issues:
  
 1. When using the Mailman extrinsic function $$MG^XMBGRP to create a new 
 mail group, if the organizer's DUZ is only 4 digits, and those 4 digits 
 match with the last 4 of the SSN of any person in the New Person(#200) 
 file, the call will fail and the mail group will not be created.
  
 2. When using the Mailman API SENDMSG^XMXAPI, if the subject line is 
 under 3 characters or over 65 characters the API will fail and the 
 message will not be sent. When using the Mailman application to send a 
 message, subject lines are automatically truncated. The code changes will 
 duplicate this functionality.
  
 3. An entry in the BULLETIN(3.6) file named XM DOMAIN ADDED makes several 
 references to the NOIS system which is no longer used. In an effort to 
 correct this issue and avoid future issues, the name NOIS will be 
 replaced with the more generic term "trouble ticket."
  
 4. Two Mailman API's have been confirmed to be functioning incorrectly. 
 The COPYAMT^XMXSEC1 API does not properly count the number of lines in a 
 mail message. The OPTEDIT^XMXSEC2 API does not properly check if a 
 message text or message subject line can be edited.
  
 5. Mailman API QX^XMXUTIL3 is not properly displaying a list of users 
 that are either current or not current in reading a message.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1)  INC00000385178 - Mailman - Report Issue:
                                                
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the Mailman extrinsic function $$MG^XMBGRP to create a new mail
 group, if the organizer's DUZ is only 4 digits, and those 4 digits match
 with the last 4 of the SSN of any person in the New Person(#200) file, the
 call will fail and the mail group will not be created.
      
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The CREATE tag line of XMBGRP contains a FILE^DICN call. The DIC("DR") array
 will be modified to use a four slash stuff for the ORGANIZER(#5) field data 
 to bypass the input transform which prevents four digit DUZ'S from being 
 rejected. This allows the function to successfully create a new mail group.
  
 2)  INC000000760688 - ANC-KPratt API SENDMSG^XMXAPI and XMSUB over 65
 characters 
   
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the Mailman API SENDMSG^XMXAPI, if the subject line is under 3
 characters or over 65 characters the API will fail and the message will not
 be sent. When using the Mailman application, subject lines are automatically
 truncated. The code changes here will duplicate this functionality.
  
       
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The XMXAPI routine will be modified to truncate message subjects, which
 prevent the API from failing.
  
 3)  INC000000849623 - Remove reference to old ticketing system
                                                
 Problem:
 --------
 An entry in the BULLETIN(3.6) file named XM DOMAIN ADDED makes several
 references to the NOIS system which is no longer used. In an effort to 
 correct this issue and avoid future issues, the name NOIS will be replaced
 with the more generic term "trouble ticket."
      
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Created a post-install routine (XM47PT) to update the BULLETIN(3.6) file
 entry for XM DOMAIN ADDED, removing all references to NOIS.
  
 4)  INC000000968732 - Two Mailman API errors need repair
   
 Problem:
 --------
 Two Mailman API's have been confirmed to be functioning incorrectly.
 COPYAMT^XMXSEC1 is an API that counts message lines, response lines, and the
 number of responses in a message. This is used to determine if a message can
 be copied based on site parameters. This API does not properly count lines.
 OPTEDIT^XMXSEC2 is an API that returns information on a specific mail
 message. The API does not properly check if a message text or message line
 can be edited.
  
       
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified COPYAMT^XMXSEC1 to work when variable XMWHICH contains a comma.
 Modified OPTEDIT^ XMXSEC2 routine to determine if a message or subject line
 can be edited.
  
 5)  INC000000969711 - MailMan - Other: API Problems
                                                
 Problem:
 --------
 Mailman API QX^XMXUTIL3 is not properly displaying a list of users that are
 either current or not current in reading a message.
      
 Resolution:
 -----------
 By correcting a flaw in the code logic on routine XMXUTIL3, the call will
 return the information it is supposed to.
