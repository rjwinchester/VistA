 1. INC0223620 - Bug in a VistA Mailman routine, XMAPHOST. 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the P-MESSAGE device, an escape variable is set and
    never removed when the user presses enter at the, 'And Send to' prompt.
    This may lead to unexpected results in subsequent functions that check 
    the value of the escape variable. This also can result in an undesired
    exit from the report transmission during normal operations or other
    errors due to faulty MailMan code.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The tag TOWHOM in routine XMJMT has been altered to NEW the DIRUT, 
    DUOUT and DTOUT variables. In addition, the tags QQ and S were also
    altered this way to accommodate entry of "??" with the "S" option to
    prevent these tags from creating the same issue.
