 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1. INC000000997119 - PRESCRIPTION TRANSACTION
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In the unlikely case where outpatient prescription transactions are
    created at the same exact date/time for the same pharmacy location 
    the option Rx (Prescription) Outpatient Dispensing Report [PSD RX
    DISPENSING REPORT] only displays one and not both or all of them.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified code in routine PSDOPTS to allow for multiple RX with
    the same pharmacy location and date and time of creation to be shown.
  
  
 2. INC000001234782 - "ORDERED BY" FIELD NOT UPDATING
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The CS WORKSHEET (#58.85) file ORDERED BY (#12) field is not being
    updated correctly when someone edits a controlled substance order for
    an NAOU using the CS Order Entry for Ward [PSD ORDER ENTRY] option.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routine PSDORP1 to use the correct data for the CS WORKSHEET
    (#58.85) file ORDERED BY (#12) field.
