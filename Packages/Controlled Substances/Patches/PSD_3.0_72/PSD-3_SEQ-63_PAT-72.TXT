Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following 2 problems:

    balance adjustments when a dose is signed out for a patient using the
    Sign Out Dose for Patient [PSD NURSE DISPENSING] option.
  
 2. When there are multiple transactions for the same date/time but with
    different pharmacy locations, not all of the transactions show up on

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC000000438928 - Balance Adjustment Problem w/Activity Report
  
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Activity Report [PSD NURSE DISP REPORT] does not take into account
    balance adjustments when a dose is signed out for a patient using the
    Sign Out Dose for Patient [PSD NURSE DISPENSING] option.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The Activity Report [PSD NURSE DISP REPORT] will be modified to account
    for the balance adjustment when a dose is signed out for the patient
    using the Sign Out Dose for Patient [PSD NURSE DISPENSING] option.
  
    Technical:
    ----------
    ^PSDPAT1 and ^PSDPAT2 will be modified to account for Sign Out Dose for
    Patient and balance adjustment within the same transaction.
  
  
 2. INC000000457994 - RX not showing on report
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When there are multiple transactions for the same date/time and
    different pharmacy locations, not all of the transactions show up on
    the RX (Prescription) Outpatient Dispensing Report [PSD RX DISPENSING
    REPORT].
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The RX (Prescription) Outpatient Dispensing Report [PSD RX DISPENSING
    REPORT] will be modified to include all transactions for a single
    date/time entry and multiple pharmacy locations.
  
    Technical:
    ----------
    Modify ^PSDOPTI routine to use $D(^PSD(58.81,"ACT",PSDT,PSDLOC))
    when looping through the ^PSD(58.81,"ACT" index instead of
    $O(^PSD(58.81,"ACT",PSDT,PSDLOC))=PSDLOC.
