Subject: RX OUTPATIENT DISPENSING REPORT MISSING ENTRIES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue:
  
 1. R19391179FY18  - Rx not showing on Rx Disp Report
   
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. R19391179FY18  - Rx not showing on Rx Disp Report
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 Togus VA noticed a problem with a controlled substance prescription (Rx) that
 was filled locally and released, but was not showing up on the Rx Outpatient
 Dispensing Report [PSD RX DISPENSING REPORT] option. It was determined that
 if a prescription had at least one fill that was transmitted to CMOP (not yet
 released) it would prevent all the prescription fills from being listed on
 this report. The report should list locally dispensed controlled substance
 prescription fills that have not posted on the CS Vault inventory.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The report was fixed to only screen out the specific CMOP fill(s) from being
 listed on the report and it will now print all the fills that were dispensed
 locally if they match the report search criteria.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modified routine PSDOPTN at START+11 to verify the actual fill # before
 marking it as a CMOP fill.
   
   
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Oklahoma City VAMC
 Maine VA HCS
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 The Rx (Prescription) Outpatient Dispensing Report [PSD RX DISPENSING
 REPORT] should not be executed while the patch is being installed. It should
 take less than 2 minutes to install this patch.
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
    2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  From this menu, you may select to use the
       following options: 
       when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the patch # PSD*3.0*85:
  
         a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed. It compares all components of this patch 
            routines, DDs, templates, etc.
  
         c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
  
    4. From the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
       choose the patch to install.
  
    5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//'
       respond NO.
  
    6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//' respond NO.
  
    7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation
 of the development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision
 between the development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should
 have saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the
 Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at
 time of install). The message containing the backed up routines can
 be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action
 prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used
 to install the backed up routines onto the VistA System. 
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
