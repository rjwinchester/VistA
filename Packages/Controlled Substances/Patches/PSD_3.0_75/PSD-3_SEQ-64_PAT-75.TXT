 OVERVIEW:
 =========
 1. INC000000602941 - A portion of this report is not working correctly Rx
                      (Prescription) Outpatient Dispensing Report  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Rx (Prescription) Outpatient Dispensing Report [PSD RX DISPENSING
 REPORT] should only show the local prescriptions and the CMOP prescriptions
 should be screened out.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine for the Rx (Prescription) Outpatient Dispensing Report [PSD
 RX DISPENSING REPORT] will be modified to screen out CMOP prescriptions.
  
 Technical:
 ----------
 The ^PSDOPTN routine will be modified to screen out prescriptions
 that have been sent to CMOP.
  
 2. INC000000788871 - Destruction holding numbers do not appear on the 
                      Destroyed Drugs Report after being destroyed.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Destroyed Drugs Report [PSD DEST DRUGS REPORT] does not report on
 destruction holding transactions for drugs destroyed when the user does not
 select ^ALL for the vaults.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine for the Destroyed Drugs Report [PSD DEST DRUGS REPORT] will
 be modified to allow users to select a single or multiple vaults.
  
 Technical:
 ----------
 The ^PSDESTP routine will be modified to initialize the pharmacy location
 variable before starting the for loop to step through the data.
  
 3. INC000000819482 - Printing Issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When printing the NAOU Usage Report [PSD NAOU USAGE] for a NAOU which
 has no activity in that time frame, the NAOU selected does not print in the
 header of the report. Inspectors would like the NAOU chosen to print on
 the report whether there is usage or no usage during the time frame
 chosen. Currently it is impossible to tell which NAOU's were selected to
 be included on the report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The NAOU Usage Report [PSD NAOU USAGE] will be modified to include the NOAUs
 that have not had any usage for the requested reporting time period.
  
 Technical:
 ----------
 The ^PDNU2 and ^PSDNU3 routines will be modified to print the NAOU header
 and the message "*****  NO DATA AVAILABLE FOR THIS REPORT  *****" if there
 has been no activity during the reporting period.
