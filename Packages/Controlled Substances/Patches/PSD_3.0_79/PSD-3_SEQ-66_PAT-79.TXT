 CA SDM OVERVIEW: 
 ================
 1. I10091822FY16 - Return to Stock Issue 
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 A Controlled Substance (CS) Refill is returned to stock through Outpatient
 Pharmacy (OP) package. When prompted, the user selects NO to add the stock to
 the balance in the Narcotic vault because the medication was going to be
 destroyed if it is left in the pharmacy. (They cannot add it back to stock in
 this case.)  The refill was marked as Returned to Stock in the OP package. 
 When the user re-submitted the refill, they tried to post it in the CS
 package. The system allows the user to release the refill in the OP
 package, but since the refill had not been added back to inventory, the CS
 package did not recognize that the refill had been filled again, and did
 not allow them to post the refill.
   
 Resolution: 
 -----------
 The routine PSDOPT0 that is called from the Outpatient Pharmacy system that
 performs the Return To Stock for Controlled Substances will be modified to 
 account for a Controlled Substance drug that is being returned with the intent
 to destroy.  
   
 Technical: 
 ----------
 Routine PSDOPT0 will be modified to set the return to stock quantity to zero
 if the user answers NO to the Do you want ## added to balance in the Narcotic
 vault? Yes// prompt. (## is the quantity that that was dispensed) 
  
 2. I10140662FY16 - Return to stock entry not always accepted 
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When a pharmacist is entering return to stock in the Controlled substance 
 package, it is not being accepted if the user does not select a Controlled
 Substance vault to return it to.  
   
 Resolution: 
 -----------
 The routine PSDOPT0 that performs the 'Return to Stock' for Controlled
 Substances was fixed to force a user to select a Vault and not enter
 past. The "Prescription Not Returned to Stock" message will also be displayed.  
  
 Technical: 
 ----------
 Routine PSDOPT0 will be modified to exit properly without making any updates
 if the user does not select a Controlled Substance vault to return the 
 drug to.  
  
 3. I10152355FY16 - SITE Reporting Problems with Controlled Substance 
                    Green Sheets 
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 The Green Sheet Ready for Pickup Log [PSD PRINT GS PICKUP] option does not
 show all of the Green Sheets Ready for Pickup. This is caused when 2 users
 order the same drug from the same Narcotics Area Of Use (NAOU) at the same
 time. This results in multiple orders being assigned to the same request
 number for a drug in the DRUG ACCOUNTABILTY STATS file (#58.8).
  
 Resolution: 
 -----------
 The routines that create the entries in the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY STATS file
 (#58.8) will be modified to lock drug at the pharmacy location prior to
 acquiring and setting request number in the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY STATS file
 (#58.8) during ordering.  
  
 A post-install cleanup routine (PSD79P) will search any transactions that
 have different pharmacy dispensing numbers and the same DRUG
 ACCOUNTABILITY STATS file (#58.8) request number. Once these transactions
 have been identified, a new request number will be assigned and saved.
  
 An informational report will be sent in MailMan to all the users that hold the
 PSDMGR security key.

 4. R11999082FY17 - Inventory Sheet inaccurate for Biloxi inpatient Vault 
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When the user up-carets (^) out at the prompt, "REASON EDITED" during 
 Edit/Cancel Verified Orders [PSD EDIT/CANC VER ORD] option with the intent of
 cancelling the request, it displays "** No action taken. **", indicating the
 transaction was aborted. When you look at the master vault inventory, it has
 been updated, however, the Controlled Substance order for the NAOU and the
 green sheet are not updated, creating a discrepancy.  
  
 Resolution: 
 -----------
 The routine (PSDEV01) that performs the transaction updates has been
 modified to perform all updates after all the user prompts. If the user
 up-carets (^) out then the changes are aborted.
  
 Technical: 
 ----------
 Routine PSDEVO1 has been modified to update the master vault inventory, NAOU
 Controlled Substance order and the green sheet only after the user completes
 all the prompts.
  
 5 & 6.  R14730330FY17 - Reporting event of errors that occurred during
         VISTA operations
      
         I14905678FY17 - Similar issue as in R14730330FY17, but in the 
         DRUG ITEM field (#13) (free text)
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When using the options, Non-VA Drug Placed on Hold for Destruction [PSD 
 DEST TEXT DRUG] option and the Destroy a Controlled Substances Drug [PSD
 DESTROY DRUGS] option, entering a ";" in a free text field such as 
 the DRUG ITEM field (#13) or the comment field causes a hard error.
  
  
 Resolution: 
 -----------
 To prevent the hard error, the drug item and the comment field will be
 validated to not allow entry of a ";".
  
 Technical: 
 ----------
 Routine PSDEST and PSDESTF will be modified to check for ";" in the 
 comment field and to display a message, "A semicolon is not allowed in the
 COMMENTS field. Please edit your entry."
  
 Routine PSDESTF will be modified to check for ";" in the drug item field
 and to display a message, "A semicolon is not allowed in the DRUG ITEM
 field. Please edit your entry."
