Subject: ECME # ON DIGITALLY SIGNED CS ORDERS REPORT/SUBOXONE REPORT COUNT FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Enhancements have been made to the Digitally Signed CS Orders Report [PSD 
 DIGITALLY SIGNED ORDERS] to now include the Electronic Claims Management 
 Engine (ECME) number. Additionally, the DEA DATA - Waived Practitioner 
 Report [PSD DEA SUBOXONE] has been modified to correct the patient count 
 in the summary view of the report. Previously, the summary view was 
 counting the number of prescriptions, rather than the number of patients. 
 New logic has been added to properly count the number of patients.

 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
 Patch PSD*3.0*83 will update two routines, PSDDSOR1 and PSDSUBOX.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch 
     PSD*3.0*83.
  
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
  
 4.  Select the installation option Backup a Transport Global. This 
     option will create a backup message of any routines exported with 
     this patch in case you need to backout this patch. It will not backup
     any other changes such as Data Dictionaries (DD's) or templates. It 
     is important this step be followed, because if backout of this patch 
     is necessary, having the backup will make the process much easier.
      
 5.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//', answer 'NO'.  
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//', answer 'NO'
  
 8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//', answer 'NO'.
  
 9.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0.

 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
  
 Back-out Procedures are only needed if there are major problems (examples 
 include the KIDS notice of incompletion or hard errors) resulting from the
 installation of this patch. You must have concurrence from Health Product
 Support before a rollback can occur. Enter a ServiceNow helpdesk ticket 
 to obtain this concurrence.
  
 Prior to installing a patch, the site/region should have saved a backup 
 of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport Global 
 [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install). The message 
 containing the backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" 
 function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function 
 "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up routines 
 onto the VistA System.
   
   
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
  
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the 
 PSD*3.0*83 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSD*3.0*83 in 
 the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;3.0;CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES;**[Patch List]**;Feb 13,1997;Build 10
