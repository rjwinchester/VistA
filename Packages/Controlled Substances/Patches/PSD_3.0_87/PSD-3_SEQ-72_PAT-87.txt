Description:
============

 ------------
 Patch PSD*3.0*87 corrects an issue with the BALANCE DISCREPANCY CHECK 
 prompt, as reported by a VA site after the release of PSD*3.0*84. The 
 issue is that when the PRIME VENDOR field (#12) is set to NO or null, the 
 BALANCE DISCREPANCY CHECK prompt does not appear as expected when using 
 the Create/Edit the Narcotic Area of Use [PSD NAOU EDIT] option.
  
 The routine PSDEN is modified to always display the BALANCE DISCREPANCY 
 CHECK prompt whether the PRIME VENDOR field is set to YES or NO.

 INC3380754 - BALANCE DISCREPANCY CHECK prompt not displaying when PRIME 
 VENDOR field is null or set to No
  
 Problem:
 -------
 If the PRIME VENDOR field (#12) is null or set to No, then the BALANCE 
 DISCREPANCY CHECK prompt will not show to the user.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This patch for a patch is created in support of PSD*3.0*84. PSD*3.0*84 
 added the BALANCE DISCREPANCY CHECK field (#37) to the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY
 STATS file (#58.8). Routine PSDEN is used to display fields from this file
 for editing when the LOCATION TYPE field (#1) is set to "MASTER VAULT."
 After release of PSD*3.0*84, it was discovered that if the PRIME VENDOR
 field (#12) is set to NO or null, then the BALANCE DISCREPANCY CHECK
 prompt will not display as expected. Patch PSD*3.0*87 allows the BALANCE
 DISCREPANCY CHECK field to be edited regardless of the state of the PRIME
 VENDOR field, while maintaining the original branching flow connected to
 the PRIME VENDOR field.
  
 Test Sites:

 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and

 Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option. The message containing the

 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the PSD routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the PSD routines have been

 the designation of patch PSD*3.0*87 on line 2 in the patch list section.
