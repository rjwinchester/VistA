Description:
============

 PSD*3.0*84 provides the following enhancements to VistA:
  
 - Enhances the Outpatient Rx's [PSD OUTPATIENT] option in the Pharmacist 
 Menu [PSD TRANSACTION MENU] to require users to enter the current on-hand
 narcotic medication count without seeing the VistA computed count. The
 existing option displays the VistA narcotic medication count without
 asking users to enter the actual on-hand count, which does not ensure that
 an actual count was performed to confirm that the number shown in VistA
 matches the true count. The modification ensures that an actual count is
 performed and compares the user's input against current VistA totals. If
 the balances entered by the user do not match the VistA count after three
 attempts, then an e-mail message is sent to the new CS BALANCE DISCREPANCY
 mail group for further investigation. The mail group is populated by each
 site with pharmacy personnel who have access to the Balance Adjustments
 [PSD BALANCE ADJUSTMENTS] menu to address balance discrepancies.
  
 During the post-installation phase, routine PSD84P checks to see if there 
 is a pre-existing CS BALANCE DISCREPANCY mail group. If it does not 
 exist, the routine creates the new mail group and displays an on-screen 
 confirmation. Routine PSD84P is deleted automatically at the end of patch 
 installation.
  
 This modification serves as a failsafe against narcotic diversion.
  
 This patch adds the BALANCE DISCREPANCY CHECK field (#37) to the DRUG 
 ACCOUNTABILITY STATS file (#58.8) to enable or disable use of the balance
 discrepancy modification. The new field is edited using the new "BALANCE
 DISCREPANCY CHECK:" prompt when creating or editing Master Vault
 dispensing sites. The prompt is accessed through the existing Create/Edit
 the Narcotic Area of Use [PSD NAOU EDIT] option. Users must hold the PSD
 PARAM security key to access this option. Entering "ON" (or "1") at the
 prompt will enable the discrepancy check, requiring a manual count for the
 dispensing site. Entering "OFF" (or "0") is designed for sites where
 manual counting is not practical and automated dispensing is used. The
 BALANCE DISCREPANCY CHECK field is delivered as a null (disabled) value
 for all dispensing sites at a location. A null entry in this field is the
 same as OFF.
  
 - Enhances the "Daily Activity Log (in lieu of VA FORM 10-2320)" [PSD
 DAILY LOG] option in the Production Reports [PSD PRODUCTION REPORTS] menu
 and the "Daily Activity Log (in lieu of VA FORM 10-2320)" [PSD DAILY LOG
 TECH] option in the Technician (CS Pharmacy) Menu [PSD PHARM TECH] to
 group all Schedule II drugs under one group name. The existing option
 allows a user to print all activity using the [^ALL] group selection or
 requires a user to manually input the name of each individual drug in the
 group every time a Daily Activity Log report is run. Manually inputting
 this information is a significant time burden and increases the
 possibility of data entry mistakes. This enhancement allows the user to
 enter one group name [^ALL CII DRUGS] that selects all Schedule II drugs
 instead of requiring entry of individual drug names. This group name must
 be typed in full; there is no shortcut or auto-complete.
  
 This modification ensures a more accurate report, thereby helping to
 monitor for drug diversion patterns and aiding staff in troubleshooting
 when the electronic supply count does not match the number of items
 on-hand.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 Review the Pre-Installation Instructions provided before beginning 
 installation of the patch.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system, although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes 
 to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 To install the patch:
  
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) menu, 
 select the Installation Menu. From this menu, you may elect to use the 
 following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter the patch 
 number PSD*3.0*84.
  
       a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will help 
 ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
       b. Print Transport Global - This option will enable viewing the 
 components of the KIDS build.
  
       c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
 enable viewing all changes that will be made when this patch is installed.
 It compares all components of this patch (routines, data dictionaries,
 templates, etc.).
  
       d. Back up a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
 message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not back up any
 other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and 
 choose the patch to install.
  
 5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//', 
 press <Enter>.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
 Protocols? NO//', press <Enter>.
  
 7. If prompted 'Delay install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//', press <Enter>.
  
 8. If prompted 'Enter the Device you want to print the Install messages. 
 You can queue the install by enter a 'Q' at the device prompt. Enter a 
 '^' to abort the install. DEVICE: HOME//   HOME  (CRT)', press <Enter>.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 Routine PSD84P checks to see if there is a pre-existing CS BALANCE 
 DISCREPANCY mail group. If it does not exist, the routine creates the new 
 mail group and displays an on-screen confirmation. Routine PSD84P is 
 deleted automatically at the end of patch installation.
  
 After installation is complete, each site must populate this mail group 
 with the appropriate pharmacy personnel who have access to the Balance 
 Adjustments [PSD BALANCE ADJUSTMENTS] menu to investigate and address 
 narcotic count discrepancies.
  
  
 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of this patch, it is not recommended for 
 backout, and a restore from a backup of the Transport Global should not be
 attempted. However, in the event that a site decides to back out this
 patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit a
 help desk ticket. The development team will need to issue one or more
 follow-on patches in order to comprehensively back out this patch, after
 coordination with the VA Project Manager and COR.
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the PSD routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the PSD routines have been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain the
 designation of patch PSD*3.0*84 on line 2 in the patch list section. 
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out; it does not confirm that other patch component changes 
 have been backed out.
