 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. INC000000443727 - Verify invoices and no action is taken
  
 Problem
 -------
 When a Controlled Substance follows a drug that has a quantity of 0,
 the Verify Invoices [PSA VERIFY INVOICES] routine does not create the
 Controlled Substance transaction in the Drug Accountability Transaction
 (#58.81) file.
  
 Resolution
 ----------
 Routine PSAVER6 will be modified clear the 0 quantity after verifying a
 drug with a quantity of zero.
  
 Technical
 ---------
 GETDATA+1^PSAVER6 routine will be modified to kill the PSAQTY variable. 
  
 2. INC000000212726 - Outpatient Dispensing (All Drugs) Option not working
  
 Problem
 ------- 
 When the Outpatient Dispensing (All Drugs) [PSA OP ALL DRUGS] option is
 run, no updates are being made to the Drug Accountability Transaction 
 (#58.81) file or the Drug Accountability Stats (#58.8) file.
  
 Resolution
 ----------
 Routine PSAOP4 will be modified to update the Drug Accountability Stats 
 (#58.8) file and the Drug Accountability Transaction (#58.81) file.
 Routine PSAOP2 will be modified to display the "Updating history and
 dispensing totals." message.
  
 Technical
 ---------
 STOP+1^PSAOP2 routine will be modified to display the "Updating history and
 dispensing totals." message.  The I $O(^TMP("PSA",$J,0)) will be changed to

 3. INC000000842761 - Drug Accountability - Drug File Updates
  
 Problem
 -------
 When the invoiced Price Per Order Unit is .01 and Dispense Units Per Order 
 Unit is 100, the Price Per Dispense Unit is calculating it at 0 when it
 should be .0001 during invoice processing/verifying.
  
 Resolution
 ----------
 Routine PSAVER7 will be modified to correctly calculate the Price Per
 Dispense Unit.
  
 Technical
 ---------
 The Price Per Dispense Unit variable PSANPDU in the SYNONYM+4^PSAVER7 routine
 will be modified to calculate 4 decimal points instead of 3.
