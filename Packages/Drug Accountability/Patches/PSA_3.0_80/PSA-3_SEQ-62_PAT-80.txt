 --------------------------------------------
 INC0933704 - Unable to  correct vault medication with negative balance which
              is also inactive in the drug file
         
 Problem: 
 --------
 VA Southern Nevada reported that they were unable to correct vault medication
 with negative balance which is also inactive in the drug file. The negative
 balance is caused by a problem in the Edit Verified Invoices [PSA
 EDIT VERIFIED INVOICE] option which incorrectly records transactions when
 an invoice is edited and a controlled substance drug is replaced with a
 non-controlled substance drug and vice-versa.
        
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the Edit Verified Invoices [PSA EDIT VERIFIED INVOICE] option to
 correctly record inventory transactions accordingly whether the drug is
 marked as controlled substance or not.
   
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed the routines PSAVERA, PSAVERA1 and PSAHIS1 which are responsible
 for updating the inventory transactions after a verified invoice is
 edited.

 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;3.0;DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY/INVENTORY INTERFACE;**[Patch List]**; 10/24/97
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
