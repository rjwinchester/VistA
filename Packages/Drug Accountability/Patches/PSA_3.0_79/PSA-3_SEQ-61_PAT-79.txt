Subject: DAU 3.79

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch will update the log in procedure to the Drug Accountability 
 Upload (DAU) Graphical User Interface (GUI) to use Two Factor
 Authentication (2FA) which will require the use of a Personal Identity
 Verification (PIV) card.
  
 In order to make the transition to 2FA, it was also necessary to upgrade 
 the DAU GUI to Delphi version XE8 to implement the new Remote Procedure 
 Call (RPC) Broker allowing compliance.
  
 PSA*3*79 does not update any VistA routines but does update the DAU GUI.

 OVERVIEW:
 =========
  
   Problem: 
   --------
   The Department of Veterans Affairs Cybersecurity Task Force has been 
   tasked by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Inspector General
   (IG) to address identified material weaknesses. This task force has
   mandated that all internal, user facing VA applications become Two
   Factor Authentication (2FA) compliant by April 30, 2017.
  
   In order to be compliant, applications are required to authenticate
   users via Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards.
  
  
   Note: Usernames and password will no longer be permitted for employees
         and contractors to access VA applications.
  
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The DAU program has been upgraded to Delphi XE8 to allow access 
   to the latest version of the RPC Broker, implementing 2FA.
  
   The DAU Deployment, Installation, Back-Out and Rollback Guide v1.1 
   and DAU User Manual have been updated.

 Routine Information:
 ====================
  
 No routines included.
  
 Backout Procedure:
  ==================
  Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of the 
  development team, the support team and appropriate VA site/region
  personnel. The decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint 
  decision between these groups.
  
  If needed coordinate with the appropriate IT support, local and regional,
  to schedule a time to restore the PSA_MCKESSON_UPLOAD 3.0.0.41
  previous GUI executable.
  
 Back-Out Procedure:
  
  Back-out pertains to a return to the last known good operational state of
  the software and appropriate settings. Retrieve the copy of the old 
  PSA_MCKESSON_UPLOAD Version 3.0.0.41 and restore the version to the C:\.
  
 Back-Out Strategy:
  
  A decision to back out could be made during Site Mirror Testing, during 
  Site Production Testing, or after National Release to the field (VAMCs). 
  The best strategy decision is dependent on the stage of testing during 
  which the decision is made.
  
  If a decision to back out is made after national release and within the 
  designated support period a notification will be disseminated through the
  NPM in Forum and will list all the necessary steps.
