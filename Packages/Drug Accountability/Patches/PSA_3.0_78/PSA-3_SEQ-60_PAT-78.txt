Subject: VERIFIED INVOICES NOT BEING FILED

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses one (1) issue:
  
 1. McKesson invoice verified, but controlled substance balance did
    not update
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1.  I5849148FY15
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Verified Drug Accountability (McKesson) invoices will not be set 
 to a status of Complete if the user edits the invoice, verifies, 
 and closes (or is disconnected from) their Reflections session at  
 the "Type <Enter> to continue or '^' to exit:" prompt.  This causes 
 an out-of-balance situation with regards to the controlled substance 
 vault.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 If a user edits an invoice prior to verifying, VistA routine ^PSAVER1 
 sets the invoice status to VERIFIED and prompts for the user to 
 continue or exit, via subroutine END^PSAPROC. The prompt at that point
 waits for a response.  If the user's Reflections session ends without 
 completing the final prompt, important processing is missed with 
 regards to setting up invoice data for the background job that changes 
 the status from VERIFIED to COMPLETE.
  
 To resolve this issue, the call to execute the prompt via END^PSAPROC 
 has been moved to a more appropriate spot in EXIT^PSAVER.

 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
   
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the  
    Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following
    options.  When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch #  
    (ex. PSA*3.0*78):
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not backup any
       other changes, such as DDs or templates.
    
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
       is installed. It compares all components of this patch:  routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
       
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
       global.
   
 4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    choose the patch to install.
  
 5. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
    NO//" respond NO.  
   
 6. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
  
 7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
  
 Post Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
  
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;3.0; DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY/INVENTORY INTERFACE;**[Patch 
 List]**;10/24/97;Build 10
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
