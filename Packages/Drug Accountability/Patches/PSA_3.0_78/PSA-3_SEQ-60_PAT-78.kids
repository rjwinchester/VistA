Problem:
"BLD",10747,1,12,0)
--------
"BLD",10747,1,13,0)
Verified Drug Accountability (McKesson) invoices will not be set 
"BLD",10747,1,14,0)
to a status of Complete if the user edits the invoice, verifies, 
"BLD",10747,1,15,0)
and closes (or is disconnected from) their Reflections session at  
"BLD",10747,1,16,0)
the "Type <Enter> to continue or '^' to exit:" prompt.  This causes 
"BLD",10747,1,17,0)
an out-of-balance situation with regards to the controlled substance 
"BLD",10747,1,18,0)
vault.
"BLD",10747,1,19,0)
 
"BLD",10747,1,20,0)
Resolution:
"BLD",10747,1,21,0)
-----------
"BLD",10747,1,22,0)
If a user edits an invoice prior to verifying, VistA routine ^PSAVER1 
"BLD",10747,1,23,0)
sets the invoice status to VERIFIED and prompts for the user to 
"BLD",10747,1,24,0)
continue or exit, via subroutine END^PSAPROC. The prompt at that point
"BLD",10747,1,25,0)
waits for a response.  If the user's Reflections session ends without 
"BLD",10747,1,26,0)
completing the final prompt, important processing is missed with 
"BLD",10747,1,27,0)
regards to setting up invoice data for the background job that changes 
"BLD",10747,1,28,0)
the status from VERIFIED to COMPLETE.
"BLD",10747,1,29,0)
 
"BLD",10747,1,30,0)
To resolve this issue, the call to execute the prompt via END^PSAPROC 
"BLD",10747,1,31,0)
has been moved to a more appropriate spot in EXIT^PSAVER.
