Subject: TRANSACTION HISTORY REPORT AND INVOICE PROCESSING ERROR FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following problems:
     
 1.  An oversized subscript is causing an error when processing an 
     uploaded invoice.
  
 2.  The Drug Accountability Drug Transaction History report is not 
     displaying the Inpatient transactions created during the Drug
     Accountability All Location Dispense/Purge nightly process.
  
 3.  The Drug Transaction History report does not cleanup variables if the 
     user exits (^) at the DEVICE prompt, causing an error the next time
     the report is run.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000321245 - SUBSCRIPT>LINE+45^PSAPROC7
  
    Problem:
    --------
    There are 2 problems that exist in this ticket:
    1) When processing an uploaded invoice in the Drug Accountability
       system, a hard Mumps error is occurring, caused by an over-sized
       subscript while setting the ^XTMP("PSAVSN",VSN Number) global and
       processing stops.
  
    2) When users select one of these invoices that did not finish
       processing, the application displays a message that the invoice is
       Already Marked as PROCESSED along with the Order Date, Invoice Date
       and Line Items. The Line Item's information shows the number of line
       items on the invoice and the number of line items processed. It then
       prompts the user "Do you want to compare item? NO//". After the user
       answers the compare prompt, the user receives a prompt "Do you want
       to delete the incoming invoice ? NO//", If the user answers YES,
       the unprocessed data is deleted.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    1) PSAPROC7 routine will be modified to extract only a valid VSN and
       use that value when setting the ^XTMP("PSAVSN",VSN number) global.
  
    2) PSAPTCH routine will be modified to reset the ^XTMP("PSAPV" global
       for the invoice that was left in a processing status after the error
       from processed to OK status which will allow the remainder of the
       invoice to be processed.
  
  
 2. HD0000000371516 - Only Outpatient Figures on Reports
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Drug Accountability Drug Transaction History report is not
    displaying the Inpatient transactions created during the Drug
    Accountability All Location Dispense/Purge nightly process.  This is
    caused when an Inpatient location has been set to Inactive, the
    inactivation date is stored in the ^PSD(58.8,location#,"I") global.
    When the location is reactivated, the inactivation date is set to null,
    leaving the ^PSD(58.8,location#,"I") global behind with no data. When
    the Drug Transaction History report is run, it checks for the existence
    of the ^PSD(58.8,location#,"I") global, but does not verify whether
    there is data stored in it.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    PSAUDP routine will be modified to check for the existence of data in
    the ^PSD(58.8,location#,"I") global by using a $GET function in
    addition to the $DATA function.
  
  
 3. HD0000000378864 - Drug Transaction History does not cleanup variables
                      if up caret at the device prompt.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the Drug Transaction History report and the users enters
    the "^" at the DEVICE prompt to quit, the program quits before cleaning
    up the variables. Then when the user immediately runs the report again
    and selects a different pharmacy location, the user is prompted for the
    previous pharmacy location as well as the new selection. This is caused
    by a QUIT at the DEV section of the routine.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    PSAHIS will be modified to go to the EXIT portion of the routine. The
    EXIT section  cleans up the symbol table before exiting the routine.
