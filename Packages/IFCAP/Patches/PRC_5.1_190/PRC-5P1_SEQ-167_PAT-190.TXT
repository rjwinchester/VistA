 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. INC000001082133 Amendment processing does not require delivery date
                    query when cancelling order
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When cancelling order using Amendment processing the user should not
    be asked Delivery Date.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modify routine to not ask Delivery Date when cancelling order or 
    assigning new purchase order number during amendment processing.

 2. INC0000001088195 Site received subscript error when cleansing file 424
  
    Problem:
    ---------
    Multiple sites received a subscript error when cleansing file 424 
    during year-end archive/purge processing.  The subscript error was
    caused by entries in file 424 where the Authorization Number did not
    have a sequence portion, causing the subscript error when deleting
    cross  the reference tied to the sequence number.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the cleansing routine for file 1358 DAILY RECORD [#424] and
    file 1358 AUTHORIZATION DETAIL [#424.1] to handle an entry with
    an Authorization Number with missing sequence number being purged.
    Also, extend the cleansing process to look for all potential data 
    errors and clean entries appropriately.

 3. INC0000001061745 Vendor Display option does not work for DUN & 
                     Bradstreet # lookup
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site found the DUN & Bradstreet number lookup did not work properly 
    when using option DISPLAY VENDOR.  Entering the D&B number did not pull
    up the appropriate vendor as the number MUST be preceded by DUN to do a
    proper D&B lookup, ex. DUN123456.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the option PRCH DISPLAY VENDOR to use a new routine in lieu of
    the Fileman lookup which did not present meaningful documentation when
    looking up a vendor by D&B number.  The new routine intervenes with new
    help documentation that the user must precede the D&B number with 
    'DUN'.
