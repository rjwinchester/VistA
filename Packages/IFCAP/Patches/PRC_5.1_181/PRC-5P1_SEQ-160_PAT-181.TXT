 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. INC000000755922  Purchase Card Orders - duplicate transaction numbers
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a user reaches a Sort Group query when entering a New Detailed
    Purchase Card Order [PRCH ENTER DETAILED ORDER], they sometimes close
    their connectivity to escape the order entry due to an earlier mistake
    made in an entry.  When the user returns to the order using Edit
    Detailed Purchase Card Order [PRCH EDIT DETAILED ORDER] they create a
    2nd transaction entry in file CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY (#410) pointing to
    the same order.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modify the file CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY (#410) filer for order, to set
    the cross reference pointer to the current requisition prior to asking
    Sort Group.  Upon returning to edit the order, the process will now
    have the original requisition linked to the order and not create a
    duplicate transaction.

 2. INC000000751811  Purchase order issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Problem reported that when Prompt Pay % is amended on Purchase Order, 
    the correct adjustment is not made to the FCP or the Running Balance
    report.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify PRCFFUD to insure the correct adjustment is calculated after the
    Prompt Pay Discount has been run against the order when the amended 
    order is processed back to the base order.  This will insure the Prompt
    Pay discount adjustment is based on the newly updated net amount for 
    amended order.
