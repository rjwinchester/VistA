 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1) I12358642FY17 - IFCAP - Requesting Status change on order and reporting
                    IFCAP Issue - St Cloud 
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    When a Receiving Report is being deleted the user is asked to update 
    the status. The default status is going to be what the status was 
    prior to it being deleted. The default status will not be a valid 
    input since the report has been deleted. If the input times out, the 
    Receiving Report will be deleted and the status will stay as the
    default.
  
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    When a user is prompted to delete the Receiving Report, before
    the Receiving Report is deleted the user will be asked to Update 
    the SUPPLY STATUS with a valid option. The default status will be the
    current status of the Receiving Report, and the user will be asked to
    enter a valid status. If the input timeout the status of the Receiving
    Report will default to the same status and the Receiving Report will
    not be deleted. If the user enters a valid status then the Receiving
    Report will be deleted and the status will be updated.
  
  
 2) I9421126FY16 - IFCAP - What clears out ACT,POA,PRJ msgs in 423.6
  
    Problem: 
    -------- 
    When a transaction is made in POA, ACT, and PRJ the messages are 
    not cleared out in the ISMS/FMS TRANS (#423.6) file. 
  
    Resolution:
    ----------- 
    Routines PRCOACT, and PROESE have been modified so that the POA, 
    ACT, and PRJ messages are cleared out once they have been served.
