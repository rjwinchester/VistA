 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. INC000000757524 Undefined error when amending Purchase Order 
                    item/discount
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site received error when they deleted item via Fileman.  Further
    analysis showed that items and discounts can become out of sync during
    the amendment process, causing discount calculation errors
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Processing logic was added to the Purchase Order amendment process
    where synchronization between items (and their contract info) and
    discount entries (for items and associated contract number) regardless
    of the various amendment updates a user is able to do to items or
    discount lines.  Any discrepancies found will be listed by
    discount/item with tract information for each and the reason for
    discrepancy.
  
    Here is a sample error display for the item discount sync audit during 
    amendment process:
  
 Discounts/Items discrepancies found... MUST fix either item or discount 
 listed
  
 DC-IT ITEM(s) %/AMT DISC/ITEM CONTRACT# REASON
  
 1-2   1:3      10   V796P 999A/NONE    Disc/Item contract numbers mismatch
 2-5   5        11   V796P 999A/NONE    Tampering, item has been removed
 4-8   7:8      13   V797P 999B/V797P 999A  Disc/Item contract numbers mism
  
 Error(s) MUST be fixed to approve the amendment.....
  
 Press <Enter> to return to Amendment Processing...
  
 Here is what the error list represents:
  
 a. DC-IT shows the discount entry (DC) and the item (IT) in question
 b. ITEM(s) shows the actual items as they were entered into discount node
 c. %/AMT shows the % or $$ amount as discount
 d. DISC/ITEM CONT # shows the discount contract# and the item contract#
 e. REASON is the discount/item discrepancy found that must be corrected

 2. INC000000889974 Cannot add surrogate user to PCARD via option Inquire-
                    Purchase Card Information
  
    Problem:
    ---------
    Site found that they were unable to add a surrogate user to a Purchase 
    Card when using the option Inquire-Purchase Card Information [PRCH 
    INQUIRE PURCHASE CARD]
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify processing for option PRCH INQUIRE PURCHASE CARD to ensure the
    site parameter is defined prior to the surrogate lookup in file FUND
    CONTROL POINT (#420).
