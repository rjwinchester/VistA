 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =============== 
 1. I8406036FY16 - CLO Procurement Reports (CLRS) [PRCHLO CLO PROCUREMENT] 
    - Shutdown FTP Process
  
    Problem:
    -------
    There was a decommissioning of the File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
    capability for monthly option CLO Procurement Reports (CLRS)
    [PRCHLO CLO PROCUREMENT]. The FTP feed from the option is no longer
    needed as Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) pulls the Generic Inventory
    Package (GIP) information from VistA.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Remove from Taskman the option CLO Procurement Reports (CLRS) 
    [PRCHLO CLO PROCUREMENT] and the same is set to Out of Order in the
    OPTION File (#19).
  
 Routines: PRCTDELA  (new)   pre-install
 Option: CLO Procurement Reports (CLRS) [PRCHLO CLO PROCUREMENT] set to
         Out of Order
  
 PLEASE NOTE: We still need to run the GIP Job as follows:
  
 CLO Procurement Reports (CLRS) [PRCPLO CLO GIP OPTION]
 > 1st Day of Month - 2.5 to 4 hrs after OPEN BALANCES job 
   (example 0230, 0400, etc). For example, it might be set up for
   next month as 09/01/16@0300, etc.
 > This job should only be scheduled in production; it should NEVER
   be scheduled in mirror/test.
  
 CDW pulls the GIP information for us so we no longer need the FTP 
 feed coming across. However, the CDW pull relies on the GIP task 
 running at each station on the 1st of the month (as described in the 
 option above).
  
 2. I10927149FY17 - Editing Purchase Order error for first 2237 in FCP for 
                    new fiscal year (FY)
  
    Problem:
    -------
    When creating the initial requisition for orders, the check for
    available entries will fail if the first entry for the Fund Control 
    Point (FCP) has not been created.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modify the ordering process for checking available requisition
    entries for selected FCP to manage the condition of no entries
    for new fiscal year and continue processing.
