 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. INC000000867862 Add new sub authority to Authority 3
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Add an additional sub authority 'R - PC Patient-Centered Community 
    Care' to original Authority 3 (STANDARDIZED OBLIGATIONS).
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Create post install routine PRCS180P that will add a new sub authority
    'R - PC Patient-Centered Community Care' like so in file Authority of 
    Request [#410.9]:
   
    NUMBER: 140                             AUTHORITY CODE: R
      AUTHORITY DESCRIPTION: PATIENT-CENTERED COMMUNITY CARE (PC3)  
                             CENTRALIZED ADMIN FEE
      PRIMARY AUTHORITY: 3
      VENDOR MANDATORY: YES               
      CONTRACT MANDATORY: NO
      FMS CODE: 3R
  
  
    Routines: PRCS180P (post install)
  
  
  
 2. INC000000853171 Amendment for Delivery Date with Document transmission
                    to FMS
  
    Problem:
    ---------
    Currently, only selected amendment types allow a further modification 
    of Delivery Date for an order.  Also, selected amendment types and a 
    Delivery Date change are not sufficient to allow amendment approval 
    subsequent order updating via amendment processing if approved.
  
    Also, currently, ONLY financial oriented amendments send an updating 
    document to the Financial Management System (FMS) in Austin. Hence,
    Delivery Date changes are typically not sent to FMS if done 
    independent of fiscal changes.
  
    Finally, no Delivery Date amendment changes are reflected on any order
    display/print when other fiscal oriented amendments appear.
  
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify amendment process to be able to update the Delivery Date for all
    Amendment types selected, or if no amendment type is selected.  Also, 
    allow amendment approval to proceed whenever Delivery Date is amended.
    When the amendment is processed back to the original order, insure any
    Delivery Date change creates or is included with a document 
    transmission to FMS.
  
    Also, insure that whenever the order is displayed within the IFCAP 
    system the user will now see a line item detailing that the Delivery
    Date was changed from/to.

 3. INC000000742999 Daily record entry cannot be entered 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The assignment if IENs (Internal Entry Numbers) for 1358 authorizations
    in file 1358 DAILY RECORD [#424] uses file logic with file CONTROL 
    POINT ACTIVITY [#410] as the basis of determination instead of file
    #424. Subsequent entries to file 1358 AUTHORIZATION DETAIL [#424.1] 
    will cause a filing error message for authorizations.  This would only 
    occur once a site hit the maximum number (9999) of activity entries. 
    Here is the message sites will see:
  
    "The daily record entry cannot be entered. Please see the Application
     Coordinator."
  
    Also, the user does not see redundant entries occur for the authorization
    under different IENs (Internal Entry Numbers).
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify PRCSUT3 to use the correct file 424 when assigning next  
    available internal number for 1358 and prevent colliding entries when
    subsequently assigning entries in 424.1 for authorizations and
    daily activity.
  
    Modify 1358 processing routines to set flag to insure the proper lookup
    occurs on file 424 instead of file 410.
