 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. I6588022FY16   Delivery Orders not reflecting the Prompt Pay %
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When the Delivery Switch for a site or FCP is set to 'on', the Delivery
    Order auto obligation process does not post net amount to the FCP, 
    ignoring the Prompt Pay % reduction to cost.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    For Delivery Orders (with Delivery Order switch on for auto obligate),
    modify the amount set against the FCP to be the Net amount to 
    account for Prompt Pay %.

 2. R6237345FY16   Raise order limit to $3500 for Simplified orders
  
    Problem:
    ---------
    Sites found that ancillary requisitions and Simplified Purchase Card 
    orders were limited to $3000, when the limit was increased to $3500
    on 10/01/2015 per FAR 2.101.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the processing checks for order amount in Convert Temporary 
    2237 and Simplified Purchase Card orders to raise the maximum cost 
    allowed from $3000 to $3500.

 3. I6665715FY16   Insure correct Fund Control Point (FCP) adjusted for 
                   FMS deposits received by IFCAP
  
    Problem:
    ---------
    Site found that some FMS deposits sent to site could post to 
    incorrect FCP when an order number is included that could match an
    existing order number on file, which would use the order FCP in lieu 
    of the transaction directed FCP. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the FMS deposit processing to ensure that orders having an
    extra digit are ignored and logic defaults to the transaction directed
    FCP.
