 1. I9830401FY16 - PERPETUAL INVENTORY FLAG not working correctly on 
                   Secondary Inventory Point items. 
  
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Keep Perpetual Inventory (#.5) field in the Generic Inventory
    (#445) file is not working properly when items are distributed from the
    Primary Inventory Point (IP).  If the Keep Perpetual Inventory 
    (#.5) field is set to 'NO', there should be NO accrual of quantity or
    cost of item distribution to the Secondary IP.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modify the routine to check if the Keep Perpetual Inventory (#.5) field
    in the Generic Inventory (#445) file is set to 'NO' and, if so, DO NOT
    accrue quantity or dollars for related item distribution into Secondary
    IP.
