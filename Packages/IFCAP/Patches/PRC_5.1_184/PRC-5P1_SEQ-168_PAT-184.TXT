 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. INC000000872123 Purchase Card order issue with overwriting 2237
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a site creates new Purchase Card orders, the filing process
    creates a 2237 in the CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY file (#410).  If the
    CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY file has reached the maximum (9999) entries for
    the Fund Control Point (FCP), the linking process will overwrite the
    9999 entries for FCP from that point on. This will cause multiple
    orders to be linked to the same requisition number and the Running
    Balance report to be out of balance since the previous sequence 9999
    entries will be overwritten and only last balance amount reflected in
    the totals.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Purchase Card orders that create a 2237 during the filing process will
    now check the sequence max condition as soon as the FCP is entered and
    stop the creation of a Purchase Card order when the FCP sequencing has
    reached the max entries of 9999.

 2. INC000000905800 Purchase Card accrual issue
  
    Problem:
    ---------
    Sites found that Running Balance 2237 entries were not being moved
    from one quarter to the next during the Quarterly Carry Forward
    processing.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the editing of a charge via option Edit/Remove Reconciliation so
    a user modifying a charge from 'Final Charge' status ('Yes' to 'No')
    will reset the requisition in the Running Balance Status field (#449)
    of the CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY file (#410) from 'O' to 'A'.  The status
    of 'A' will allow the Requisition to be carried forward to the next
    quarter.
