 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:

 1. INC2787789 - IFCAP-BIL-FCP/PRJ Issue:  Warning: NOT UNIQUE for fund,
                 a/o, program, fcp/prj, object class, and job!
                     
    Problem:
    --------
    When trying to edit a FCP, a warning is displayed stating that it is
    not unique. This occurs when multiple FCPs are being added to a single
    Appropriation Code. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The routine PRCB1A has been modified to allow multiple FCPs for a
    single appropriation code. 
  
 2. INC3384170 - VISTA FINANCIAL
  
    Problem:
    --------
    If a user attempts to enter/edit a no-year 1358 using menu option New 
    1358 Request [PRCEC NEW] or 2237 using option New 2237 (Service) 
    Request [PRCSENRB], but the Fiscal Year appropriation does not contain
    an uppercase 'X' or match the funds appropriation, it will display the
    user with an error saying the fiscal year is not correct. This can be
    caused because a no-year fund will have a Beginning Budget Fiscal Year
    less than the current Fiscal Year being used.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines PRCSEB and PRCEN have been modified to check the Fiscal 
    Years appropriation number in the Fund Control Point (#420) file. An 
    additional check to see if the appropriation is a no-year fund has been
    added for lowercase 'x', as well as uppercase 'X'.

 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------
 Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option. The message containing the 
 backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at 
 the Message Action prompt.  The PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE is 
 then used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA system.
