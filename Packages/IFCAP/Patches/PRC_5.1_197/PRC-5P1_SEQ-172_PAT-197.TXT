Subject: IFCAP GUI 2FA IMPLEMENTATION

Category: 
  - Other
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch will update the log in procedure to the IFCAP Logistic Data 
 query Tool GUI to use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) which will require
 the use of a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card.
  
 In order to make the transition to 2FA, it was also necessary to upgrade 
 the IFCAP Logistic Data query Tool GUI to Delphi version XE8 to implement 
 the new Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker allowing compliance.
  
 PRC*5.1*197 does not update any VistA routines but does update the IFCAP 
 Logistic Data query Tool GUI.

 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
   Problem: 
   --------
   The Department of Veterans Affairs Cybersecurity Task Force has been
   tasked by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Inspector General
   (IG) to address identified material weaknesses. This task force has
   mandated that all internal, user facing VA applications become two
   factor authentication (2FA) compliant by April 30, 2017.
  
   In order to be compliant, applications are required to authenticate
   users via Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards.
  
   Note: Usernames and password will no longer be permitted 
         for employees and contractors to access VA applications.  
   
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The IFCAP Logistic Data query Tool has been upgraded to Delphi XE8 to 
   allow access to the latest version of the RPC Broker, implementing 2FA.

 ==================== CLIENT Installation Instructions ===================
  
 *Due to differences between the install shields used for the previous
 version and this version of the IFCAP GUI, if the contents of the previous
 distribution are not removed, either manually or with the previous install
 file "remove" functionality - the new Install Project will not remove all
 contents of the application when the "remove" functionality is accessed.

    file on desktop/workstation/server.
  
 2. InstallShield Wizard pop-up displays - select 'Next'.

    'Next'.
  
 4. Select 'Install' to begin installation.
