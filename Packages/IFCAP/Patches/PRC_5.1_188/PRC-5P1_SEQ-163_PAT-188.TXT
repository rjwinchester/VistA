 Remedy Overview:
 =============== 
 1. INC000000984216 Remove 8243 from Control Point Listing w/Cost 
                    Center Exceptions
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site requests Control Point (CP) listing with Cost Center exceptions
    be modified to remove control point 8243 from exception checks.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modify routine (where cost center check is hard coded) to remove
    cost center 8243 from CP exception listing.

 2. INC000000993695 Site references need to be removed from IFCAP 
                    Technical Manual
  
    Problem:
    ---------
    Support found site references were left in the last documentation 
    update of the IFCAP Technical Manual.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the IFCAP Technical Manual by removing any site references from
    the documentation.

 3. INC000000988679 Fractional quantities being entered on inventory 
                    item receipts
  
    Problem:
    ---------
    Site was able to receive a fractional quantity even though there was
    a logical check to prevent fraction receipts, but the check was 
    bypassed due to a superfluous check based on Packaging Multiple
    and/or Unit Conversion Factor calculating to even number.
    
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Remove the superfluous check based on Packaging Multiple and/or 
    Unit Conversion Factor from the fraction receipt quantity check.
