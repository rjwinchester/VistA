 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. INC000000997485   Site not able to process fee batches against fee
                      authorizations or liquidate amounts
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site was not able to process fee batches for new authorizations or
    liquidations.  They had reached the max (9999) entries allowed, but 
    were not notified.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modify routine to alert user once total entries used against a 1358
    are greater than 9900, and for each subsequent entry thereafter. Once
    the total entries reach 9999 the user is fully warned that there are 
    no entries left to process new authorizations or liquidate a previous 
    entry.
  
    Once the max entry is met the logic will go back through to ensure no 
    entries were skipped over and could be used, allowing the user to use 
    an open entry if found.
  
    The greater than 9900 message:
  
    ** You have 78 remaining and are dangerously close to
    ** running out of Authorization entries in file 424.
    ** Authorizations and Liquidation REQUIRE available entries so you
    ** should be considering closing this obligation very soon as ONLY
    ** 9999 entries are allowed. 
  
    The reaching the max 9999 message:
    
    ** You have ZERO remaining and this is the last Authorization
    ** you will be able to enter for this 1358 (max 9999 entries). You
    ** will NO LONGER be able to liquidate any outstanding Authorizations.
    ** You MUST close this 1358 and open a new 1358 to cover further
       activity.

 2. INC0000001033606 Site was able to enter receipts twice for items 
                     on same order
  
    Problem:
    ---------
    Site was able to enter a receipt twice against an item on the same 
    order. Analysis showed that a user had created an amendment prior to
    the first receipt, and took no action on the amendment to delete item
    and escaped from the amendment process, but leaving the amendment open.
  
    After the receipt was posted against the items, a user then went back 
    to the amendment and deleted an item that had been cancelled from the 
    order, completing and approving the amendment.  This latter process 
    reset each item's receipt amount back to zero and allowed further 
    receipts to occur, since the initial amendment action copied all the 
    items when creating the base amendment record in file AMENDMENTS
    (#443.6) with each item having the to-date receipts field.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the receiving routine to ensure that the are no open amendments
    or an open amendment which has item information.  That amendment will 
    have to be completed/approved or cancelled BEFORE any receipts are 
    allowed against ordered items.

 3. INC0000001040268 Prompt Pay Percent incorrect with order/amendment 
                     processing
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site found processing issues with Prompt Pay entry with editing 
    orders and order amendments for multiple field PROMPT PAYMENT TERMS
    (#9.2) in file PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS (#442) and
    file AMENDMENTS (#443.6).
  
    The Prompt Pay Terms field is defined as a multiple, but the Prompt
    Pay amount is based on the highest percent entry in the defined 
    multiple entries for the order.  Hence, if you have entered PP% entries
    10, 15 and 20 the prompt pay discount will be calculated using the 20%.
    The user MUST know to only use entry one for adding new percent or NET 
    and when editing the field they MUST select the entry on file, not 
    simply a new value that will create subsequent multiple entries in 
    field.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the Edit order options for Incomplete Order and Delivery Order 
    to call new multiple control routine that will ONLY allow user to 
    have a single entry in the PROMPT PAY TERMS field. They will be able to
    add a new Prompt Pay entry into multiple one OR edit/delete that 
    single entry.
  
    The amendment processing for Prompt Pay Terms has been modified 
    accordingly to ONLY allow a single entry in the multiple field or the
    existing single entry to be edited or deleted.
