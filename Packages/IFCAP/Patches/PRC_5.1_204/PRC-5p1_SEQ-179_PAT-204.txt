Subject: CORRECT UNDEFINED ERRORS IN REQUEST AND PO PROCESSING

Category: 
  - Routine
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 This patch will address 5 issues:
  
 1) When a user enters a temporary transaction, exits out of the session 
 and then tries to edit that request, there will be an undefined error.
  
 2) If a user exits while creating a 2237, then edits that same 2237, but 
 times out at the field "DATE OF REQUEST", an error will occur.
  
 3) An error will occur if a temporary transaction is edited in the 2237.
  
 4) When entering a new 2237, if the user "jumps" at the "PRIORITY OF 
 REQUEST" field to the "COMMENTS" field then exits, an error occurs.
  
 5) If a fund has a multi-appropriation, the beginning budget fiscal year
 may not match the fiscal year.

 1) I18542810FY18 - AEU's vista is dropping connection while working
    Duplicates: 
           R18679358FY18 - <UNDEFINED>CHKREQ+3^PRCSEB *PRC("FY") Error
           I18740010FY18 - STX - User cannot edit order in Vista, kicks 
           R18806714FY18 - IFCAP - < UNDEFINED>CHKREQ+3^PRCSEB *PRC("FY")
           I19113233FY18 - cannot edit a Vista IFCAP request 
           I18695458FY18 - Charleston Vista kicking back to log in screen
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 In the Requestor's Menu [PRCSREQUESTOR] option, if a user uses the Enter 
 a Request (SECTION) [PRCSENRS] option to create a temporary request, and 
 then exits out proceeding to use the Edit a Request (SECTION) [PRCSEDRS] 
 option, the user will receive an error. There are 3 values that will
 become undefined upon exiting: Fiscal Year, Quarter, and Beginning Budget
 Fiscal Year. A date check occurs in the edit, but since these values are
 no longer there the user will receive an error. The error will also occur
 when using Edit 1358 Request (Section) [PRCS1358A] option.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine PRCSEA has been modified so that the values for Fiscal Year,
 Quarter, and Beginning Budget Fiscal Year will be checked to ensure they
 exist, and if not, either prompted to be entered again or created based
 off of prior information.
  
  
 2) R18702900FY18 - <UNDEFINED>CMDAT^PRCSEB0 ^PRCS(410,98342061,4) caused
    Duplicates:  
           R18789916FY18 - 2237 (578-18-2-5075-0137) caused unusual high 
           R18774943FY18 - District 2 Region 3 - Request to VistA 
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When using the New 2237 (SERVICE) REQUEST [PRCSENRB] menu option and the
 form is not completely filled out, then not all of the necessary files
 will be created. If that transaction created is now edited in the Edit a
 2237 (SERVICE) [PRCSEDTD] option, and it times out at the "DATE OF
 REQUEST" field an error will occur. Also for the options New 2237 
 (SERVICE) REQUEST [PRCSENRB], Edit a 2237 (SERVICE) [PRCSEDTD], Enter a 
 Request (SECTION) [PRCSENRS], and Edit 1358 Request (Section) 
 [PRCS1358A] if the user does not complete the Line Item and 'jumps' past
 they will encounter an infinite loop causing journaling.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine PRCSEB0 has been modified so when a user times out at the 
 "DATE OF REQUEST" field it will check for a time out and exit 
 appropriately. In addition the routines PRCSEB, PRCSEB0, and PRCSEA have
 been modified so they will re-enter the input template for Line Item if
 it is not completed.
  
  
 3) R18684786FY18 - HON WEIR 2237 patterns
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 In the Process a Request Menu [PRCSER] option, if a user uses the Edit a 
 2237 (SERVICE) [PRCSEDTD] option to edit a temporary transaction created
 in the Enter a Request (SECTION) [PRCSENRS] option, the user will receive
 an error. There are 3 values that will become undefined upon exiting:
 Fiscal Year, Quarter, and Beginning Budget Fiscal Year. A date check
 occurs in the edit, but since these values are no longer there the user
 will receive an error.
  
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine PRCSEB0 has been modified so the values for Fiscal Year, 
 Quarter, and Beginning Budget Fiscal Year will be checked to ensure they
 exist, and if not, either prompted to be entered again or created based
 off of prior information.
  
  
  
 4) R18745172FY18 - IFCAP error trap $ZE= <UNDEFINED>COMDT^PRCSEB
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 While entering a new 2237 in the New 2237 (SERVICE) REQUEST [PRCSENRB] 
 menu option, if a user "jumps" from the field "PRIORITY OF REQEUEST" to 
 "COMMENTS" and proceeds to exit using a carat, the user will receive an
 error.
    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine PRCSEB has been modified to add a check so that if there is
 a jump in New 2237 (SERVICE) REQUEST [PRCSENRB] happens the file that is 
 undefined will be protected and exit correctly.
  
  
 5) R18823347FY18 - Requesting menu option
    Duplicate:
           I18903257FY18 - IFCAP - Problem with multiple year fund and 
           R19048966FY18 - ifcap. Pharmacy is trying to enter a new 1358
  
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When using the option New 2237 (SERVICE) REQUEST [PRCSENRB] option and 
 New 1358 REQUEST (SECTION) [PRCS1358] option with a control point that 
 has multi-appropriation, a message will be prompted that the date entered
 for the field "DATE REQUIRED" does not match the fiscal year. This can 
 happen because the beginning budget fiscal year will be the starting 
 year and can increment by any number. 
    
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The routines PRCEN, PRCSEA1, and PRCSUT have been modified so a check is
 done to see if the control point selected is multi-appropriation and if 
 so, it will not require a date check. An incremental lock issue was 
 corrected in PRCSUT.
