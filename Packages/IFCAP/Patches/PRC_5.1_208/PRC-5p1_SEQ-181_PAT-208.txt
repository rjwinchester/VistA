 1) INC1350988 - IFCAP - Increase Simplified PCard orders and ancillary
                         requisitions dollar limit to $10000
    Duplicate: INC1494344  - Transaction exceeds purchase card cutoff
    
    Problem:

    Service Contract Labor Standards (SCLS) or the Wage Rate Requirements
    (Construction). Each Administrations and Staff Offices can establish
    the micro purchase limit for the individual cardholders up to $10,000.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the processing checks for order amount in Convert Temporary
    2237 and Simplified Purchase Card orders to raise the maximum cost
    allowed from $3,500 to $10,000.
