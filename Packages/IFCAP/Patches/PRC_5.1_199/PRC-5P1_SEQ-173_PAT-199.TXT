 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. I12566558FY17 - FMS Exception Report failure
  
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The option FMS Exception Transaction Report [PRCS EXCEPTION REPORT]
    fails due to an <undefined> error when using the Fileman date due to
    variable % being killed in the latest Fileman version released.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modify the routine to use different date logic for displaying the date
    on the report header.

 2. R12668308FY17 - User unable to close out consults
  
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Prosthetics GUI package for ordering is hanging at point of
    electronic signature during broker call to file order into IFCAP and
    the Fund Control Point (FCP) linked to the order has multiple Inventory
    Points attached.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modify the routine to skip the Inventory Point query for Prosthetics
    GUI orders when filing the GUI order in IFCAP.
