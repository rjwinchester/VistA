 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1) INC000000904716 - Non Supply Personnel able to enter/sign off on P.O.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    It was discover that Warehouse and Personal propert Management (PPM)
    Accountable officer were allowed to enter and sign purchase orders.
    They were able to enter any level employee into the PA/PPM/AUTHORIZED
    BUYER field (#16) in the PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS file
    (#442) and be accepted, and, in addition, sign off for their own name
    or a different name.
    
    Analysis found that the order processing defaulted PA/PPM/AUTHORIZED
    BUYER field (#16) to the user entering the order and did not check for 
    valid Supply level or see that the user was other than the Authorized
    buyer, therefore allowing user to sign off on order.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------     
    Modified Input Template PRCH2138 to clear the user set into field
    PA/PPM/AUTHORIZED BUYER eliminating the incorrect checks and forcing 
    the user to enter a valid buyer and ensuring the user ordering was the
    same as the buyer and, if not, do not allow the user to sign off on
    order.
  
  
    Routines: [none]                  Input Template:  PRCH2138
  
  
 2) INC000000924299- Cannot access Inventory Point using Abbreviated Name
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When entering a site's abbreviated name at the 'Select Primary 
    Inventory Point:' prompt in the Primary Inventory Point Main Menu
    [PRCP MAIN MENU], the associated inventory point was not found.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify PRCPUSEL to allow multiple like entries to be selected during 
    Inventory Point lookup AND add a new cross reference to the 
    ABBREIVIATED NAME field (#.8) in the GENERIC INVENTORY file (#445) by 
    using mnemonic 'CAB'.
  
    Also, a post install routine will set the new 'CAB' cross reference 
    ABBREVIATED NAME field.
  
  
    Routines: PRCPUSEL, PRCP185P (Post install)
   
    New cross reference added to ABBREVIATED NAME field:
  
       CROSS-REFERENCE:  445^CAB 
              1)= S ^PRCP(445,"CAB",$E(X,1,30),DA)=""
              2)= K ^PRCP(445,"CAB",$E(X,1,30),DA)
              This index is to allow the Inventory Point
              lookup to search index 'CAB' for abbreviated 
              name only (no attached site). 
  
  
  
  
 3) INC000000940447 - Full Purchase Card number appears under two options
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using options Procurement and Accounting Transactions Inquiry 
    [PRCF INQ 442] and Control Point Activity File Inquiry [PRCF INQ
    410],  the secure Purchase Card number will display for non-authorized
    staff to view.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify PRCFINQ (inquiry called by options) to set flag to control the
    output of PURCHASE CARD RECORD field (#451) in the 
    CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY file (#410) and
    PURCHASE CARD NUMBER field (#46) and PURCHASE CARD EXT. NO. field (#55)
    in the PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS file (#442)
  
    Routines: PRCFINQ
  
 New OUTPUT TRANSFORMS:
