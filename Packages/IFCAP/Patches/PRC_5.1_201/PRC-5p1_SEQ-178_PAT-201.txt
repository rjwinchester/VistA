 CA SDM TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) R17277139FY18 ERROR TRAP <UNDEFINED>FROM+4^PRCB1A4 *Y  
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 When a user is using the Copy Control Point User and Profiles [PRCB FCP
 USER COPY] menu option and tries to exit out, by entering double 
 carats, "^^", it will prompt them with "Select FCP to copy FROM:" again.
 After this prompt they attempt to exit by entering a carat, "^", an
 undefined error occurs.
    
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 If a user decides to exit out of the option Copy Control Point User and 
 Profiles [PRCB FCP USER COPY] it will now accept "^", "^^", and a 
 timeout. The code has been modified incase this is bypassed and will do
 the correct action.
