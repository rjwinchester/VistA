 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. INC000000752542 Site numerous approvals to be done, but no data
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Sites saw either duplicate entries in their file REQUEST WORKSHEET
    (#443) or excessive approvals to be completed when they enter the 
    Accountable Officer Menu, but when they use option Process a 
    Request in PPM [PRCHP REQST], the option shows there is nothing to
    approve.
  
  
   Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modify 5 routines to change the direct file sets to Fileman edits or
    re-indexing when the status field changes for a requisition.  One area 
    that caused the direct sets:
  
    a. When a request is processed, but status 'Returned to Service' 
       entered and then the requisition is re-edited by staff.

 2. INC000001051782 Fiscal Pending Action report issue
  
    Problem:
    ---------
    Site found that an order with an approved amendment could be overlooked
    by Fiscal (lost paper work or approved amendment alert) and they would
    not be aware to run the option 'Amendment Processing' [PRCFA 
    AMENDMENT PROCESSING] to move amended order back to original order.
    This missing process resulted in an order not being sent for 6 months.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the Fiscal Pending Action report to include any approved
    amendments against an order that needs Fiscal intervention to run
    Amendment Processing to move amendment data back to original order.
  
 Routines: PRCB2A
  
 3. INC000000952389 All/Delivery orders not auto obligating for Delivery 
                    Orders.
  
    Problem:
    ---------
    Site found that when the All/Delivery switch is on (site level or FCP 
    level) for either type that Delivery Orders DO NOT auto obligate and 
    show as not obligated on FCP Running Balance report.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routine to insure that Delivery Orders check to see if either 
    the site or FCP All/Delivery switch is on for either, and, if so, set
    the auto obligation switch to on.
