 Remedy Overview:
 =============== 
 1. I6246134FY16 Build IFCAP Annual Purge date control
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Correct the IFCAP Annual Purge process to use a universal date
    query to control incorrect date entry during the archive/purge
    process to prevent massive file data reconstruction when incorrect
    dates are entered during the purge processing.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Create a universal date query utility for the archive/purge process
    that will prevent a user from entering a more current date that 
    would cause detrimental data loss and prevent time consuming
    file restores.
  
    Only a fiscal year ending date 7+ years in arrears will be allowed.
  
    The following purge steps will be modified for the date control:
  
    STEP 1   Find Archivable IFCAP records
    STEP 5   Load IFCAP file 442 documents into PurgeMaster
    STEP 6   Load IFCAP file 410 documents into PurgeMaster
    STEP 7   Load IFCAP file 417 data into PurgeMaster
    STEP 13  FILE 423, Purge ALL Code Sheets
