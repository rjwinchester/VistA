 Ticket Overview:
 ================ 
 1. I8152049FY16 - Modify IFCAP Annual Purge option 'PRC GECS PURGE' for
                   date control
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Correct the IFCAP Annual Purge process, Step 14 (Purge Transmission 
    Records/Code Sheets), to use a universal date check to control 
    incorrect date entry during the step purge process to prevent
    massive file data reconstruction when incorrect dates are entered
    during the purge processing.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Create a universal date query check for the archive/purge process,
    Step 14, 'Purge Transmission Records/Code Sheets' that will prevent a
    user from entering a more current date that would cause detrimental 
    data loss and prevent time consuming file restores.
  
    The following purge step will be modified for the date control:
  
    STEP 14  Purge Transmission Records/Code Sheets
