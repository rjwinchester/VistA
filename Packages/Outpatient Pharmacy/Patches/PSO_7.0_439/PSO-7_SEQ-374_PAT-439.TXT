Category: 
  - Informational
  - Other

Description:
============

 FDA Medication Guides Automatic Printing Java software allows pharmacists 
 to automatically print FDA Medication Guides for a specific medication 
 when one is Available and a prescription is being filled. This software 
 must be installed on a print server for the functionality to work 
 correctly. 
                                                           
 This patch is to upgrade the FDA Medication Guides Automatic Printing 
 component to support Acrobat Reader 11.0. Windows registry keys for 
 Acrobat Reader 11 have been added to NetworkServiceTaskSetting.reg file 
 and PDFBox library JAR files have been upgraded.
  
 If your site is currently utilizing the FDA Med Guide Auto Printing 
 software using Adobe Reader 10, the updated Java Application Components in
 this release, provides the necessary components to allow sites to upgrade
 to Adobe Reader 11. Please refer to the "FDA Medication Guides Project
 Install Guide" for detailed instructions on retrieving and installing the
 necessary software.
  
 ******If your site does not utilize the FDA Med Guide Auto Printing 
 software, no further action on PSO*7*439 is necessary.******

 Patient Safety Issue:
 ---------------------
 N/A
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Automatic printing of FDA Med Guides was originally developed for use 
 with Acrobat Reader 10.0. As Acrobat Reader 11 is the latest supported 
 version in VA, Acrobat 11 automatic updates are being pushed out to the 
 Windows servers by SCCM. This breaks the FDA Med Guides Automatic 
 Printing component.
  
 This patch is to upgrade the FDA Medication Guides Automatic Printing 
 Java component to support Acrobat Reader 11.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 No code changes were made for this upgrade. The scripts were changed to 
 add Windows registry keys for Adobe Acrobat 11.
  
 Documentation Retrieval:
 ---------------------------
 The documentation can be obtained from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory 
 at one of the OI Field Offices. The preferred method is to FTP the files
 from DOWNLOAD.VISTA.DOMAIN.EXT, which will transmit the files from the
 first available server. Alternatively, sites may elect to retrieve the
 files from a specific OI Field Office.
