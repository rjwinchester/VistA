Subject: MOCHA UFT ENHANCEMENTS 2 PSO

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Medication Order Check Healthcare Application
 (MOCHA) Enhancements 2 group of patches. A host file was created to
 simplify installation at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities.
 The host file MOCHA_ENH_2_GMRA_OR_PSJ_PSO.KID contains: PSO*7*411,
 PSJ*5*281, OR*3*269 and GMRA*4*46. In addition, there is the stand alone
 patch PSS*1*175 which must be installed before the combined build.
  
 Important:  Recently released patch GMRA*4*48 contains an Allergy 
 Assessment Clean Up utility tool that produces a report that identifies 
 discrepancies between the ADVERSE REACTION ASSESSMENT file (#120.86) and
 the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8). It is imperative that GMRA*4*48 be 
 installed prior to the installation of PSO*7*411 and its associated
 patches, and that all data discrepancies identified by GMRA*4*48 have been
 corrected. If not, then installing PSO*7*411 and its associated patches
 may result in drug allergy order checks not displaying in Computerized
 Patient Record System (CPRS) and pharmacy during the medication order
 entry processes.
  
 This patch PSO*7*411 contains the following functionality:
  
 1. This patch adds BSA (m2) to the Medication Profile report [PSO P]
 option header display.
  
 2. Add to the backdoor pharmacy order entry process functionality to
 evaluate the orderable item for a specific patient using the Clinical
 Reminder Order Check (CROC) API.
  
 3. Modifies the hidden DA option to display all allergy order checks when 
 multiple allergy checks exist for an order.
  
 4. Modifies the patient information screen to display remote allergies.
  
 5. Modifies the hidden CK option to display allergy information.
  
 6. Adds functionality for requiring an intervention if the allergy is 
 severe.
  
 7. Adds sign/symptoms to allergy order check display for remote orders.

 New Service Requests (NSRs)
 ---------------------------
 20080334 - A Clinical decision Support System is being requested to 
 further enhance drug order checking to improve patient care and reduce 
 costs. This request is to address work mandated as determined by Patient
 Safety Incident (PSI) evaluation.
  
  
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs)
 ----------------------------
 457/2072 - Remedy ticket # 130757/173383/510151 - The wrong reactant is
 being displayed in the allergy check. The drug being ordered is being
 displayed as the causative agent, but now the actual causative agent will
 be displayed correctly, from the PATIENT ALLERGIES (#120.8) File.
  
 2530 - Remedy ticket # 960690/960714/975660 - Under certain circumstances,
 ordering a drug for which a patient has a remote allergy to that drug but
 no local allergy to that drug, an allergy warning is not displayed in
 Outpatient Pharmacy. Duplicate of PSI 2549.
  
 2561 - If a patient has a drug on the remote profile, but not on the local
 profile, and you enter a drug that causes a drug-drug interaction order
 check against that remote drug, the order check does not display in
 Outpatient Pharmacy.
  
 2585 - Remedy ticket # 1004240/1015745/1043694/1093605 - Erroneous
 Allergy/Interaction display
  
 2069 - CPRS and Vista Pharmacy package return inadequate alert message 
 for allergy information. Duplicate of PSI 2099.
                                             
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ----------------------------
 1. 960714 - AEU reports the site is not getting allergy checks done for 
 remote allergies when processing medication orders.
  
 Problem:
 -------
 If the remote reaction was an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) rather than an
 Allergy, the remote reaction is not firing allergy order checks in CPRS or
 in VistA Pharmacy.  It is also not displaying as a remote reaction on the
 patient information screen in VistA Pharmacy.  You can see the remote ADR
 in CPRS via Remote Data or VistaWeb.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch will correct the code to trigger an allergy alert if the 
 remote action was an ADR rather than an Allergy.
  
 2. 933381 - Incorrect allergy/drug order checks reported by the site
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Incorrect allergy/drug order checks reported by the site.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch will correct the code to report correct allergy/drug order 
 checks.
  
 3. 1055309 - Pharmacist does not see the Provider Override Reason for 
 an allergy alert when verifying an order that was finished by a 
 technician.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If an order was originally entered through CPRS and an allergy was 
 shown to the person entering the order, and a Provider Override reason 
 was entered, and a technician finishes that order in Pharmacy, the 
 technician will see that Provider Override Reason. But if that order then 
 goes into a Non-Verified state, the Pharmacist will not see that Provider
 Override reason when verifying the order.
  
 Resolution:
 ---------
 The Pharmacist will now see the same Provider Override Reason that the 
 technician saw.
     
 4. 1232967 - Drug Interactions against pending outpatient orders with only
 a PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM (#50.7) File entry assigned, but no DRUG (#50)
 File entry assigned, do not display in Outpatient Pharmacy.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If a prescription is entered through Outpatient Pharmacy that has a drug 
 interaction against an entry in the PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS (#52.41)
 File, and that pending order only has a PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM (#50.7) 
 File entry assigned, but no DRUG (#50) File entry assigned, that
 interaction order check will not display to the pharmacist.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Drug interactions against pending outpatient orders with only a PHARMACY 
 ORDERABLE ITEM (#50.7) File entry assigned, but no DRUG (#50) File entry
 assigned, will now display during the medication order entry process in
 Outpatient Pharmacy.
