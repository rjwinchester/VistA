 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
  1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
   
  2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
   
  3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
     Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may select to use the
     following options.
     
     When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch # (PSO*7.0*550):
  
     a. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this 
        patch is installed. It compares all components of this patch
        (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
  
        If you receive the following message, it is okay to 
        proceed: *** WARNING, you are missing one or more Patches ***. 
        This message is produced due to the fact that the second line of
        each routine is missing patch 504 prior to install.
  
     b. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
        transport global.
  
  4. Select the installation option Backup a Transport Global. This
     option will create a backup message of any routines exported with 
     this patch in case you need to back out this patch. It will not backup
     any other changes such as Data Dictionaries (DD's) or templates. It 
     is important this step be followed, because if back out of this patch 
     is necessary, having the backup will make the process much easier.
  
  5. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s)
     option and choose the patch to install.
  
  6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?

 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out Procedures are only needed if there are major problems (examples 
 include the KIDS notice of incompletion or hard errors) resulting from the
 installation of this patch. You must have concurrence from Health Product
 Support before a rollback can occur. Enter a ServiceNow helpdesk ticket 
 to obtain this concurrence.
  
 Prior to installing a patch, the site/region should have saved a backup 
 of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport Global 
 [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install). The message 
 containing the backed-up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan"
 function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function 
 "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed-up routines 
 onto the VistA System.
   
   
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the 
 PSO*7.0*550 patch has been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSO*7.0*550 in 
 the patch list section on line 2.
