Subject: SUSPENDED RXs GOING TOO SOON TO CMOP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects an issue that sometimes occurs for Consolidated 
 Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) refills when a refill is created prior to
 the release of the previous fill.

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1. I9899074FY16   Suspended rxs going too soon to CMOP
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 Pharmacy received an insurance reject for a refill because the date was
 changed from 5/17 (when due) to 4/23 (before the original was even due).
 After a prescription is released, the ePharmacy software changes the fill
 date for the fill, to the release date if the dates are different. This
 should only happen for the fill that was released and should not affect
 subsequent fills, however, the fill date for the subsequent fill is the
 one being changed. It was found that when a patient's PRESCRIPTION (#52)
 file record whose Fill Date (#22) field was inappropriately changed, they
 were all requested via Internet Refills and all ordered and processed
 prior to the completion/release of the CMOP fill. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine PSOBPSU2 so the appropriate fill's dates are updated (see 
 Technical Resolution).
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 The bug is in UPDFL^PSOBPSU2, which is the code that updates the Fill
 Date (#22) field of the PRESCRIPTION (#52) file and the Refill Date (#.01)
 field of the REFILL (#52) multiple of that same PRESCRIPTION (#52) file
 record (RX) that is released by CMOP. This is called by the CMOP/OPAI
 (Outpatient Automation Interface) auto-release code if the NDC is changed.
 Until now, when this was called the fill number was being passed in and
 then "newed" and reset. This should not happen, the value passed in should
 be used.
