 Description
 -----------
 The Chief Business Office (CBO) is requesting system enhancements to The
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
 Accounts Receivable (AR), Integrated Billing (IB), and Outpatient Pharmacy
 (PSO) software modules.
  
 The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of
 Information & Technology (OI&T), is to provide benefits and services to
 veterans of the United States Armed Forces. In meeting these goals, OIT
 strives to provide high quality, effective, and efficient Information
 Technology (IT) services to those responsible for providing care to the
 veterans at the point-of-care, as well as throughout all the points of the
 veterans' health care. The VA depends on Information Management /
 Information Technology (IM/IT) systems to meet mission goals.
  
 The overall FY16 HAPE (Health Administration Product Enhancements)
 Revenue Enhancement project encompasses three New Service Requests (NSR):
  
 NSR #20150506
 The Revenue Eligibility Enhancements Project effort for the CBO, bundles
 several NSRs with similar business needs into a single requirements
 document.  Successfully addressing the requirements contained within this
 document will enable the VA to appropriately bill certain subsets of
 billable events by correcting, automating, or enhancing current VistA
 systems.
  
 NSR #20150507
 The Revenue Operations Enhancements Project combines several NSRs,
 as well. This effort enables the VA to improve revenue operation
 functionality related to repayment plans, late charge capture, bill
 suspension reasons, the billing of deactivated providers, and the display
 of appeal rights and responsibilities on the Veterans Beneficiary travel
 Bill of Collections form. Implementation of the proposed enhancements will
 make a significant positive impact on stakeholders and target users.
  
 NSR #20150505
 The Revenue Reporting Enhancements Project will enable the VA to
 improve tracking and reporting of revenue, and will support revenue
 reporting business rules and guidelines.
  
  
 PSO*7.0*463 patch enhancements, pertinent to the above NSRs, include:
  
 1.) In the event of a Prescription Reset Status/Cancel Charges action,
 all automatic prepayment generation shall be eliminated.
  
 2.) All "credit balances" that are automatically generated in the event
 of a Prescription Reset Status/Cancel Charges action exemption to stop.
  
 3.) A new on-demand List Manager report will be made available for
 identification of Prescription resets.
