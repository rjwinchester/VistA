Subject: CROC ERROR FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 This patch will resolve the following issue:
  
 INC1289467 - Getting error message whenever a Pharmacist tries to 
              verify a controlled substance order entered by a Technician.
  
       
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. INC1289467 - Getting error message whenever a Pharmacist tries to 
                 verify a controlled substance order entered by a
                 Technician.
  
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 It was reported by White City that if a controlled substance order was 
 placed by pharmacy technician and the "OPIOID TREATMENT 
 REMINDER" reminder check is active and triggered by the order, the 
 software will generate a hard code error during pharmacist verifying the
 "NON-VERIFIED" order and because of that Pharmacists are not able to
 verify Technician-entered controlled substance prescriptions.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch fixes the <UNDEFINED> issue by restoring the original values
 of the needed variables.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 The <UNDEFINED> error is generated as a result of calling a Clinical 
 Reminder Order Check (CROC) which kills the VADM and VA variables. 
 This patch modifies routine PSOCROC label CK+4 to restore the VADM and VA 
 local variable arrays to the original values after calling Clinical 
 Reminder.
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Oklahoma City VAMC
 White City VAMC   
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------ 
 This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize potential
 disruption to users. This patch should take less than 2 minutes to 
 install.
   
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
   
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the  
    Installation Menu.  From this menu select Backup a Transport Global.
    When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch #  
    (ex. PSO*7.0*569):
  
 4. From the Installation Menu you may elect to use the following
    options and choose the patch when prompted:
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not
        backup any other changes, such as DDs or templates.
  
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
       is installed. It compares all components of this patch:  routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
       
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
       global.
   
 5. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    choose the patch to install.
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
    NO//" respond NO.  
   
 7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
  
 8. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Post Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 None.
  
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines 
 of the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
   ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997
    
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation
 of development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision
 between development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should
 have saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the
 Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at
 time of install). The message containing the backed up routines can
 be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action
 prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used
 to install the backed up routines onto the VistA System. 
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 Validation of Back-out Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Back-out Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2
 lines of the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option
 First Line Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines
 contained in the PSO*7.0*569 patch have been rolled back, the first
 two lines of the Routines will no longer contain the designation
 of patch PSO*7.0*569 in the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997;Build 1

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.

Routine Name: PSOCROC
    Before:  B8829845   After:  B9321087  **411,569**
