Subject: Calculation of Dosage/Other Language Expansion/HL7 delimiter

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses five issues:
  
   1. The calculation of the dosage of a prescription will not populate
      when creating an order and entering the schedule in all lower case.
  
   2. Schedules are not expanding to SPANISH. The labels are not printing
      in Spanish translated from English as necessary when creating a
      prescription in outpatient pharmacy.
  
   3. In the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Non-VA medications
      that have a sig longer than 3 words will not display in the meds tab.
  
   4. If a Health Level 7 (HL7) delimiter character is inserted into the
      comment field for Non-VA meds, the escape character is incorrectly
      stored in the global.
  
   5. Modify routine PSONVNEW so only the date is stored for the Non-VA
      med Start Date.

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
  
 1. I6075794FY16 - Calculation of Dosage Issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The calculation of the dosage of a prescription will not populate when 
 creating an order and entering the schedule in all lower case. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Added logic to routine PSOSIG so that when a user inputs a schedule all 
 letters are translated into upper case. This will allow the outpatient 
 pharmacy software to find the correct frequency for that related schedule 
 thus applying the correct dosage.  
  
  
  
 2. I6069162FY16 - OTHER LANGUAGE EXPANSION
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Schedules are not expanding to SPANISH. The labels aren't printing in 
 Spanish translated from English as necessary when creating a prescription 
 in outpatient pharmacy. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The outpatient routine PSOSPSIG uses a common sub routine for schedule 
 expansion which unfortunately does not support the expansion of other 
 language schedules. The routine will now utilize its own logic to 
 calculate the expansion of other language schedules.   
  
  
 3. I6377286FY16 - Full sig (directions) does not show for numerous non-VA 
                   meds
  
 Problem:
 -----------
 In the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Non-VA medications that 
 have a sig longer than 3 words will not display in the meds tab. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine PSONVNEW was modified to now accept free text entries in the 
 schedule that are longer than 3 words. 
  
  
 4. I9914760FY16 - HL7 Interface Issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If a HL7 delimiter character is inserted into the comment field for Non-VA
 meds (for example &), the escape HL7 character is incorrectly stored in
 the global (& is stored as \T|).  CPRS displays this correctly on the
 Orders and Meds tabs since it un-escapes the character.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSONVNEW will be modified in two places to call the CPRS code
 to un-escape the character when storing the comments for Non-VA meds.
  
 5. I9915020FY16  Non-VA meds do not display on Meds tab
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Non-VA meds do not display on the Meds Tab in CPRS if the Start Date is 
 set to NOW when creating the Non-VA med.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine PSONVNEW so only the date is stored for the Non-VA med
 Start Date.
