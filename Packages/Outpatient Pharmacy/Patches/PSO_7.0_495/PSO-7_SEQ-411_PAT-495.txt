  Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview: 
  ===========================================
  
  1. I8213786FY16 -  Using Option Reset Copay Status/Cancel Charges [PSOCP 
                     RESET COPAY STATUS] displays ALL copay exemption flags
                     after edit.
  
  Problem:
  =======
  While using option Reset Copay Status/Cancel Charges [PSOCP RESET COPAY
  STATUS] to edit copay exemption flags, when a person is automatically
  Exempt from Copay (such as Service Connected 70%) the output displays ALL
  copay exemption flag end states rather than only those copay exemptions
  that have changed. 
  
  Resolution:
  ==========
  The logic that determined whether the new exemption value was different 
  from the old was based off a node in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) that may
  not exist. Routine PSOCPC was modified so now the system compares the
  user's response to the value stored in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) to
  determine if the value has changed.
  
  2. I15627556FY17 - HARD ERROR DURING VERIFYING A DIGITALLY SIGNED 
                     PENDING ORDER 
     Rational defect ID - 561158
  
  Problem:
  =======
  When processing a digitally signed pending order, if that order is 
  auto discontinued due to an address mismatch, there is a possibility of
  getting a hard error while generating the auto discontinued mail message.
  This can happen for a patient who has a non-verified allergy and if the
  patient address was changed using the PU Patient Record Update ListMan
  action prior to processing the pending order.
   
  Resolution:
  ==========
  When the PU Patient Record Update ListMan action is used, it kills the 
  DFN variable. Modified routine PSOPKIV2 to reset variable DFN if found 
  missing and to make a call to VADPT.
  
  ROUTINE:
  =======
  At line tag ADCMAIL+1, added code,
  S:'$G(DFN) DFN=PSODFN D ^VADPT,ADD^VADPT
  At line tag PADAD+1, removed the call VADPT and ADD^VADPT as its moved
  to ADCMAIL+1
  
  3. I11377620FY17 - Controlled substance prescription hash mismatch.
  
  Problem:
  =======
  Site reports that when a controlled substance prescription hash 
  mismatch status the vista email that is generated has the incorrect 
  last four the ssn. 
  
  Resolution:
  ==========
  When generating the auto discontinued mail message, variable VA("BID") 
  that has the last 4 of the SSN is being used, which in this case happens 
  to be from a previous patient.  
  Modified routine PSOPKIV2 to ensure that the variable VA("BID") is for 
  that patient by making a call to VADPT.
  
  4. I9662455FY16 - Corrupted hash mismatch has a patient's last 4 
                    of SSN incorrect.
  
  Problem:
  =======
  Site reports that a corrupted hash mismatch has a patient's last 4 
  of SSN incorrect.
  
  Resolution:
  ==========
  When generating the auto discontinued mail message, variable VA("BID") 
  that has the last 4 of the SSN is being used, which in this case happens 
  to be from a previous patient.  
  Modified routine PSOPKIV2 to ensure that the variable VA("BID") is for 
  that patient by making a call to VADPT.
