 CA SDM Overview:
 ================
 1. I6038140FY16 - Duplicate orders erroneously allowed
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If the patient status is updated from "authorized absence" to another   
 status using the "Patient Update" action within the Patient Prescription 
 Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, and if a drug is then 
 selected which is a duplicate to another drug on the patient's profile, 
 a duplicate order is allowed.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Correct routine PSOLMPAT to reflect the proper status of the patient
 if the patient status is changed using the "Patient Update" action within
 the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option.
  
  Routine: PSOLMPAT
  
  2. I7092133FY16 - Warning messages absent when copying an order 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 During the entry of a new order in the Patient Prescription Processing
 [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option,  if a user enters a new order with a
 lower case schedule;  then enters a "conjunction"; then terminates the
 entry of the new order after receiving a warning message and then copies
 an order on the patient's profile a duplicate order can be created.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Correct routine PSOORCPY to remove the value of variable PSOSIGFL that
 should be defined for a copy function on the Patient Prescription 
 Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option.
  
  Routine: PSOORCPY
