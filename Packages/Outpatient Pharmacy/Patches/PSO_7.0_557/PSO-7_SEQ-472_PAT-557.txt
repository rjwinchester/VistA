Subject: COMPLETE ORDERS FROM OERR SECONDARY FILTER ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When choosing a primary sort of PATIENT or ROUTE and secondary sort of 
 FLAGGED, no orders are displayed. Also, when changing orderable item 
 on a prescription, if the units are omitted from the dose, the DISPENSE 
 UNITS PER DOSE field is computed incorrectly.
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. INC3902798 - PSO*7*505 Flagged Order Sorting Issue
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Patient has 2 Pending Orders, one is flagged and one is not flagged.
 If Primary sort is flagged, I see the flagged order. If primary sort is 
 Patient or Route, I see the unflagged orders. But if Primary sort is 
 Patients/all or Route, and my secondary sort is flagged, I don't see the 
 flagged order or unflagged order.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routines PSOORFI3, PSOORFI5 and PSOORFIN were modified to only exclude the
 flagged orders if the secondary sort is not flagged.
  
 2. INC3796474 - VISTA does not calculate correctly when changing orderable
 item strengths. This issue is related to Patient Safety Issue HITPS-6473.
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When changing the orderable item for a prescription, if the new dose is 
 entered without units, the default quantity displayed for dispense units 
 field is incorrect.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine PSOBKDED was modified to compute the correct dispense units even 
 if the units are omitted in the answer.
  
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 Martinsburg VAMC 
 Boise VA Medical Center

 There are no tasks or routines executed before or after the installation
 of this patch.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 minutes
 to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
 Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following
 options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch number:
 PSO*7*557
  
 a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message
 of any routines exported with this patch. It will not backup any other
 changes such as DDs or templates.
  
 b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will (allow
 you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is installed.  
 It compares all components of this patch routines, DDs, templates, etc.).

 N/A
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 -------------------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed-up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSO*7.0*557 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSO*7.0*557 in
 the patch list section on line 2.
