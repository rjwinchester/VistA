Subject: REINSTATE NOT DISCONTINUING, BINGO FILL TYPE, SCRIPTALK VARIABLE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses three (3) issues:
  
 1.      Users report that when a Window Partial is filled, the PATIENT 
         NOTIFICATION (Rx Ready) file entry (52.11) is showing the Fill
         Type as full instead of partial.
  
 2.      The PSO RX Discontinue Prescription(s) reinstate process displays 
         a Therapeutic Duplication warning message then prompts to
         discontinue the active prescription containing the duplicate
         class drug but does not discontinue the drug when "Y" is entered
         at the prompt.
  
 3.      The Outpatient Pharmacy ScripTalk label process is using %ZTIO 
         variable to write to the Prescription file's Device field. This
         is the incorrect variable.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) Overview:
 ==========================================
  
 1. I10127365FY16 - Bingo Wait Time Fill Type 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Users report that when a Window Partial is filled, the PATIENT 
 NOTIFICATION (Rx Ready) file entry (#52.11) is showing the Fill Type as 
 "F" for full instead of "P" for partial. 
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A Modification to routine PSORXPA1 to set the variable PSOFROM if a 
 condition was met and a change to routine PSORXL was made to kill the
 local array RXPR where the RX information is stored.
  
  
 2. I10129296FY16 - Discontinue Reinstate Not Discontinuing Duplicate Drug
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The PSO RX Discontinue Prescription(s) process displays a Therapeutic 
 Duplication warning message then prompts to discontinue the active  
 prescription containing the duplicate class drug but does not discontinue 
 the drug when "Y" is entered at the prompt.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified Discontinue and Reinstate Process PSOCAN1 routine to discontinue 
 the current RX after the discontinued RX has been reinstated 
  
 3. I10133616FY16 - ScripTalk %ZTIO Variable 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 I believe variable %ZTIO is a bug below. %ZTIO is never used in the 
 device manipulation in ScripTalk label process.  I don't think 
 we are capturing anything here. I just get NULL in production records.
 The Device is piece 6 of the Label node, looks like they are setting it
 in piece 5, so that's probably a mistake also.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The PSOTALK routine TRANS subroutine sets the ZTIO variable to the device 
 Internal Entry Number (IEN) then calls the % ZTLOAD routine. The %ZTLOAD 
 routine calls the %ZTLOAD1 routine; the DEVICE subroutine kills the ZTIO 
 variable before it is used to write to the PRESCRIPTION file (#52)
 (^PSRX) in the PSOTALK1 routine.
  
 The PRESCRIPTION file (#52) should contain the name of the device not the
 IEN of the device. A modification to the PSOTALK1 routine PSOTALK
 subroutine was made to write to the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) device field
 using the PSOLAP variable which contains the device name.
