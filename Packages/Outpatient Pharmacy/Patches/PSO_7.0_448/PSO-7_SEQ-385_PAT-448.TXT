 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  1. To reduce refill-too-soon third party claim rejections for new
     prescriptions, prior prescriptions will now be checked for the same
     patient and drug to verify that 3/4 of the days' supply has elapsed on the
     prior prescription before the new prescription may be filled.  When
     checking a prior prescription for the same patient and drug, the prior
     prescription cannot be in a non-verified status, the prior prescription
     must have a release date, and the prior prescription must have an
     expiration date no earlier than 120 days prior to the current date.  The
     3/4 days' supply change applies to prescriptions that are renewed, locally
     suspended, suspended via CMOP or modified using the SDC - Suspense Date
     Calc action.
  
  2. When an RRR reject is resubmitted in the foreground, and the claim
     response is E PAYABLE, the system will now display six fields of
     additional information to the user:  total amount paid, ingredient cost
     paid, amount of copay/coinsurance, dispensing fee paid, amount applied to
     periodic deductible and remaining deductible amount.
  
  3. When a claim is rejected and the user is presented with the reject
     notification, the default value will now be 'Q' (for quit) if the reject
     is related to ROI and the patient's eligibility is either TRICARE or
     CHAMPVA.
  
  4. The claim processing messages will now display Veteran eligibility,
     similar to the displays which indicate TRICARE and CHAMPVA eligibility.
  
  5. The Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] has been
     modified to contain the action VER View ePharmacy Rx on the hidden action
     menu.
  
  6. The Reject Information screen, which displays any comments on a given
     reject, has been modified to display comments entered by an Outpatient
     Pharmacy Electronic Claims Coordinator (OPECC) and flagged as being for
     the pharmacist.  (See BPS*1*20, released with this patch, which modifies
     the OPECC User Screen to allow the user to flag comments as being for the
     pharmacist.)
  
  7. The Reject Information screen has been modified to allow the user to
     perform the Resubmit action on a TRICARE or CHAMPVA non-billable
     prescription with an open pseudo-rejection code of eT or eC.  In this
     context, though the user is selecting the Resubmit action, the claim
     will be the first claim submitted for the prescription.
  
  8. The Reject Information screen has been modified to display Veteran
     eligibility at the top of the screen in the same manner as it is already
     displaying TRICARE and CHAMPVA for those eligibilities.  The Reject
     Information subsection on that screen has also been modified to display
     Veteran eligibility.
  
  9. Prior to this patch, the Reject Information screen would sometimes display
     at the top of the screen a different eligibility than it would in the
     Reject Information subsection of that same screen. That error has been
     corrected with this patch.
  
 10. If a rejected prescription has been resolved to a payable Veteran
     claim, the Reject Information screen will no longer display a reject
     type and it will now display '**' around the reject status of E
     PAYABLE.
  
 11. The Reject Information subsection of the Reject Information screen has
     been modified to display the word RESUBMISSION when a claim has been
     resubmitted from the ECME User Screen.  (This is the same place on the
     screen where the BACK-BILL indicator is already displayed.)
  
 12. Three actions have been added to the hidden action menu of the OP
     Medications edit screen.
  
        VER    View ePharmacy RX.
        RES    Resubmit Claim.  The user is not allowed to resubmit a TRICARE
               or CHAMPVA non-billable prescription from here.
        REV    Reverse Claim.
  
 13. The new Pharmacy Productivity/Revenue Report [PSO PRODUCTIVITY 
     REVENUE RPT] has been created. The option to run this report has been
     added to the ePharmacy Menu [PSO EPHARMACY MENU].  To facilitate this
     report, which identifies closed/resolved rejects according to the date
     closed/resolved, a new cross-reference has been added to file# 52
     Prescription - 'CLSDAT', which lists all closed/resolved rejects
     sorted by Closed Date/Time.
  
 14. When a resubmit is initiated from Outpatient Pharmacy, the system will now
     capture the user's name and the origin of the resubmit, which are needed
     for productivity reporting.
  
 15. The Ignored Rejects Report [PSO IGNORED REJECTS REPORT] has been modified
     to display the Billed Amount and, in the heading of the first page, the
     message 'Note: Billed Amount is what was billed and cannot be used to
     determine potential revenue.'

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named PSO7P448.
 The purpose of the post-install routine is to:
  
  a. Create an index file of all ePharmacy rejections by the date
     closed/resolved.
  b. Remove the cached hidden parent menu protocol for the Outpatient Pharmacy
     List Manager screens.
  
 The post-install routine is automatically deleted by the system if allowed by
