Description:
============

 The State Prescription Monitoring Program (SPMP) Enhancement project was
 established to further enhance the VistA SPMP functionality released by patch
 PSO*7*408 in September 2014. The SPMP VistA functionality is used to identify
 prescriptions for controlled substance drugs, Schedule 2 through 5, dispensed
 to veterans by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Outpatient Pharmacy
 facilities and to create and transmit an export file containing this
 information to the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) of each state
 on a daily basis.
  
 During the implementation of PSO*7*408, it was discovered that some states
 had unique requirements that could not be addressed by current functionality.
 As a result transmissions to those states were rejected. Patch PSO*7*451 will
 enhance the SPMP functionality to allow VHA to fulfill specific state
 requirements and successfully transmit data to those states PDMPs. This patch
 also enhances the management of Secure SHell (SSH) Keys by streamlining the
 creation of SSH Keys and restricting user access to the Private SSH Key
 content. In addition, a few miscellaneous issues have also been addressed,
 which are described below.
  
 All the changes introduced by this patch were related to the options under
 the State Prescription Monitoring Program (SPMP) Menu [PSO SPMP MENU] which
 is located under the Supervisor Functions [PSO SUPERVISOR] menu option. 
  
 The following functionality enhancements will be delivered by this patch:
  
 1. View/Edit ASAP Definitions [PSO SPMP ASAP DEFINITIONS] option
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    Some extensive enhancements have been made to this option to allow full 
    user customization of the American Society for Automation in Pharmacy
    (ASAP) data definition format (protocol) used to report outpatient
    controlled substance prescription data to the states.
  
    a) The term '/Edit' has been added to the external name of this option
       and the term 'VIEW' was removed from the internal option name.
   
    b) This option has been modified to include full customization capability 
       for the ASAP definitions 3.0 and later versions, which will allow sites 
       to fulfill states PDMPs' specific requirements. Moreover, sites will
       be able to create new ASAP versions by copying an existing one, which
       will hopefully allow them to continue transmissions well into the
       future as new ASAP versions are released and adopted by the state's
       PDMPs.
       
       Below is a list of actions that have been added to this option:
        
       CV  Copy ASAP Version  CE  Customize Element     ED  Edit Delimiters
       CS  Customize Segment  DC  Delete Customization  
   
       For more information on these new actions see the Outpatient Pharmacy
       Manager's User Manual in the State Prescription Monitoring Program
       (SPMP) section.
  
    c) Customized Data Elements and Segments will be identified by an '*' 
       (asterisk) displayed to the right of the Data Element or Segment ID.
  
 2. View/Edit SPMP State Parameters [PSO SPMP STATE PARAMETERS] option
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    A few modifications have been made to this option to support the new 
    functionality released by this patch.
  
    a) The parameter WINDOWS/NT LOCAL DIRECTORY was removed from this option
       because this module no longer supports this operating system  due to
       the increase in the complexity for handling SSH Keys and the fact that 
       VHA does not use WINDOWS/NT operating system for VistA database at any
       of its sites.
  
    b) The parameter REPORTING FREQUENCY IN DAYS was modified to allow a
       maximum value of 30 days. Before this field allowed a maximum value of
       99 days.
         
    c) A new parameter called RENAME FILE AFTER UPLOAD was added right after
       the 'FILE EXTENSION' parameter. The current transmission creates and
       sends the data file with the ".UP" file extension (for "upload"); once
       the file is transmitted a command within sFTP (Secure File Transfer 
       Protocol) is issued to rename the file to ".DAT" (or ".TXT") file
       extension. This new parameter will allow the site to control whether
       they want to keep the existing functionality by setting this parameter
       to 'YES' or if they would like to create and transmit the file without
       renaming it by setting this parameter to 'NO'. The parameter will be
       initially exported with a default value of 'YES', which is consistent
       with the existing released functionality.
  
    d) The parameters STATE SFTP SERVER IP ADDRESS and STATE SFTP SERVER
       USERNAME had their maximum value lengths increased from 30 to 60 and
       50 characters respectively to accommodate longer PDMP's DNS (Domain
       Name System) names and the usernames they assign to VHA sites.
  
    e) For security reasons the parameters SFTP PRIVATE KEY TEXT and SFTP
       PUBLIC KEY TEXT have been removed from this option as the SSH
       encryption keys content will be handled by a new option called Manage
       Secure SHell (SSH) Keys [PSO SPMP SSH KEY MANAGEMENT], which is
       described below.
   
 3. Manage Secure SHell (SSH) Keys [PSO SPMP SSH KEY MANAGEMENT] option 
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    This new option was created to automate the management of SSH encryption
    keys and to improve the security regarding their content. This new option
    will allow sites to view the public SSH key, create a new SSH key pair and
    also to delete an existing SSH key pair. In addition, this new option will
    provide an extensive help text on how the SSH keys are used in the 
    transmission process, which is shown below:
    
      Select one of the following:
  
           V         View Public SSH Key
           N         Create New SSH Key Pair
           D         Delete SSH Key Pair
           H         Help with SSH Keys
  
      Action: V// H  Help with SSH Keys
   
    Secure SHell (SSH) Encryption Keys are used to automate the data 
    transmission to the State Prescription Monitoring Programs (SPMPs). Follow
    the steps below to successfully setup SPMP transmissions from VistA to the
    state/vendor server:
  
    Step 1: Select the 'N' (Create New SSH Key Pair) Action and follow the
            prompts to create a new pair of SSH keys. If you already have an
            existing SSH Key Pair you can skip this step. You can check
            whether you already have an existing SSH Key Pair through the 'V'
            (View Public SSH Key) Action.
  
         Encryption Type: DSA or RSA?
         ----------------------------
         Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) and Rivest, Shamir & Adleman (RSA)
         are two of the most common encryption algorithms used by the IT
         industry for securely sharing data. The majority of SPMP servers can
         handle either type; however there are vendors that accept only one
         specific type. You will need to contact the SPMP vendor support to
         determine which type to select.
  
    Step 2: Share the Public SSH Key content with the state/vendor. In order
            to successfully establish SPMP transmissions the state/vendor will
            have to install/configure the new SSH Key created in step 1 for
            the user id they assigned to your site. Use the 'V' (View Public
            SSH Key) Action to retrieve the content of the Public SSH key. The
            Public SSH Key should not contain line-feed characters, therefore
            after you copy & paste it from the terminal emulator into an email
            or text editor make sure it contains only one line of text (no 
            wrapping).
   
 4. View/Export Single Prescription [PSO SPMP SINGLE RX VIEW/EXPORT] option
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    This option was modified to highlight custom Data Elements and Segments by
    changing the font appearance according to the terminal emulator settings
    for highlighted text as well as by adding an '*' (asterisk) to the right of
    the Data Element or Segment ID.
  
 5. View/Export Batch [PSO SPMP BATCH VIEW/EXPORT] and Export Batch Processing
    [PSO SPMP BATCH PROCESSING] options
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    When exporting a batch through one of these two options the users will now
    have three different choices to execute the transmission: 'B' for 
    Background (via TaskMan), which queues the transmission to be performed in
    the background through TaskMan; 'F' for Foreground, which executes the
    transmission in the foreground as it did before this patch and 'D' for
    Debug Mode (Foreground), which will execute the transmission in the
    foreground however it will display the sFTP debug steps, which can be very
    helpful for troubleshooting transmission problems. 
    Before this patch the transmission was always executed in the foreground
    which made it difficult to troubleshoot issues with the transmissions, 
    especially the scheduled transmissions, which are always executed in the
    background. Below is a screen capture of the prompt for choosing the
    transmission execution mode:
   
    Select Item(s): Quit// EXP   Export Batch  
   
    Indicate whether the transmission should be queued to run on the
    Background via TaskMan, on the Foreground (Terminal Screen) or in Debug
    Mode (Foreground)
  
       Select one of the following:
  
           B         Background
           F         Foreground
           D         Debug Mode (Foreground)
  
    Running Mode: F// 
  
 6. PSO SPMP NOTIFICATIONS Mail Group
    ---------------------------------
    The existing mail group PSO SPMP NOTIFICATIONS released by PSO*7*408 will
    be modified from type PRIVATE to PUBLIC.
  
 7. SPMP Transmission Failed MailMan Message
    ----------------------------------------
    The Mailman message generated by the SPMP Scheduled Background Job as well
    as by the (B)ackground option mentioned above for exporting a batch to the
    state was modified to include Operating System sFTP Log Information, as in
    this example from an OpenVMS environment:
  
    Subj: NEW YORK Prescription Monitoring Program Transmission Failed [#99999]
    02/29/16@12:44  26 lines
    From: SPMP TRANSMISSION  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There was a problem with the transmission of information about Controlled
    Substance prescriptions to the NEW YORK State Prescription Monitoring
    Program (SPMP).
  
    Batch #: 41
    Period : 02/29/16 thru 02/29/16
    Error  : Secure FTP Transmission failed.
  
    Please, use the option Export Batch Processing [PSO SPMP BATCH PROCESSING]
    to manually transmit this batch to the state.

 8. PSO SPMP ADMIN Security Key
    ---------------------------
    A new security key was created to restrict access to the following SPMP
    functionalities:
  
       - ASAP Definition Customization updates through the option View/Edit
         ASAP Definitions [PSO SPMP ASAP DEFINITIONS]. Visualization of the
         current ASAP Definition is not restricted.
  
       - SPMP Parameters value updates through the option View/Edit SPMP State
         Parameters [PSO SPMP STATE PARAMETERS]. Visualization of the current
         SPMP parameters is not restricted.
   
       - SSH Key generation or replacement through the option Manage Secure
         SHell (SSH) Keys [PSO SPMP SSH KEY MANAGEMENT]. Visualization of the
         current public key is not restricted.
  
 9. Misleading "File Successfully Transmitted" message for Linux OS
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    The previous algorithm used to identify whether the SPMP sFTP data
    transmission was successful was not 100% accurate for Linux Operating
    Systems. A new algorithm has been created and it should reflect the
    transmission status with much greater accuracy when transmitting data
    from a Linux based environment.
  
 10.SPMP Files Access Restrictions
    ------------------------------
    The FILE ACCESS setting for the SPMP files below will be opened up so
    users can use FileMan to view and search their content. The files were
    unintentionally released in PSO*7*408 as restricted.
  
     - SPMP ASAP RECORD DEFINITION (#58.4)
     - SPMP EXPORT BATCH (#58.42)
  
 11. Pharmacy DEA Number (ASAP Data Element PHA03)
     ---------------------------------------------
     The Pharmacy DEA# was previously retrieved from the INSTITUTION file
     (#4) through the RELATED INSTITUTION field (#100) in the OUTPATIENT
     SITE file (#59). Now, the software will look for a DEA# for the
     institution in NPI INSTITUTION field (#101) in the OUTPATIENT SITE
     file (#59). If the DEA# for the NPI Institution is blank the software
     will retrieve the DEA# for the Related Institution, like it was doing
     before this patch.

 Patch Installation: 
  
 Pre-Install Process
 -------------------
 In order to successfully install the newly improved and customizable ASAP
 definition that is being distributed by this patch we will first completely
 delete the existing content of the SPMP ASAP RECORD DEFINITION file (#58.4)
 which is where the ASAP definitions are stored.  
  
 Note: This step will happen automatically and no user action is required.
  
  
 Post-Install Process
 --------------------
 The post-install routine PSO451PI in the patch PSO*7*451 will automatically
 perform a few updates related to the SPMP functionality:
   
 - The FILE ACCESS setting for the files below will be opened up so users
   can use FileMan to view and search their content. They were unintentionally
