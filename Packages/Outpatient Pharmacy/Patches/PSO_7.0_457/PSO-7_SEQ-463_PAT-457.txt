Description:
============

 This patch will add enhancements to the Inpatient Order Entry routines for
 the National Clozapine Coordination project.  Below is a list of all the 
 applications involved in this project along with their patch numbers:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    MENTAL HEALTH (MH) V. 5.01                          YS*5.01*122
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                     PSO*7*457 
    INPATIENT MEDICATIONS (IP) V. 5.0                   PSJ*5*327
    ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING (OR) V. 3.0           OR*3*427
  
 The patches (YS*5.01*122, PSO*7*457, PSJ*5*327, and OR*3*427) are
 being released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System
 (KIDS) multi-build distribution MENTAL HEALTH NCC PROJECT 5.01.
  
 Abbreviations for terms used in the multi-build patch descriptions 
 include the National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC) located in
 Dallas, Texas; Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC); White Blood Cells (WBC);
 Initial Operating Capability (IOC); and Computerized Patient Record 
 System (CPRS).
  
 The purpose of this software package is to maintain compliance with 
 legislative and federal mandates, as well as to add Clozapine Order
 Checking to the Inpatient Pharmacy application. In addition, this 
 package replaces the weekly roll-up functionality and now transmits 
 data to the National Clozapine server nightly.
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 Modifications to ^PSOCLO1 routine.
  
 1. Added new Override reasons, 8 ;;REGISTER NON-DUTY HRS/WE (MAX 4D)
    9 ;;PRESCRIBER APPROVED 4 DAY SUPPLY 10 ;;MILD NEUTROPENIA
    PRESCRIBER APPROVED
  
 2. Modified the CHECK module to look at the ANC values instead of WBC
    as well as add more selections for the values of the PSOYS variable
    that displays the override reasons.
  
 3. Added new warning for critically low ANC readings.
  
 4. Added capability to produce a list of only active approving members
    with the "PSOLOCKCLOZ" security key to choose from for the second
    approving member for the Clozapine Override process.
  
 5. Created a view alert to be sent to the provider, member 
    approving the override, and the secondary approving member selected.
    This alert is available in CPRS. When the user double clicks on the
    alert, it will be removed from the list. 
  
 6. Inpatient Medications PSJOE was modified to detect the drug chosen.
    When a clozapine drug is chosen, the code calls the new PSJCLOZ
    routine, then uses the existing but modified outpatient medication
    routine PSOCLO1. This means both outpatient and inpatient clozapine
    orders go through the same order checks and override procedure. The
    divergence occurs when recording the override. When an outpatient is
    detected "CLOZAPINE PRESCRIPTION OVERRIDES" file (#52.52) is updated.
    And when an inpatient is detected "CLOZAPINE MEDICATION OVERRIDES"
    file (#53.8) is updated.
