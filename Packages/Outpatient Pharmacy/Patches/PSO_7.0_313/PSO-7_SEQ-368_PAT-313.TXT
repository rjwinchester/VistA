Description:
============

 This patch PSO*7*313 includes the following enhancements:
   1. Complex Orders Duration Field 
   2. Titration/Maintenance Rx 
     
 1. Complex Orders Duration Field 
 ================================
 This Enhancement is related to Patient Safety Issue PSI-07-167 and Remedy 
 Ticket # 203088. 
  
 The Outpatient Pharmacy application currently allows the entry of a complex
 order, which contains a "THEN" conjunction. This type of order is 
 allowed to leave the Duration field preceding the "THEN" conjunction 
 as null. This null duration field is causing issues when the Outpatient
 Pharmacy order was being transferred to an Inpatient Medication Order(s).
 The default stop dates were for thirty (30) days for the two (2) new
 inpatient orders created and the Start/Stop dates in the sequence were
 incorrect. The pharmacist did not notice the incorrect dates and finished
 off the orders. Upon transfer of a complex order from Outpatient Pharmacy
 to Inpatient Medication order(s), the resulting order will start at the
 first step rather than continue at the step the patient was at as an
 Outpatient. It looks like a new complex order to the finishing pharmacist,
 since the Start date is populated with the date of finishing so that the
 patient would be started on the first step, which may not be correct.
 This would pertain to complex orders that taper or titrate doses up or
 down and potentially impacts patients by receiving too much or too little
 medication.  
  
 The Outpatient Pharmacy is being modified to require the entry of a duration
 for a dose preceding a THEN conjunction if the schedule for such dose is not
 a ONE-TIME type schedule. If the dose preceding the THEN conjunction is a
 ONE-TIME type schedule the software will continue to allow the Duration field
 to be left blank (optional). The corresponding change to CPRS will be 
 done in a future CPRS patch.
  
 Example of an acceptable SIG ('NOW' is ONE-TIME type schedule): 
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 TAKE ONE TABLET BY MOUTH NOW THEN TAKE TWO TABLETS EVERY 8 HOURS 
  
 No longer acceptable SIG ('Q4H' is not ONE-TIME type schedule): 
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 TAKE ONE TABLET BY MOUTH EVERY 4 HOURS THEN TAKE TWO TABLETS EVERY 8 HOURS 
  
 Note: The SIG above is not acceptable because it does not have a 
       Duration for the first dose. In order to be acceptable the 
       SIG above would have to have a duration like the one below: 
        
       TAKE ONE TABLET BY MOUTH EVERY 4 HOURS FOR 3 DAYS THEN TAKE TWO 
       TABLETS EVERY 8 HOURS 
    
 The Duration field is not required for the dose following the last "THEN"
 conjunction.  
   
 Below is an example of a complex order being entered via Patient Prescription
 Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] 
   
     :       :
   VERB: APPLY 
   ROUTE: PO// PO   ORAL 
   Schedule: QD (EVERY DAY) 
      
   LIMITED DURATION (IN DAYS, HOURS OR MINUTES): 
   CONJUNCTION: THEN 
    
  Duration field required for the dosage entered prior to this THEN conjunction. 
  
   
   LIMITED DURATION (IN DAYS, HOURS OR MINUTES): 
     :       :
  
 2. Titration/Maintenance Rx 
 ===========================
 This Enhancement is related to PSI-06-176 and Remedy Ticket #168928.  
  
 The Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) application was modified to accommodate 
 Titration/Maintenance prescription functionality. The existing software 
 presented patient safety risks when prescriptions dispensed with a titrating
 dose followed by a maintenance dose were being copied, renewed or refilled. The
 issue was that refills as well as the new prescriptions (derived from copy,
 renewals or edits) automatically carried over the initial titrating dose into
 the new fill/prescription, which was not always the user's intention.  
  
 The new functionality provides two steps for processing Titration/ Maintenance
 prescriptions.  
  
 a. First, the user will have the ability to mark prescriptions as 
    'Titration to Maintenance' when finishing prescriptions from CPRS as 
    well as via the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR 
    ORDERS] option by invoking the new hidden action 'TM' - Mark Rx 
    as Titration. This action will result in preventing the following 
    actions to be taken on the prescription: Refill, Renewal (including 
    via CPRS), Copy and editing of any field that requires a new Rx to be 
    created. This action will also set the new field TITRATION RX FLAG 
    (#45.3) in the PRESCRIPTION File (#52) as well as the new field 
    TITRATION DOSE RX (#45.1) in the PRESCRIPTION File (#52).  
    Prescriptions that are marked as Titration/Maintenance will 
    have the letter 't' postfix to the RX # as seen below (entry #1): 
  
            :                   :                            :
                                                    ISSUE  LAST REF DAY 
    #  RX #       DRUG                       QTY ST  DATE  FILL REM SUP

            :                   :                            :
  
    Note: A prescription can be unmarked as Titration/Maintenance by 
          invoking the same TM action on an already marked prescription.  
  
   
 b. A new hidden action is being introduced in the Patient Prescription 
    Processing [LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option called TR (Convert 
    Titration Rx). This action will populate the new field MAINTENANCE 
    DOSE RX (#45.2) in the PRESCRIPTION File (#52).  
    When a titration to maintenance prescription needs to be 
    refilled so the patient can continue on the Maintenance Dose 
    this option will allow the users to create a new prescription with 
    the maintenance dose only. The process works similar to copying an 
    existing prescription, however it can only be used on prescriptions 
    with the following characteristics: 
    
      - Rx is a complex order with a THEN conjunction
      - Rx was not digitally signed
      - Rx is released 
      - Rx status is ACTIVE 
      - Rx does not have refills previously ordered 
      - Rx # Of Refills is greater than 0 (zero) 
    
    Before the new Maintenance Rx can be accepted the Pharmacist is 
    prompted to validate the QTY field for the new Rx, which may or may not
    be automatically re-calculated. Only the last dose from the original
    prescription is carried over to the new Maintenance Rx and the # of 
    Refills field is decreased by 1 because the new Maintenance Rx counts 
    as a fill. The Fill Date for the new Maintenance prescription is 
    automatically set with the next possible fill date from the existing
    prescription, which can be changed by the pharmacist.
    Once the pharmacist verifies the information for the Maintenance Rx is 
    accurate they can accept the Maintenance Rx. This action will trigger 
    a Duplicate Drug check against the original complex order, which must 
    be discontinued before the new Maintenance Rx can be accepted. 
    After the new Maintenance Rx is accepted it will have the new indicator 
    'm' on the right side of the Rx # in the patient's Medication Profile 
    as seen below (entry #1): 
  
            :                   :                            :

 c. The new Titration/Maintenance indicator (t/m) will be included in the 
    following menu options where the prescription number is displayed: 
  
    View Prescriptions                       [PSO VIEW]

    Medication Profile                       [PSO P] 
   
 d. External refill requests such as from AudioFax and Internet will not 
    be processed for Titration/Maintenance marked prescriptions.

      Drug: ZINC SULFATE 66MG TAB 
      Reason: 'Titration/Maintenance Rx' cannot be refilled.  
  
 e. CPRS refill requests will not be automatically processed for
    Titration/Maintenance marked prescriptions. The refill request will
    remain in the patient's Medication Profile as PENDING and the mailman
    message above (item d) will also be sent to PSOAUTRF security key
    holders.  
   
 f. The activity logs for both Titration and Maintenance Rx's will record 
    the corresponding Titration and Maintenance Rx # if they exist as seen 
    below:

 g. The VistA Integration Control Registration (ICR) #2398 provided to 
    Computerized Patient Record System V. 1.0 (CPRS) was modified to 
    prevent the renewal of a Titration dose order with the following 
    message: 
  
   "Prescription was marked as Titration to Maintenance Dose  by Pharmacy 
   and cannot be renewed. To repeat the titration, enter a new prescription 
   or copy the prior titration order. To continue the maintenance dose, refill 
   this prescription if refills are available or enter a new prescription for 
   the maintenance dose." 
  
  
 h. When using the Barcode Batch Prescription Entry option 
    [PSO BATCH BARCODE], if the prescription has been marked 
    as a Titration/Maintenance Rx, and the user attempts to 
    renew or refill the prescription, the following message 
    will display: 
  
    For a renewal: 
    "Rx# XXXXXX is marked as Titration Rx and cannot be renewed." 
  
    For a refill: 
    "Rx# XXXXXX is marked as Titration Rx and cannot be refilled." 
  
  
 i. The PSO HIDDEN ACTIONS Protocol in the PROTOCOL File (#101) 
    will be modified to include the two new Hidden Actions 
    introduced by this enhancement.  PSO LM BACKDOOR MARK AS 
    TITRATION and PSO LM BACKDOOR TITRATION RX REFILL are both 
    new protocols added to the PROTOCOL File (#101). 
  
  
  
  ******************************  IMPORTANT  ****************************** 
  The enhancements related to Titration/Maintenance dose Rx are made only 
  for Outpatient Pharmacy package. The corresponding changes to CPRS package 
  are not included at this time. Therefore, the CPRS Order Copy and Order 
  Change functionalities will continue to function as is. Furthermore, there 
  will be no indication of a Titration/Maintenance order in the CPRS 
  application.  
  *************************************************************************
  
 3. Remedy Ticket #1022059 
    This patch fixes an issue that could create duplicate prescriptions on 
    a patient profile. When a complex order is copied and the duration 
    field is edited, upon accepting the order, the message to discontinue
    the original order is not triggered. This causes duplicate 
    prescriptions to appear on the patient profile. This patch corrects
    this problem by prompting the user to discontinue the original order.
