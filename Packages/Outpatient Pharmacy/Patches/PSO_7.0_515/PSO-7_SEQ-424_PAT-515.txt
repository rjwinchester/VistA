Description:
============

  
                               * * * Notice * * *
                    This patch MUST BE installed immediately 
                        following successful installation 
                        of the MOCHA 2.1B group of builds.
                       See the PSO*7.0*402 and PSO*7.0*500    
                         patch descriptions for details.
                                * * * Notice * * *  
  
  
 This patch will correct 2 hard errors that are present in PSO*7.0*500, 
 which is part of the MOCHA 2.1B group of builds and is due for national 
 release at the same time.
  
 The following two errors have been addressed in this patch:
  
 <UNDEFINED>SCH+3^PSOORED3 *SCHEX
 <UNDEFINED>SCH+3^PSOORED4 *SCHEX
  
 The functions where the errors occur are:     
 - Editing the Schedule while finishing a Pending order from CPRS      
 - Editing a Schedule of an existing prescription      
 - Editing a Schedule while Verifying a Non-verified Prescription using 
   either the ListMan verification action or the  'Rx Verification by     
   Clerk' option
 - Editing a Schedule while using the 'Process Order Checks' option      
  
 This patch will also correct an issue presented with the release version 
 of PSO*7.0*500 where multiple word schedule expansions are not echoed to 
 the screen during schedule entry/edit.  This defect does not affect the 
 patient sig section where multiple word schedules continue to be expanded 
 appropriately, only the immediate echo response functionality at the time 
 of schedule entry/edit.

 Patch Installation:
 ==================
  
  Installation of this patch should take no longer than 5 minutes. 
   
  1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
  2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
     Installation menu.
   
  3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*515)
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*515.
   
  5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
   
  6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO. 
   
  7. When prompted "Device: Home//" respond with the correct device and DO 
     NOT queue this to P-Message.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:

 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
  
 Back-out Procedures are only needed if there are major problems (examples 
 include KIDS notice of incompletion or hard errors) resulting from the 
 installation of this patch. You must have concurrence from  Health 
 Product Support before a rollback can occur. Enter a CA helpdesk ticket 
 to obtain this concurrence.
  
 Prior to installing a patch, the site/region should have saved a backup 
 of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport Global 
 [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install). The message 
 containing the backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" 
 function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function 
 "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up routines 
 onto the VistA System.
   
   
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
  
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the 
 PSO*7.0*515 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSO*7.0*515 in 
 the patch list section on line 2.
  
  
 ****************************** NOTE ************************************
 The 'Before' checksum values for all routines in this patch will appear
 incorrect.  This is because they are components of the preceding
 PSO*7.0*402 and PSO*7.0*500 patches which are part of the MOCHA 2.1B group
 of builds, which this patch immediately follows. The FORUM Patch Module
 uses released checksum values to populate the 'Before' fields below.  
 Since PSO*7.0*402 and PSO*7.0*500 will be released at the same time as
 this patch the FORUM Patch Module does not have access to the actual
 'Before' checksum values.
 ****************************** NOTE *************************************
