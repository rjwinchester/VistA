Description:
============

 This patch is part of MOCHA 2.0 POST RELEASE FOLLOW UP 1.0 build that 
 includes PSJ*5*311 and PSO*7*436.
  
 This patch PSO*7*436 corrects the following issues:
  
 1. Remedy Ticket 1016418 - During finish of an order, the system has the
 ability for duplicate outpatient orders to become active when the
 processing pharmacist does not enter an electronic signature when 
 prompted during Max Single Dose order check processing. A modification has
 been made to prompt the user to discontinue duplicate drug orders after
 accept of the order when this scenario occurs. (RTC 109847) (PSPO 2598)
  
 2. When a user up-carets out of the display of dose warnings for a 
 complex order that has four or more dosing sequences, the system by-passes
 the prompts for electronic signature and intervention.  A modification
 has been made to prompt the user for electronic signature and intervention
 when the user up carets (^) during Max Single Dose order check display for
 complex orders. (RTC 45871) (PSPO 2571)
  
 3. When a user answers NO or up carets (^) at the "Are you sure you want 
 to Accept this order?" prompt during finish of an order twice in a row,
 the system does not discontinue duplicate drug and duplicate therapy
 orders. This is a legacy issue and has been corrected to discontinue 
 duplicate drug and duplicate therapy orders appropriately. (RTC 111852)
  
 4. During site testing of MOCHA 2.0, problems were reported where the
 Drug Name and/or the date in VA FileMan format can mistakenly appear in
 the Dosage field and Sig field of a PRESCRIPTION file (#52) entry or a
 PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41) entry. This was corrected with a 
 patch (PSO*7*433) only distributed to the six MOCHA 2.0 test sites. The
 correction made was for ORDERS file (#100) and in Pharmacy. In Pharmacy
 the invalid data was first removed from the appropriate Dosage fields, and
 after that the Sig was rebuilt.  New fields were added to PRESCRIPTION
 file (#52) to track these modifications.
  
 Because these modifications are part of the permanent record for each 
 order at MOCHA 2.0 test sites, the new fields are being distributed 
 nationally so that the data dictionary is standard across all VA sites. 
 Additionally these fields can be used in future.
  
 A new NATIONAL DATA UTILITY CLEANUP multiple (#725) is being added to
 PRESCRIPTION file (#52) that will contain fields for original and modified
 dosage and SIG information. Also the date of the modification, the
 functionality that initiated the clean-up and any comments about the
 cleanup. 
  
 5. For the dose warning signature prompt 'Enter your Current Signature 
 Code:', additional help text is being added.
  
    a. If the user does not enter a signature code, the following message
       will be displayed and the user will be prompted to enter their
       signature code again.
  
          WARFARIN 10MG TAB: Single dose amount of 20 MILLIGRAMS 
          exceeds the maximum single dose amount of 15 MILLIGRAMS.
  
           Enter your Current Signature Code:
  
           *** You must enter your Current Signature Code. ***
  
           Enter your Current Signature Code:
  
     b. If the user doesn't enter their signature code again, the following
        message will be displayed.
  
             *** A Signature Code must be entered to continue with this
                 order. ***
  
             Press <Enter> to return to the order...
  
      c. If the user enters one or more question marks at the "Press
         <Enter> to return to the order..." prompt, the messaged will be
         displayed again.
  
              *** A Signature Code must be entered to continue with this
                  order. ***
  
              Press <Enter> to return to the order... ?
  
              Enter either RETURN or '^'.
  
              Press <Enter> to return to the order...
