--------
"BLD",10973,1,15,0)
Outpatient pharmacists at Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center reported a
"BLD",10973,1,16,0)
glitch where a suspended Rx is edited and re-suspended appropriately but they
"BLD",10973,1,17,0)
are not being sent to CMOP. This problem happens when a new CMOP prescription
"BLD",10973,1,18,0)
is entered/finished and immediately after (without leaving the patient's
"BLD",10973,1,19,0)
profile) the user requests a partial fill on the same prescription and
"BLD",10973,1,20,0)
performs and edit on any field (e.g., QTY, FILL DATE, DAYS SUPPLY, etc.).
"BLD",10973,1,21,0)
These steps wrongly caused the prescription to be removed from the CMOP
"BLD",10973,1,22,0)
Suspense queue and placed on the Local Suspense queue.

Resolution:

-----------
"BLD",10973,1,26,0)
Outpatient Pharmacy will now check whether a partial was entered for a CMOP
"BLD",10973,1,27,0)
suspended prescription and it will not move it from the CMOP Suspense queue
"BLD",10973,1,28,0)
into the Local Suspense queue if that's the case.

Technical Resolution:

"BLD",10973,1,51,0)
did not clear the list of disabilities from the previous patient worked on
