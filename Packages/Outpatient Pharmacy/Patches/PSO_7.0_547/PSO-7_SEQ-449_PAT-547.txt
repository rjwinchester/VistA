Subject: CMOP SUSPENSE REMOVAL AND DISABILITIES LIST PROBLEMS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue.
   
 INC2842893 - Removed from CMOP Suspense, returned to OP Suspense - outpatient
              prescriptions not suspending to CMOP after PSO*7*482 SEQ #435
 INC2882730 - Erroneous SC conditions are being displayed during pharmacy
              prescription processing
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 INC2842893 - Removed from CMOP Suspense, returned to OP Suspense - outpatient
              prescriptions not suspending to CMOP after PSO*7*482 SEQ #435
           
 Problem: 
 --------
 Outpatient pharmacists at Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center reported a
 glitch where a suspended Rx is edited and re-suspended appropriately but they
 are not being sent to CMOP. This problem happens when a new CMOP prescription
 is entered/finished and immediately after (without leaving the patient's
 profile) the user requests a partial fill on the same prescription and
 performs and edit on any field (e.g., QTY, FILL DATE, DAYS SUPPLY, etc.).
 These steps wrongly caused the prescription to be removed from the CMOP
 Suspense queue and placed on the Local Suspense queue.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Outpatient Pharmacy will now check whether a partial was entered for a CMOP
 suspended prescription and it will not move it from the CMOP Suspense queue
 into the Local Suspense queue if that's the case.
    
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed the line UNSUS+1^PSOCMOPC to check whether a partial was placed by
 checking the variable RXPR and PSOFROM and it will not move the CMOP
 Suspended prescription into the Local Suspense queue.
  
 INC2882730 - Erroneous SC conditions are being displayed during pharmacy
              prescription processing
           
 Problem: 
 --------
 Outpatient pharmacists at St. Cloud VA Health Care System reported a glitch
 that started happening after patch PSO*7*514 was installed. They noticed that
 numerous male patients were showing up in outpatient pharmacy prescription
 processing as having SC conditions for ovarian disease or gynecological
 issues. When checking back to the patient information screen in VISTA
 pharmacy prescription processing or CPRS, the pharmacists discovered in many
 cases the patient was only SC for tinnitus, yet a big list of other 
 disabilities were listed at the very end of pharmacy prescription processing
 when it lists the patient's SC conditions, often with the gynecological 
 condition. After investigating the issue it was discovered PSO*7*514 changes
 did not clear the list of disabilities from the previous patient worked on
 by the user and carried them over to the subsequent patient worked on the
 same session before exiting the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM 
 BACKDOOR ORDERS] option.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option was 
 changed to properly reset the list of disabilities every time the user 
 selects a new patient.
     
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Added the command K PSODISAR at CHKPAG+1^PSOMLLD2 in order to reset the
 list of disabilities before retrieving it from the PATIENT file (#2).

 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;[DATE];[BUILD NUMBER]
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
