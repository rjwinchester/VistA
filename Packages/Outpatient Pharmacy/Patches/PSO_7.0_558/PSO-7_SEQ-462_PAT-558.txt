Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following Outpatient Pharmacy issue.
  
 INC4045365 - VPR XML file reporting for Non-VA meds outside of date range
      
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 -------------------------------------------------------------
           
 Problem: 
 ------------
 When running the VPR (Virtual Patient Record) XML extract for medications 
 there are results returned for discontinued Non-VA orders that have a 
 stop date outside of the intended date range.
      
 Resolution:
 ---------------
 The VPR XML extract process was modified to bypass the writing of any 
 discontinued Non-VA orders that have a stop date outside of the extract 
 date range.
     
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modified routine at NVA+5^PSOORRL to check for a value in stop date.
 Routine will only write to the ^TMP global used for the VPR XML extract if
 the date is within the targeted date range.

 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of

 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;** [PATCH LIST]**;[DATE];[BUILD NUMBER]
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
