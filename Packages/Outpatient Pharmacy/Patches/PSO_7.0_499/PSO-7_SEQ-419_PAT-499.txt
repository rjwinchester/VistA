Subject: One-VA Pharmacy Issues

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues.
  
 1.      I12011023FY17 - OneVA partial functionality does not restrict
                         quantity
 2.      I12010975FY17 - OneVA displaying inconsistent information
                         in VistA options
 3.      I12150112FY17 - OneVA Pharmacy Selection of Drugs by the

 1.      I12011023FY17 - OneVA partial functionality does not restrict
                         quantity
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 When doing a partial fill for a OneVA prescription, there are no
 validation checks done for Quantity.  When doing a partial fill
 for a local prescription, the validation check that the quantity
 cannot be greater than the original order quantity is done, a
 message appears to the user and they are re-prompted for the 
 quantity.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the system so validation checks are done on Quantity when 
 doing a partial fill on a OneVA prescription.
  
 Modify PRMPTXT^PSORRX1 to include validation checks for quantity.
  
  
 2.      I12010975FY17 - OneVA displaying inconsistent information in
                         VistA options
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 In menu option View Prescription [PSO VIEW], the incorrect Division
 is showing and the Pharmacist info is blank for OneVA prescription
 refills and partials.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify processing so the correct Division is displayed along with
 The Pharmacist's name that did the refill or partial.
  
 Modify PAR^PSORXVW1 to include the correct One-VA division and
 Pharmacist's name.
  
  
 3.      I12150112FY17 - Dispense drug field blank when processing/
                         selecting RX through ONEVA pharmacy software
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If there is 1:1 match, OneVA recommends the drug. If multiple possible 
 matches, OneVA presents a pick list to select from. However, on one of 
 the Rxs site tried, the matched local drug field was blank and there was 
 no list 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 If system finds no strength hits, a secondary lookup to find responses
 that would appear with "?" would be gathered and shown, and the select
 matching local drug prompt will be issued to the user.  Based on the
 filter (same as forcibly using "?" for user); the system compares
 strength of other orderable items.  Do the equivalent of what the user
 would see if users are always getting "?".  Put that result the same as
 what the current code does and then offer the prompt.  No need to inform
 user that first search failed because the determination of failure is the
 difference between orderable item dispensed drugs set up at two different
 sites.  
  
 Modify routine PSORRX1 to list possible medications prior to prompting.

 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  Staff should not be processing 
 prescriptions while patch is being installed.  This patch should take 
 less than 5 minutes to install.
  
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
    2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  From this menu, you may select to use the
       following options: 
       when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the patch # PSO*7.0*499:
  
         a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch 
            routines, DDs, templates, etc.
  
         c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
  
    4. From the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
       choose the patch to install.
  
    5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       NO//', respond NO.
  
    6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
    7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first
 2 lines of the routines contained in the patch. The second line
 will contain the patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;DEC 1997;Build 349 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] 
 can be run to compare the routine checksums to what is documented
 in the patch description.
  
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation
 of development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision
 between development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should
 have saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the
 Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at
 time of install). The message containing the backed up routines can
 be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action
 prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used
 to install the backed up routines onto the VistA System. 
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2
 lines of the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option
 First Line Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines
 contained in the PSO*7.0*499 patch have been rolled back, the first
 two lines of the Routines will no longer contain the designation
 of patch PSO*7.0*499 in the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997;Build 8

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.
