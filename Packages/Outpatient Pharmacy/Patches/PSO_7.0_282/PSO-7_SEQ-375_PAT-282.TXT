Subject: LM BACKDOOR FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 This patch will correct the following issues.
  
 1. Pharmacy schedules containing more than 3 words are not allowed in
 order processing.  This has caused some schedules such as EVERY OTHER DAY
 PRN to be rejected when processed in Outpatient Pharmacy Patient
 Prescription Processing option [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS].
  
 2. After a prescription has been returned to stock, any subsequent refill 
 being released will not update the release date in the prescription 
 profile.  This could result in an inaccurate audit of the prescription 
 release information.  
  
 3. A pre-installation utility routine from the installation of the
 Pharmacy version 7.0 software was left behind at sites and caused file
 damage when it was accidentally run.
  
 4. In CPRS, certain schedules are calculating the Quantity and/or Days
 Supply based on the frequency set by other packages instead of the
 Pharmacy Schedule of the same name.  (PSPO #812)
  
 5. Several places that evaluate data from the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file 
 (#51) are not checking the INTENDED USE field.
  
 6. When viewing prescriptions in the option "LM BACKDOOR ORDERS", viewing
 two orders consecutively and editing the dosage on one will cause the
 Patient Instructions for the first prescription to display on the second.
 (PSPO #1479)
  
 7. In CPRS, when Provide Comments include a schedule such as "QOD", the 
 schedule should expand. If the schedule is input as lowercase (qod) it 
 will not expand at all. 
  
 8. When expanding the schedule, multi word schedules were not expanding 
 correctly when a schedule exists with a name that is part of the multi 
 word schedule.
  
 ***PSS*1*119 can be installed independently of the PSO*7*282/PSJ*5*194 
 combined patch build, however the functionality will not be effective 
 until both are installed.

 Remedy ticket(s): Overview:
 ===========================
 1. INC0000000190651   Error - missing or invalid schedule.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Schedules being entered that contained more than three words were 
 previously not allowed. For example, when using the schedule "EVERY OTHER 
 DAY PRN" would be rejected when processed in Outpatient Pharmacy Patient 
 Prescription Processing option [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]. This ticket does 
 not include the correction for the CPRS entry of outpatient orders. The 
 CPRS entry correction will be contained in PSS*1*119.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Routines PSOBKDED, PSOHELP2, PSOORED4, and PSOSIG were modified to accept 
 schedule values that contain three word schedules containing "PRN" and 
 still adhere to the validation that was there previously if they did not.
  
  
 2. INC0000000100805   Return to Stock Overwrite
  
 Problem:
 --------
 After a prescription has been returned to stock, any subsequent refill 
 that is released will not update the display for the release date in the 
 prescription profile. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSOORNE2 was modified to search the refills for a release date to 
 be displayed before displaying a returned to stock date in the 
 prescription profile.
  
  
 3. INC0000000209505 - Users getting kicked out of vista
  
 Problem:  
 --------
 A pre-installation utility routine from the installation of the Pharmacy 
 version 7.0 software was left behind at sites that installed the 
 software. This routine caused system damage after being accidentally run 
 such as deleting Data Dictionary entries from multiple pharmacy files.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine PSOSTART will be removed from sites so that it cannot be run. 
  
  
 4. INC0000000207510 - Certain Schedules do not calculate quantity 
 correctly
  
 Patient Safety Issue:
 --------------------
 PSPO #812
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When outpatient pharmacy looks up the data of a schedule from the 
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) it did not check the PACKAGE PREFIX 
 field (#4) to make sure it was a pharmacy schedule.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the routine PSOSIG to check the PACKAGE PREFIX field (#4) in the
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) to make sure that outpatient pharmacy
 only looks at pharmacy schedules when looking up the data of a schedule.
  
 5. INC0000000225624 - Entries in File 51 marked as INPATIENT ONLY being 
 used by OUTPATIENT.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The INTENDED USE field (#30) in the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file (#51) is 
 not getting checked. This is allowing entries marked as INPATIENT ONLY to 
 be used in outpatient pharmacy.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Routines PSOFSIG, PSOHELP, PSOHLDS2, PSOHLPIS, PSOHLSG2, PSOHLSIG, 
 PSOLBL2, PSONVNEW, PSOQUTIL, PSOSIG, PSOSIGCX, PSOSIGDS, PSOSIGNO, 
 PSOSIGTX, PSOSPSIG, and PSOTALK1 have been modified to check the INTENDED 
 USE field (#30) whenever looking at entries in the MEDICAITON INSTRUCTION 
 file (#51).
  
 6. INC000000338673 - Patient instructions on prescription problem.
  
 Patient Safety Issue:
 --------------------
 PSPO #1479
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When using option "PSO LM BACKDOOR" if multiple prescriptions are viewed 
 consecutively and the proceeding prescription has its dosage edited, then 
 the patient instructions for the first order will be copied into the 
 patient instructions for the second order. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine PSOORNE2 was modified to kill off any remaining assets from 
 the first prescription so that they are not used when the proceeding 
 prescription is generated.  
  
 7. INC000000796512 - Translation of Provider Comments not recognizing 
 lowercase letters.
  
 Problem:
 ---------
 The user enters a lowercase abbreviation into the Provider Comments of an 
 order in CPRS.  In Outpatient Pharmacy, when the user finishes the 
 prescription and answers Yes to 'Copy Provider Comments into the Patient 
 Instructions', the abbreviation is concatenated to the Sig but does not 
 expand out.  If an uppercase abbreviation is entered, it does get 
 expanded out. Outpatient Pharmacy uses the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file 
 (#51) to expand the abbreviation.  It is not possible to enter an 
 abbreviation in lowercase letters since they are automatically translated 
 into all uppercase and stored as uppercase.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified routine PSOHELP to process any lowercase abbreviations and 
 translate to them to uppercase prior to checking for a translation in the 
 Medication Instruction File (#51).
  
 8. INC000000147667 - problem with QD schedule expanding.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If part of a defined schedule is contained in another defined schedule,
 only part of the schedule will expand. For example, if schedules QD and QD
 (DAILY) are two defined schedules, entering QD (DAILY) in a prescription
 expands to DAILY (DAILY) because only QD expanded when QD (DAILY) should
 have expanded as a single schedule.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Logic has been added to routine PSOSIG to first attempt to expand two 
 or  three word schedules before moving on to single word schedules.
  
  
 Software Retrieval:
 ===================
 The patches for this installation are combined in host file
 PSJ_194_PSO_282.KID.  Installation of this host file should be 
 coordinated among the packages of Inpatient and Outpatient Pharmacy since 
 only one installation is necessary.
  
 The patches are:
  
      PSJ*5.0*194
      PSO*7.0*282
  
 Sites may retrieve the KIDS build in one of the following ways:
  
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 download.vista.domain.ext
 which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
  
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve the patch directly from a specific
 server as follows:
  
   OIFO               FTP ADDRESS                  DIRECTORY
   --------------     ------------------------     ------------------
   Albany             ftp.domain.ext
