Subject: INBOUND ERX V3 ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Inbound Electronic Prescribing (eRx) v3 enhancements provides support for 
 new eRx message types. Enhancements have been made that allow a user 
 (pharmacist) to send a Rx Refill Request (also known as a Renewal in
 VistA) message type to the external provider that originally sent the eRx
 into VistA. After an Rx Refill Request has been sent to the external
 provider, the provider will be able to send an Rx Refill Response. New 
 functionality has been added to enable automatic and manual processing of
 Rx Refill Response messages. Enhancements have also been made to 
 support the receipt of cancel request messages, as well as the 
 generation of cancel response messages. This functionailty allows an 
 external provider to send a cancel request message to the VA pharmacy. 
 It also allows the VA to properly respond to the cancel request 
 message. The new message types will be stored along with the New Rx type
 in the ERX HOLDING QUEUE file (#52.49).
  
 The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) that supports the receipt of a incoming 
 New Rx has been enhanced to facilitate the filing and management of the 
 new message types being supported.
  
 A new hidden action 'RR' (Refill Request) has been created and attached 
 to the 'Other OP Actions' [PSO LM HIDDEN OTHER #2] protocol. This new
 action allows a user to generate a refill request from pending outpatient
 orders and backdoor order processing. This refill request is then
 sent through the eRx processing hub to the external provider who wrote 
 the prescription.
  
 New status values have been added to the ERX SERVICE REASON CODES file 
 (#52.45) in support of the new refill request, refill response, cancel
 request, cancel response, and error messages that will be received in the
 holding queue. These status values, along with the MESSAGE TYPE field
 (#.08) in the ERX HOLDING QUEUE file (#52.49) will ensure the messages can
 be differentiated.
  
 A new action has been added to the list view in the eRx holding queue. 
 This new action 'Message View' (MV) allows a user to select which types 
 of messages they wish to view. This function makes it easier for a 
 pharmacist or other use to narrow down the list of items they are viewing.
  
 A new symbol has been added as an eRx identifier in front of the 
 prescription number in Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR 
 ORDERS] and Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH]. This allows the 
 user to quickly identify eRx prescriptions. The new symbol is '&', and 
 appears in front of the prescription number (i.e. &1234567).
  
 Inbound eRx has been enhanced, and is now capable of receiving refill
 response and cancel request messages. When receiving a refill response,
 the system will now link the associated request and response messages,
 creating a relationship between the two messages. Request and response
 messages are also linked to the new prescription message or related
 message that was the source for the original prescription/communication.
  
 Inbound eRx has been enhanced to automatically process cancel requests 
 sent from an external provider. If auto-processing is successful, an 
 automated response may be built and sent to the provider automatically. 
 In some instances, the status of the eRx will be updated to an actionable 
 status. In these cases, users will now see the cancel request messages in 
 the eRx holding queue. These cancel request messages require action by the
 user to acknowledge the cancel request. In some cases, the user will be 
 asked for the type of cancel response message they would like to send 
 back to the provider (approved or denied response). A new action 'ACK' 
 (Acknowledge) can be found in the hidden actions under the eRx 
 summary/details screen.
  
 List Manager screens have been enhanced to display details about the 
 refill requests, refill responses, cancel requests, cancel responses, and 
 error messages. These screens give detailed information about the
 currently selected message type (request/response) as well as information
 related to the other linked messages. For example, if the selected message
 is a refill response, details related to the refill request are also
 displayed to the user. Additional message history information is available
 at the bottom of the list manager view.
  
 Inbound eRx has been enhanced to automatically process an 'approved' 
 refill response from the eRx holding queue, into pending outpatient 
 orders. Refill responses that are of the type 'approved with changes' can 
 be manually processed from the eRx holding queue. The only refill 
 response messages that will require manual intervention are refill 
 responses that contain a provider change.
  
 A new patient centric view has been added to inbound eRx. This view 
 provides users a more generic overview of prescription activity. The new 
 view includes information about the patient, the number of elapsed days
 the oldest eRx has been in the holding queue, and totals counts for 
 all messages that are actionable by a user. Once the user selects a 
 patient from the patient centric view, the user will be taken to a 
 prescription view. The prescription view will show only prescriptions for 
 the selected patient.
  
 A new action has been added to the summary/details view of an eRx. The 
 new 'JO' (Jump to OP) action uses the currently matched vista patient to 
 pre-select the single patient filter and jump the user directly into 
 'Complete Orders from OERR' [PSO LMOE FINISH]. This functionality 
 improves workflow and prevents users from being required to exit the 
 Inbound eRx functionality completely. The users can now use the new 
 action to jump directly to the Complete Orders from OERR option to finish 
 processing prescriptions that have been accepted from inbound eRx.
  
 ************************************************************************
 WARNING: There are two (2) known defects against PSO*7.0*508 to be 
 assigned to the eRx v3.0 Sustainment team for resolution:
  
 1) PHARM(CM) Defect 862482: Locking issue both in PCV and RX view with 
    multiple VistA sessions open.
  
    Defect Test scenario:
    If an erx pharmacist opens two VistA sessions on the same patient 
    (in both message-centric and patient-centric view) and then closes one 
    session, the lock placed by that pharmacist is removed. A second erx
    pharmacist can then edit the same patient eRx entries, simultaneously,
    as first pharmacist.
  
 2) PHARM(CM) Defect 862505: Locking issue between PCV / RX view and ERX 
    REFERENCE NUMBER, while searching(SR) the same prescription using ERX
    REFERENCE NUMBER. 
  
    Defect Test scenario:
    If a pharmacist selects a patient in both message-centric and 
    patient-centric views, and goes into a patient record for validation
    and acceptance, a second pharmacist can get into the same record by
    searching for erx reference number, thus bypassing the lock on that
    patient.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 IMPORTANT:  Please contact the PRE Inbound eRx Sustainment Team prior to 
 installing the PSO*7.0*508 patch if a pharmacy at your site is currently 
 receiving Inbound eRx prescriptions using patch PSO*7.0*527.  Email the 
 Inbound eRx Sustainment Team at inbounderx@domain.ext for support in applying 
 new configuration settings.
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch 
     #(ex. PSO*7.0*508):
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 5.  If prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//', answer 'NO'.    
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//', answer 'NO'.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//', answer 'NO'.
  
 8.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 N/A
  
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
  
 Back-out Procedures are only needed if there are major problems (examples 
 include KIDS notice of incompletion or hard errors) resulting from the 
 installation of this patch. You must have concurrence from Health Product
 Support before a rollback can occur. Enter a ServiceNow helpdesk ticket 
 to obtain this concurrence.
  
 Prior to installing a patch, the site/region should have saved a backup 
 of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport Global 
 [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install). The message 
 containing the backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" 
 function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function 
 "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up routines 
 onto the VistA System.
   
   
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
  
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
