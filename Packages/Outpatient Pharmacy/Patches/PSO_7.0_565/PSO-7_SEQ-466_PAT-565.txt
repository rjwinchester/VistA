 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview: 
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC6047771    - ERX not including info after patch PSO*7*551 
    (d)INC6131517 - Recommendations for improvements to new eRx system 
    (d)INC6087293 - Inbound eRx prescriptions not showing quantity, days 
                    supply and refills
    (d)INC6928232 - INBOUND ERX ISSUE
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 VA Sierra Nevada Health Care System reported that after the installation of the
 patch PSO*7*551 they noticed that some fields related to the eRx prescription
 (Qty, Days Supply and Refills) were no longer being displayed when viewing the
 corresponding VistA Pending Order or Active Prescription. It was confirmed that
 this issue was indeed caused by the patch PSO*7*551.  
    
 Resolution: 
 -----------
 This patch will restore the functionality accidently removed by the patch 
 PSO*7*551 by restoring the display of the fields Qty, Days Supply and Refills
 from the original external prescription (eRx).  
       
 Technical Resolution: 
 ---------------------
 Changed the routine PSOERXU1 at line tag DERX1+95 to re-include the line below
 that was removed by PSO*7*551: 
  
    S IEN=IEN+1,@GL@(IEN,0)=LINETXT 
  
  
 Test Sites: 
 -----------
 VA Sierra Nevada (Reno)
 VA Maine Health Care Systems (Togus)

 Installation Instructions: 
 --------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is recommended
 that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize potential disruption to
 users.  Staff should not be processing prescriptions while patch is being
 installed.  This patch should take less than 5 minutes to install.  
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.  
  
    2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  From this menu, you may select to use the 
       following options: 
       when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the patch # PSO*7.0*565: 
  
         a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.  
   
         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch 
            routines, DDs, templates, etc.  
  
         c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
            transport global.  
  
    4. From the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option and 
       choose the patch to install.  
  
    5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', respond NO.  
  
    6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', respond NO.  
  
    7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//' respond 0.  
  
 Installation Verification 
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of the
 routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the patch number
 in the [PATCH LIST] section.  
  
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;DEC 1997;Build 349 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run to
 compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch description.  
  
 Back-out Procedures 
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.  
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have saved
 a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport Global
 [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install). The message
 containing the backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan"
 function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK
 MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA System. 
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure 
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of the
 PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line Routine Print
 [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the PSO*7.0*565 patch
 have been rolled back, the first two lines of the Routines will no longer
 contain the designation of patch PSO*7.0*565 in the patch list section on line
 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997;Build 1

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.
