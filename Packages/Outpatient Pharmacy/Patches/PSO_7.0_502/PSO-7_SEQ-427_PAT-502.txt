Subject: SCRIPTALK ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch makes enhancements to the ScripTalk 'talking' prescription 
 label functionality. The current ScripTalk label, released in 2003, has a
 2K memory capacity, which limits the amount of prescription data that can
 be audibly read to the blind or low-vision Veteran using the system. New
 ScripTalk labels with 10K capacity are now available, and this patch takes
 advantage of that capacity by sending more prescription data, including 
 Drug Warnings, to the ScripTalk label.
  
 The data sent to the ScripTalk label (either 2K or 10K), will now be 
 controlled by one of two new parameters, depending on how your ScripTalk
 device definitions are set up. If they are set up at the system level
 using a mapped device, the dataset will be controlled by the new SCPIPTALK
 PRINTER TYPE SubField (#.03) in the SCRIPTALK PRINT DEVICE MAPPING SubFile
 (#59.747) of the PHARMACY SYSTEM File (#59.7), which patch PSS*1.0*217 
 introduces. If your ScripTalk device definition is set at the Outpatient
 Site level,the dataset will be controlled by the new SCRIPTRALK PRINTER
 TYPE Field (#107.2) in the OUTPATIENT SITE File (#59), which this patch 
 introduces. Neither of these new fields will be populated upon patch
 install, and the software assumes a 2k dataset when either parameter is
 null.
  
 The new ScripTalk 10K printers and labels are backward compatible with the
 current 2K dataset. So when a site upgrades to the new 10K equipment, once
 the hardware is set up and ready for implementation of the new 10K 
 dataset, simply set the applicable parameter to 10K.
  
 In addition, sites will now be able to control whether or not the 
 non-ScripTalk label prints as voided or not voided. This will be in the
 OUTPATIENT SITE File (#59) and will be by division (outpatient site).
  
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced 
 by this patch is available.  Please see the Outpatient Pharmacy Technical
 manual for more information regarding the new 10K dataset.
  
 Please Note: The change for the PHARMACY SYSTEM File (#59.7) is being 
 released in patch PSS*1.0*217.  Patch PSS*1.0*217 must be installed 
 before PSS*7.0*502.
  
 Also Please Note:  Make sure that the device is set up to use a Print 
 Queue.  If it is not then the 10k labels will not print.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 PSS*1.0*217 is a required patch for PSO*7.0*502.  Please install 
 PSS*1.0*217 prior to installing PSO*7.0*502.
  
 Please Note: Make sure that the device is set up to use a Print 
 Queue.  If it is not then the 10k labels will not print. 
  
 This is a setup that must be done by the IT personnel that deal with 
 defining devices, not just in the DEVICE and TERMINAL TYPE file, but also 
 at the physical setup and the operating system level.
  
 It is recommended that you verify whether or not your ScripTalk printers
 are setup to use print queues BEFORE installing PSS*1.0*217 and
 PSO*7.0*502.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 It is imperative that you perform a backup of the routines distributed 
 with this patch before installation. 
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------- 
 It is recommended that this patch be installed after normal business hours
 while no Outpatient Pharmacy users are processing orders, particularly
 anything that can potentially generate a label. It should also be
 installed when no Outpatient Pharmacy background jobs are running that can
 potentially generate a label, namely 'PRINT LABELS FROM SUSPENSE', 
 'REPRINT LABELS FROM SUSPENSE', 'Outpatient Pharmacy SUSPENSE LABELS 
 OUTPUT ROUTINE' and 'Outpatient Pharmacy LABELS OUTPUT ROUTINE'.
  
  
  Installation will take about 5 minutes.
  
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
    2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
       the Installation menu.
  
    3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*502)
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSO*7.0*502
  
    5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       NO//" respond NO.
  
    6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
       Install? NO//' 
  
    7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 If you have a 10k printer currently installed on your system, you must 
 change the ScripTalk device setup to indicate it is 10k. Otherwise, you 
 will only get the 2k output. Additional information is included in the 
 release notes as well as the technical manual.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 Data dictionary changes were included with this patch. However, those 
 changes were to add additional fields. At this time, it is not necessary 
 to rollback those changes if the decision is made to back out the patch.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum
