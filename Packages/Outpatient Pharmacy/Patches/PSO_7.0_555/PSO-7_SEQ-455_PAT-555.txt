 Problem:
 --------
 The error <UNDEFINED>DOSE1+2^PSOBKDED *PSORXED("DOSE" occurs when a user 
 edits a dosage after the following actions: 
  
   1)  When simply editing a dosage
   2)  After copying an outpatient medication
   3)  After converting a titration to maintenance
   4)  After editing the drug
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine PSOORED5 to reassign to the variable ENT based on the 
 highest element of the array PSORXED("CONJUNCTION") and adding one to the 
 value of the highest element of that array.
  
  
 ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   Install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
    
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'PSO*7.0*555'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//, 
       choose 'NO'. 
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;** [PATCH LIST]**;[DATE];[BUILD NUMBER]
   
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed-up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSS Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSO*7.0*555 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSO*1.0*555 in
 the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997;Build 5

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.
