Category:

  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 PSO*7.0*454 introduces new functionality that allows for a pharmacist to
 remotely refill a prescription from another Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical
 Center. This patch utilizes Health Level 7 (HL7) messaging to send and
 receive remote prescription details from another VA Medical Center. This
 allows a 'dispensing', or 'non-custodial' Pharmacy to refill a
 prescription that originated from another VA facility. The VA facility
 where the prescription exists is considered the 'host' Facility.
  
 VistA utilizes HL7 to send a query message to Enterprise Messaging
 Services (eMI). eMI is used to query the Health Data Repository/Clincal 
 Data Service (HDR/CDS) Repository for all active medications from all
 sites. The medications are returned to the querying site. Once the
 prescriptions are received, they are displayed below any 'local'
 prescriptions within the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR
 ORDERS] option sorted by facility. The pharmacist can then view the remote
 prescriptions, and will be able to refill or partially fill any active
 prescriptions that are not considered controlled substances at either
 facility.
  
 All remote refills are logged in a new file REMOTE PRESCRIPTION LOG file 
 (#52.09).
  
 A new option has been created to allow reporting regarding what 'remote'
 prescriptions have been filled by a particular facility, and what 
 facilities have refilled prescriptions that belong to a target facility. 
 This report is OneVA Pharmacy Prescription Report [PSO REMOTE RX REPORT].
  
 A new HL7 logical link, PSORRXSEND will facilitate the sending of the HL7
 messages to EMI. The PSO VISTA PHARM and PSO EMI PHARM application 
 parameters will control the message processing within VistA. The existing
 multi-threaded listener will be leveraged at each facility for receiving
 the HL7 messages into VistA.
  
 A new field 'OneVA Pharmacy Flag' (#3001) has been added to the Outpatient
 Site file (#59). This field will allow each division to toggle the OneVA 
 Pharmacy logic 'on' or 'off' depending on current needs. The field can be 
 changed by using VA FileMan and editing the 'OneVA Pharmacy Flag' field.
 The OneVA Pharmacy flag will be delivered to each division in the 'off'
 state.
  
 When this flag is in the 'off' state, the HDR will not be queried for 
 external prescriptions, and other facilities will not be able to refill 
 prescriptions that belong to the Outpatient site with the flag set to the 
 'off' state. When in the 'on' state, all prescription queries and actions 
 may be taken for remote queries, refills, and partial fills. In order to 
 process prescriptions from another site, that site will also need to have 
 their OneVA Pharmacy flag set to the 'on' state.
  
 DO NOT turn on the OneVA Pharmacy Flag until directed to do so. Please 
 know, OneVA Pharmacy will be rolled out nationally in in accordance to 
 the schedule as outlined in the 'Deployment/Installation' table of the
 OneVA Pharmacy Release guide or the OneVA Pharmacy Deployment,
 Installation, Back-Out, and Rollback Guide. The software will be released,
 deployed, and installed with the activation flag set to the "off"
 position.  The Existing Product Intake Program (EPIP) Implementation Team
 will coordinate with the sites' Pharmacy Automatic Data Processing
 Application Coordinator (ADPAC) on the specific date in which to activate
 the software.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 There is no pre-init functionality for the OneVA Pharmacy patch.
  
 A post-init function has been included to turn the OneVA Pharmacy flag to 
 the 'OFF' state at each Outpatient Site residing in the Outpatient Site 
 file (#59). This function will also configure the PSORRXSEND HL7 logical 
 link to be associated with each sites' domain, and will configure the 
 connection point Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) 
 vaaussoalebp2.aac.domain.ext for EMI.
