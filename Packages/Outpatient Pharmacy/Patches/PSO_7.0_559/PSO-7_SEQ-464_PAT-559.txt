Subject: ONEVA PHARAMACY ERROR - HL7 REQUEST SENT TO WRONG SITE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following issue:
  
 1. $ZE= <UNDEFINED>PROCESS+24^PSORWRAP *MW
    
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC5310207 - $ZE= <UNDEFINED>PROCESS+24^PSORWRAP *MW
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Ann Arbor VAMC reported about 5 or 6 entries in their error trap related to
 OneVA Pharmacy functionality. After some research it was determined that the
 error was happening because OneVA Pharmacy HL7 messages were being sent to
 the Ann Arbor VAMC erroneously. The prescription number in the HL7 message
 request did not exist in the Ann Arbor site as it was probably supposed to
 be sent to a different site. That was what caused the hard error reported.
 At this point it is not clear why HL7 messages have been routed the wrong
 site.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The processing of incoming HL7 messages for OneVA Pharmacy fill requests
 is being changed to check whether the prescription in the request actually
 belongs to the site it arrived. If the prescription does not exist at the
 site the message below will be displayed to the dispensing site user that
 is requesting the OneVA fill:
  
   Processing refill request. Please be patient as it may take a moment
   for the host site to respond and generate your label data...
  
   Unable to complete transaction. 
  
   The Rx #999999 does not belong to this facility (REMOTE SITE NAME). Please,
   try to place the fill request again. It may take up to 4 attempts to get a
   successful response. If the issue continues, please contact IT Support for
   assistance.
   
   Press RETURN to continue: 
      
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed the routine PSORWRAP at REMOTE+21 to verify that the prescription 
 number in the incoming OneVA HL7 message actually belongs to the site
 receiving the message. If it does not, stop processing and respond back to
 the sending site with the message above. 
    
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Oklahoma City VAMC
 Salt Lake City VAMC

 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  Staff should not be processing 
 prescriptions while patch is being installed.  This patch should take 
 less than 5 minutes to install.
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
    2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  From this menu, you may select to use the
       following options: 
       when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the patch # PSO*7.0*559:
  
         a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch 
            routines, DDs, templates, etc.
  
         c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
  
    4. From the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
       choose the patch to install.
  
    5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', respond NO.
  
    6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
    7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first
 2 lines of the routines contained in the patch. The second line
 will contain the patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;DEC 1997;Build 349 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] 
 can be run to compare the routine checksums to what is documented
 in the patch description.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation
 of development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision
 between development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should
 have saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the
 Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at
 time of install). The message containing the backed up routines can
 be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action
 prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used
 to install the backed up routines onto the VistA System. 
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 Validation of Back-out Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Back-out Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2
 lines of the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option
 First Line Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines
 contained in the PSO*7.0*559 patch have been rolled back, the first
 two lines of the Routines will no longer contain the designation
 of patch PSO*7.0*559 in the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997;Build 2

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.

Routine Name: PSORWRAP
