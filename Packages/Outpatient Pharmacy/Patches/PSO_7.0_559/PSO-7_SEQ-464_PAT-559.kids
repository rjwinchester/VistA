Problem: 
"BLD",11142,1,10,0)
--------
"BLD",11142,1,11,0)
Ann Arbor VAMC reported about 5 or 6 entries in their error trap related to
"BLD",11142,1,12,0)
OneVA Pharmacy functionality. After some research it was determined that the
"BLD",11142,1,13,0)
error was happening because OneVA Pharmacy HL7 messages were being sent to
"BLD",11142,1,14,0)
the Ann Arbor VAMC erroneously. The prescription number in the HL7 message
"BLD",11142,1,15,0)
request did not exist in the Ann Arbor site as it was probably supposed to
"BLD",11142,1,16,0)
be sent to a different site. That was what caused the hard error reported.
"BLD",11142,1,17,0)
At this point it is not clear why HL7 messages have been routed the wrong
"BLD",11142,1,18,0)
site.

-----------
"BLD",11142,1,22,0)
The processing of incoming HL7 messages for OneVA Pharmacy fill requests
"BLD",11142,1,23,0)
is being changed to check whether the prescription in the request actually
"BLD",11142,1,24,0)
belongs to the site it arrived. If the prescription does not exist at the
"BLD",11142,1,25,0)
site the message below will be displayed to the dispensing site user that
"BLD",11142,1,26,0)
is requesting the OneVA fill:
"BLD",11142,1,27,0)
 
"BLD",11142,1,28,0)
  Processing refill request. Please be patient as it may take a moment

  The Rx #999999 does not belong to this facility (REMOTE SITE NAME). Please,
"BLD",11142,1,34,0)
  try to place the fill request again. It may take up to 4 attempts to get a
"BLD",11142,1,35,0)
  successful response. If the issue continues, please contact IT Support for
"BLD",11142,1,36,0)

Technical Resolution:

---------------------
"BLD",11142,1,42,0)
Changed the routine PSORWRAP at REMOTE+21 to verify that the prescription 
"BLD",11142,1,43,0)
number in the incoming OneVA HL7 message actually belongs to the site
"BLD",11142,1,44,0)
receiving the message. If it does not, stop processing and respond back to
"BLD",11142,1,45,0)
the sending site with the message above.
