Subject: MOCHA ENHANCEMENTS 2 FOLLOW-UP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 PSO*7*458 is a maintenance patch post release of MOCHA Enhancements 2 
 (ME2) which corrects two user interface/display issues that are a part of 
 the ME2 software version. One of the two issues prevents the local 
 Station Name from appearing in certain circumstances on the allergy order 
 check display. To minimize the confusion to the end users in the field, 
 it is recommended to install this patch update be installed as soon as 
 possible and for this reason the compliance date has been set to 
 7/29/2016 shorter than the normal patch compliance window.
  
 This patch will provide bug fixes for three items identified late in the 
 testing stage of MOCHA Enhancements 2 (ME2).
  
 Issue 1 (RTC 278670):  Removed unnecessary 'Press Return to Continue' 
 prompts under certain circumstances related to duplicate therapy warnings 
 with discontinued scripts.
  
 Solution 1: This issue was fixed with a simple change to one routine in 
 the Outpatient Pharmacy application. No data changes were involved. The 
 only change the user will notice is that in the scenario which the patch 
 addresses, the user will only see one 'Press Return to Continue' prompt, 
 and not the erroneous second prompt.
  
 Issue 2 (RTC 200277/287822): Certain circumstances were preventing the
 display of local site information for allergy cases where a remote site
 had the same severity, reactant, and observed/historical status.  The
 circumstances are now accounted for in display sorting so all sites, local
 or remote, will display as required.
  
 Solution 2: This issue was fixed with a simple change to one routine in 
 the Outpatient Pharmacy application. No data changes were involved. The 
 only change the user will notice is that in the scenario which the patch 
 addresses, the user will see that the allergy that has caused the alert 
 was entered in the local facility, in addition to the remote 
 facility(ies).
         
 Issue 3 (RTC 323484): When using the CK 'Check Interactions' Hidden Action
 in Outpatient Pharmacy, if the first drug/item alphabetically in the
 patient profile is marked as supply item in the DRUG File (#50), and the 
 user enters <ret> at the 'Drug' prompt, drug interaction and duplicate 
 therapy order checks will not display for the profile drug/items.
  
 Solution 3: This issue was fixed with a simple change to one routine in 
 the Outpatient Pharmacy application. No data changes were involved. The 
 routine that initiates the drug interaction and duplicate therapy order
 checks does a check on the supply status of the first drug/item in the
 patient profile list, and if it is a supply, it will not do these order
 checks. That logic is valid for the order entry process, since profile
 drug/items are not checked against each other during order entry, and the
 first drug/item in the profile list is the drug/item being ordered
 (prospective drug). This same logic is applied to the CK Hidden Action,
 but for the CK Hidden Action, the first drug/item in the list
 alphabetically comes from the patient profile when <ret> is entered at the
 'Drug' prompt, but even if that drug/item is a supply, these order checks
 still need to occur, because profile drugs are checked against other
 profile drugs in the CK Hidden Action.

  Installation Instructions:
  --------------------------
  These patches should be installed when the Outpatient Pharmacy and 
  Inpatient Medications applications are not in use, and CPRS (Computerized
  Patient Record System) usage is at a minimum, particululary medication

     a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will
         NOT backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option
         will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
         the patch is installed.  It compares all components of the
         patch (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
         in the transport global.
     d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
         the components of the KIDS build.
