Subject: CMOP REJECTION CAUSES ERRANT NOT DISPENSED MESSAGE

 When entering a duplicate prescription, if the original prescription was
 sent to CMOP, rejected and filled locally, then the discontinue message
 will report that the original prescription was not filled.
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. INC5520639 - When entering a duplicate prescription, if the original
 prescription was sent to CMOP, rejected and filled locally, then the
 discontinue message will report that the original prescription was not
 filled.
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The CMOP portion of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) reports that the
 prescription was not filled. However, it was filled locally. The software
 does not currently check for that situation.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine PSODDPRE was modified to check for local release if a prescription
 was rejected by CMOP. It will display the message "Dispensed locally NOT
 by CMOP".
  
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 Heartland East HCS

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 -------------------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed-up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSO*7.0*568 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSO*7.0*568 in
 the patch list section on line 2.
