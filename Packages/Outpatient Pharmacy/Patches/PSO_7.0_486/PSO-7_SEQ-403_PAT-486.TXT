Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses three (3) issues:
  
 1. R10380204FY16 - when entering a new Rx using the Patient Prescription 
    Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS], and then editing the dosage and 
    entering an up caret (^) to exit, the Rx will be deleted as user
    accepts the Rx.
  
 2. R9361753FY16 - Using the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR
    ORDERS] option, when users edit/modify the Issue Date or Fill Date of an
    Outpatient Rx, the Rx Expiration Date is reset to an incorrect date.
  
 3. R15046343FY17 - A drug with same tab strength did NOT discontinue after
    duplicate (new order) processing. This created a duplicate active order in
    the patient's profile.

 Ticket Overview:
 ===============
 1. R10380204FY16- When entering a new RX using LM BACKDOOR ORDERS, the RX
    is Deleted on editing the dosage and entering an up caret (^) to exit.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When user enters a new Outpatient prescription and answers "NO" to the prompt
 "Is this correct? YES//" and then user edits the dosage and enter an up caret 
 (^) to exit the prompt "Dosage:" and accepts Rx then new Rx will be
 deleted. 
  
 Resolution:
 --------
 Correct routine code ASK^PSOORED5 to call line tag EXE instead EX to escape 
 killing required data before saving.
  
   
 2. R9361753FY16 - Outpatient Rx expired on an incorrect date, when Issue Date
    or Fill Date is modified.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When editing/modifying the Issue Date or Fill Date of an Outpatient Rx using
 the backdoor pharmacy, the Rx expiration date is reset to an incorrect Date.
   
 Resolution:
 --------
 Corrected A^PSOEXDT to set up expiration date for prescription without
 refills not less than 30 days after issue date unless it is a Clozapine
 prescription. In addition, if the newly calculated Rx Expiration Date is
 earlier than the Rx Fill Date the Rx Expiration Date will be re-calculated
 to be the Rx Fill Date plus the Days Supply value.
  
   
 3. R15046343FY17 - A drug with same tab strength did NOT discontinue after
    duplicate (new order) processing. This created a duplicate active order
    in patient's profile.
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 When using the options Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR
 ORDERS] or Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] for finishing 
 pending orders there was a scenario where duplicate orders could remain
 on the patient profile as ACTIVE. When finishing the pending order in
 some instances the prompt "Press return to continue:" would be presented.
 If the user entered an up caret (^) at this prompt, the duplicate existing
 order would not be discontinued after the new order was accepted.
    
 Resolution:
 --------
 Changed PSOORNEW routine to initialize the array variable PSORX("DFLG") 
 right before the call to file the new order and subsequent DC of the existing
 duplicate order. This initialization will cause the code responsible for 
 discontinuing the existing order (DCORD^PSONEW2) to perform the DCing of the
 existing order without skipping it, like it was doing before this fix.
