Description:
============

 ************************************************************************
 * This patch is being released with a KNOWN DEFECT.  Please refer to   *
 * item 7 in the list of enhancements below for a detailed explanation. *
 ************************************************************************
  
 This patch has enhancements that extend the capabilities of the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic 
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the
 applications involved in this project along with their patch numbers:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                       PSO*7*482
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0     BPS*1*23
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                        IB*2*591
  
 All three of these patches are being released via Kernel Installation
 and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build distribution.
  
 KIDS multi-build name: BPS IB PSO BUNDLE 11.0
   KIDS Host File name: BPS_1_23_IB_PSO.KID
  
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
   1. The View Prescription screen has been updated to display, in the
      'ECME Log' section, any 'Reject' comments entered by the user on
      the Reject Information Screen.
  
   2. The functionality which determines if a prescription is CMOP,
      Window, or Mail has been updated to disregard, for ePharmacy
      purposes, any value other than 'C', 'M', and 'W'.
  
   3. New functionality was added to improve overall efficiency 
      of the ePharmacy process by allowing the user to enter patient
      billing comments to appear on the Reject Information and
      Reject Notification Screens.
  
   4. The IGNORE THRESHOLD field was added to the PSO ePharmacy Site
      Parameters.  Sites have an option to set a dollar value for the
      field.  When the gross amount due for claims exceeds the set
      amount, rejects are prevented from being Ignored by
      users that do not hold the PSO ePharmacy Site Manager key.
  
   5. The prescription label functionality is being updated to add an 
      entry to the ECME Developers Log containing the claim status, 
      menu option, action (if available), and any open rejects. 
      Updates are being made to the following outpatient pharmacy menu 
      options and actions on the Medication Profile and Reject 
      Worklists:  ED Edit, PP Pull Rx (OP), RES Resubmit Claim, 
      OVR Submit Override Codes, CLA Submit Clarif.Code, ED Edit Rx, 
      PA Submit Prior Auth. SMA Submit Multi. Actions.  Updates are 
      also being made to the following stand-alone options: EDIT 
      PRESCRIPTIONS [PSO RXEDIT] and PULL EARLY FROM SUSPENSE [PSO PNDRX].
  
   6. The printing of labels is being updated to not allow a label to be
      printed for TRICARE or CHAMPVA patients if a reject is returned
      resulting in 'Insurer Asleep'.
   
   7. The prescription label functionality is being updated to resolve 
      label printing deficiencies.  Currently, there are several places
      in the systems which permit the user to print a label when printing
      of a label should not be allowed.  This patch adds checks necessary
      to prevent the printing of a label for most of those scenarios.
      Updates are being made to Edit Rx and the following actions on
      Medication Profile and Reject Worklists:  ED (Edit), RES (Resubmit),
      OVR (Submit Override Codes), CLA (Submit Clarification Code), PA
      (Submit Prior Authorization) and SMA (Submit Multiple Actions).
  
      *****************************************************************
      * This enhancement was unsuccessful in addressing all known     *
      * scenarios in which the system erroneously allows the user to  *
      * print a label.  This defect was identified in the course of   *
      * IOC testing.  The scenario not successfully addressed by this *
      * enhancement is rare, and when it does occur, the significance *
      * is minor.  All processing completes correctly and the system  *
      * continues to function as it did before this enhancement.  The *
      * IOC sites all concurred that this defect should not delay the *
      * release of this multi-build, and the product owner represen-  *
      * tative agreed that this situation could be corrected in a     *
      * future development effort.
      *****************************************************************
  
   8. The system is being updated to allow for the new HIPAA regulatory
      requirements that increase the length of the following fields: Name
      of Insured, Group Number, Group Name and Subscriber ID.
  
   9. The ePharmacy Medication Profile is being added as an action to VER
      View ePharmacy Rx.
