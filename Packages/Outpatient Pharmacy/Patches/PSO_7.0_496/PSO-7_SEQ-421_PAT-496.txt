 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1. I10127879FY16 - It is possible to suspend a script past the expiration
                    date.  
 Problem:
 --------
 Currently in Outpatient Pharmacy the users are able to enter a REFILL DATE 
 that is past the Rx EXPIRATION DATE. The software should not allow a refill
 date that is past the expiration date because it is an invalid date and the
 prescription will be expired before it can be dispensed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Data Dictionary for the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) was modified to include 
 restrictions on the following fields: FILL DATE (#22) and REFILL DATE (#.01)
 in the REFILL sub-file (#52.1). The restrictions will require that the value
 entered for either one of these two fields cannot be before the Rx ISSUE
 DATE or after the Rx EXPIRATION DATE.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Created new INPUT TRANSFORM code (FLDTINTR^PSOUTLA(Fill_Type)) and new 
 EXECUTABLE HELP code (FLDTHELP^PSOUTLA(Fill_Type)) and modified the fields
 mentioned above to replace the current M code with calls to these two new
 entry points in the PSOUTLA routine.

 2. I16514233FY17 - Vista transmits two instances of the same prescription
                    to the external interface. 
    R14795402FY17(d) - Vista is sending over prescription data twice for SOME
                       prescriptions, resulting in duplicates showing up in
                       ScriptPro
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 There is at least one scenario in Outpatient Pharmacy that will cause a 
 prescription fill to be sent twice to the external interface. This happens
 because sometimes when the user pulls a CMOP prescription from suspense to 
 print locally it will be sent to the print queue twice and consequently it
 was also being sent to the external interface twice.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Added a check in the routine that handles the pull from suspense to prevent
 it from adding a prescription to the print queue if the prescription is
 already on the queue.
   
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modified the routine PSOSUPOE to prevent it from setting the variable PPL
 with the same prescription twice.
  
  
 3. I11517650FY17 - Need assistance with SPMP Patient Address errors    
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 The State Prescription Monitoring Program (SPMP) module did not retrieve the
 correct State/Province (SPMP field PAT15 - State Address) and Postal Code 
 (SPMP field PAT16 - ZIP Code Address) for patients that have a foreign
 address on file. The software was retrieving the US state and Zip Code 
 fields, which were both blank for such patients. In addition, the Federal
 Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code for Canada is "CA", however the
 SPMP standard requires "CN" for Canada. 
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changed the retrieval of the patient's state and postal code fields to
 first check for the country. For foreign countries (non-US) it will
 retrieve the Province and Postal Codes values returned in the VAPA(23)
 and VAPA(24) return array from the ADD^VADPT API. Also changed it to send
 "CN" for PAT22 (Country of Non-US Resident) for Canada.
    
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modified the routines PSOASAP and PSOASAP0 to check whether the country is
 non-US (foreign). If so, it will use the value in VAPA(24) and VAPA(23) for
 the fields PAT15 and PAT16 respectively. Also, changed the line tag PAT22 
 on the PSOASAP0 routine to return "CN" instead of "CA" for Canada.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------- 
 The Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) users should not be running the AMIS
 Report while this patch is being installed. It should take less than 2
 minutes to install this patch.
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
    2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
       Installation menu.  From this menu, you may select to use the
       following options: 
       when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the patch # PSO*7.0*496:
  
         a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch 
            routines, DDs, templates, etc.
  
         c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
  
    4. From the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
       choose the patch to install.
  
    5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', respond NO.
  
    6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
    7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
 7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;DECEMBER 1997
    
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run 
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
   
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of 
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSO*7.0*496 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSO*7.0*496 in
 the patch list section on line 2.
