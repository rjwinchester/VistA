Description:

              FROM TITRATION TO A MAINTENANCE PRESCRIPTION
  
   
       
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 INC2950399 - Z-STACK ERROR WHEN CONVERTING AN OUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTION 
              FROM TITRATION TO A MAINTENANCE PRESCRIPTION
  
           
 Problem: 
 --------
 It was reported that when a dispense drug has a Maximum Dose Per Day
 value, and a prescription using this drug is converted from Titration to 
 maintenance using the "TR-Convert Titration Rx" action while using the 
 Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, and the 
 conversion results in a change to the number of refills, then this causes 
 a hard code error (<UNDEFINED>REFILL+36^PSODIR1 *PSODIR("# OF REFILLS"))
        
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch resolves the undefined error and software will prompt the user 
 with the correct number of refills.
  
  
   
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed routine PSODIR1 at REFILL+36 label to prevent the error and 
 default to PSOX variable if others are not defined.
  
  
 S DIR("B")=$S($G(COPY)&('$G(PSOTITRX)):$G(PSODIR("# OF

 REFILLS"))]"":PSODIR("# OF REFILLS"),$G(RFTT)>PSOX:RFTT,1:PSOX)

    options.  When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch #  
    (ex. PSO*7.0*543):
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not backup any
       other changes, such as DDs or templates.
    
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
       is installed. It compares all components of this patch:  routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
       
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you

 Post Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 None.
  
   
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
  ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997
   
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
