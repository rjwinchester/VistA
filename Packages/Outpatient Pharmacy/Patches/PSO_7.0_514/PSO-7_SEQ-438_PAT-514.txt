Subject: VERIFICATION SCREEN/QTY RECALCULATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues.
  
 1. I9914421FY16 - all prescription information is not displayed on the
                   Pharmacy verification screen
 2. R18151128FY18 - QTY Recalculation when Drug Changed
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. I9914421FY16 - all prescription information is not displayed on the
                   Pharmacy verification screen
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 There's a problem with the final screen seen when verifying a
 prescription, scrolling back is required to get a final look at
 prescription data. 
 This may be occurring when a patient has several Service Connected (SC)
 conditions, though there seems to still be plenty of room to allow the
 view of all prescription data.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The fix will be to add a 'Press Return to Continue' after displaying the
 prescription information for verification if there is not enough room on
 the screen to display all of the information.  The drug name will also be
 added at the top of the screen where the remainder of the disabilities
 are displayed.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routines PSOMLLD2, PSORN52, PSORENW3,PSOCPB
  
  
 2. R18151128FY18 - QTY Recalculation when Drug Changed
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Phoenix VAMC reported they have some of their bulk and Unit Dose drug
 entries marked for both Outpatient (OP) and Inpatient(IP) packages to
 allow the finishing pharmacist to change between the 2 items of the same
 strength and be able to either take from the inpatient vault or the
 outpatient vault (different physical locations). This used to not be a
 problem and they were able to finish a pending order exactly as entered by
 the provider.
  
 After the installation of patch PSO*7.0*422, when the finishing pharmacist
 changes the dispense drug, they are now forced to review the instructions
 and at the end the quantity sometimes recalculates to a different amount
 than was entered by the provider.  This happens when the ordered quantity
 is less than or more than what is defined by the entered SIG. This can
 create the opportunity to dispense the wrong quantity.
   
 Solution:
 ---------
 Changed the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] and
 Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] options to no longer re-calculate
 the Quantity when the Dispense Drug is edited for Controlled Substance 
 (CS) single dose pending orders or active prescriptions if they are marked
 "PRN" (as needed). Instead, the following message will be displayed:
   
           The QTY (999) has not been changed.  
           Please, review and update it if necessary.  
    
 Technical Solution:
 -------------------
 Changed line tag QTY in the PSOSIG routine to prevent re-calculation of Quantity
  for CS pending orders marked PRN when the Dispense Drug is edited.

 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
  
 Users should not be processing prescriptions while the patch is being 
 installed.  It should take less than 2 minutes to install this patch.
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
    2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  From this menu, you may select to use the
       following options: 
       when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the patch # PSO*7.0*514:
  
         a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch 
            routines, DDs, templates, etc.
  
         c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
  
    4. From the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
       choose the patch to install.
  
    5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//'
       respond NO.
  
    6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//' respond NO.
  
    7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation
 of the development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision
 between the development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should
 have saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the
 Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at
 time of install). The message containing the backed up routines can
 be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action
 prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used
 to install the backed up routines onto the VistA System. 
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
