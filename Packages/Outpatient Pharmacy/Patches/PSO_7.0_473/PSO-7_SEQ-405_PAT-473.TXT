 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  1. I8924763FY16 - When a Maintenance Rx was created as the result of
     converting a Titration marked Rx instead of retaining the Expiration Date
     from the Titration Rx it was wrongly being assigned a new Expiration
     Date.
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When using the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
  option and using the hidden action Convert Titration Rx (TR) to create a
  new Maintenance dose prescription from a Titration Rx the user noticed
  that the Expiration Date associated with the new Maintenance Rx was
  calculated 366 days in the future instead of being assigned the exact 
  same Expiration Data from the Titration Rx.
   
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Changed the routine PSON52 responsible for creating the new Maintenance Rx
  to overwrite the calculated Expiration Date with the Expiration Date from
  the original Titration Rx.
  
  ROUTINE:
  --------
  Added code at DT+1^PSON52 to set the array variable PSOX("STOP DATE") with 
  the Titration Rx Expiration, if a Titration Rx To Maintenance Rx conversion
  is taking place.
  
  
  2. I9667491FY16 -The site would like to use the Barcode Batch 
     Prescription Entry [PSO BATCH BARCODE] option to renew prescriptions.
     When this is attempted the renewal appears to succeed and there is a
     prompt to edit the renewal. If yes is selected the session will crash
     with an undefined variable (hard error).
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When using the Barcode Batch Prescription Entry [PSO BATCH BARCODE] option
  for renewals the users received a hard error and were logged out of the
  system when they answered YES to the "Edit renewed Rx ?" prompt (before
  accepting it).
   
  Resolution:
  -----------
  The root cause of this problem was due to the fact that the PSOACT variable
  that controls which action a specific user can perform on an order, based on
  the user security keys as well as whether the order was digitally signed or
  not. The routine PSOBBC was modified to initialize the PSOACT variable
  which will prevent the hard error.
   
  ROUTINE:
  --------
  Added code at NEW+9^PSOBBC to initialize the PSOACT variable according to 
  the type of order, user's security keys and system parameters.
  
  
  3. R8247671FY16 - We would like to request for assistance in the
     identification and deployment of the VistA patch used at VHA station
     #663 (Seattle division) that enables pharmacy staff resolves the Fill
     Date issue and generates the error message described below.
  
     "The earliest fill date allowed is determined by the Issue Date, the
     Fill Date cannot be before the Issue Date or past the Expiration
     Date. Both the month and day are required."
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When using the speed renewal hidden action in Patient Prescription 
  Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option, it was reported that when the
  # of refills is zero, there are times the expiration date is set to a
  date earlier than the filled date.
   
  Resolution:
  -----------
  In a situation where the # of refill is zero, patient is not a clozapine 
  patient and the expiration date is < fill date, added new logic to 
  calculate the most appropriate expiration date.
  
  
  ROUTINE:
  --------
  Added new code to DT+1^PSON52 to check if the patient is not a clozapine 
  patient, # of Refills is zero and the Expiration Date is < Filled Date,
  then to set the expiration date.
  The Expiration Date will normally be set to (Fill Date + Day Supply). 
  However, it will be adjusted to comply with the following restrictions:
   - For controlled substances, the maximum Expiration Date allowable is 
     (Issue Date + 184 days)
   - For non-controlled substances, the maximum Expiration Date allowable 
     is (Issue Date + 366 days)
   - If the Expiration Date is less than the Fill Date, it will be set to 
     the same as the Fill Date
