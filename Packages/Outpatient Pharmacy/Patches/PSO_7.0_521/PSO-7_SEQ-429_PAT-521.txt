Subject: FDA MEDICATION GUIDES AUTOMATIC PRINTING JAVA COMPONENT UPGRADE

Category: 
  - Informational
  - Other

Description:
============

 FDA Medication Guides Automatic Printing Java software allows pharmacists 
 to automatically print FDA Medication Guides for a specific medication 
 when one is available and a prescription is being filled. This software 
 must be installed on a Windows print server for the functionality to work 
 correctly. 
  
 This patch is to upgrade the FDA Medication Guides Automatic Printing 
 Java component to support Acrobat Reader DC version 18. Windows
 registry keys for Acrobat Reader DC 18 have been added to
 NetworkServiceTaskSetting.reg file. 
  
 The Acrobat Reader DC version 18 installation is available at
 \\vha.domain.ext\cs\Production\Software Packages\Adobe\Acrobat Reader 
 DC
  
 If your site is currently utilizing the FDA Med Guide Auto Printing 
 software, this release provides the necessary Network Registry settings 
 to allow the software to work with Adobe Acrobat Reader DC 18. Please
 refer to the "FDA Medication Guides Project Java Component (Automatic
 Printing) Installation Guide" for detailed instructions on retrieving and
 installing the necessary software.
  
 ******If your site does not utilize the FDA Med Guide Auto Printing 
 software, no further action on PSO*7*521 is necessary.******
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 R18810467FY18 - FDA Med Guides in Outpatient Pharmacy stopped printing 
 when the print server was auto upgraded to Adobe Reader DC 18.
 I18898754FY18 (d)
 R18859958FY18 (d)
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Automatic printing of FDA Med Guides was originally developed for use 
 with Acrobat Reader 11.0. As Acrobat Reader DC 18 is the latest approved 
 version in VA, Acrobat Reader DC 18 automatic updates are being pushed out
 to the Windows servers by SCCM. This breaks the FDA Med Guides Automatic
 Printing Java component.
  
 This patch is to upgrade the FDA Medication Guides Automatic Printing 
 Java component to support Acrobat Reader DC 18.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 No code changes were made for this upgrade. The scripts were changed to 
 add Windows registry keys for Adobe Acrobat Reader DC 18.
