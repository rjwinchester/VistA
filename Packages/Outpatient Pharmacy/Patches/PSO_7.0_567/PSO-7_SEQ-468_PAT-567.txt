 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC6192407 - Wrong ERX LOOK-BACK DAYS with patch PSO*7*551
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 When using the Complete Orders from eRx [PSO ERX FINISH] option, the
 ERX DEFAULT LOOKBACK DAYS field (#10.2) of the OUTPATIENT SITE file
 (#59) displayed with the current date when the field is not populated.
 If the field #10.2 is blank, the display on screen header for this field
 should go back 365 days instead of current date.
  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch fixes the issue by displaying the populated value of 
 the ERX DEFAULT LOOKBACK DAYS field (#10.2). Otherwise, the printout 
 will go back to 365.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changes were made to HDR^PSOERX and HDR^PSOERXC1 routines to print the
 correct value in the header line.
  
  
   
 2. INC6192115 - Selection prompt of (1-1) with patch PSO*7*551
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 When using the Complete Orders from eRx [PSO ERX FINISH] option with 
 the following conditions:
  - No records found
  - Selecting the 'SP-SELECT PATIENT' action
 The software prompts the user with "Enter a number (1-1):" even though
 there is no data to select from.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch fixes the issue by prompting the "Enter a number (1-1):" only 
 if records are available to select from.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Change was made to PATDATA^PSOERXC1 routine to not allow selection 
 prompt if no entries are found.

 Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------ 
 This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 2 minutes
 to install.
   
    
  1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
   
  2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
    
  3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
     Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following
     options.  When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch #  
     (ex. PSO*7.0*567):
   
     a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not
        backup any other changes, such as DDs or templates.
     
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
        is installed. It compares all components of this patch:  routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
        
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
    
  4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
   
  5. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?

  6. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
   
  7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
   
   
 Post Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 None.
    
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines 
 of the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
   ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997
    
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation
 of development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision
 between development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should
 have saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the
 Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at
 time of install). The message containing the backed up routines can
 be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action
 prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used
 to install the backed up routines onto the VistA System. 
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 Validation of Back-out Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Back-out Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2
 lines of the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option
 First Line Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines
 contained in the PSO*7.0*567 patch have been rolled back, the first
 two lines of the Routines will no longer contain the designation
 of patch PSO*7.0*567 in the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997;Build 5

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.

Routine Name: PSOERX
