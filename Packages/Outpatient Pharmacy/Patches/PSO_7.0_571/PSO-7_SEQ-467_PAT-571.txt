Subject: Pharmacy National Clozapine Coordination (NCC) Follow Up

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to prevent a patient safety issue by 
 correcting a possible historical data error in the PHARMACY PATIENT file 
 (#55) that can prevent clozapine patients from receiving their clozapine 
 prescriptions.  The patients who have this data error may need to have 
 their clozapine status changed.  Patients should NOT be edited until the 
 NCC staff provide an update to the site.
    
 A report will be made that shows those patients with a clozapine treatment
 status of "PRE-TREATMENT" and can be sent to the National Clozapine
 Coordinating Center (NCCC).  This patch is a follow up to the Mental
 Health NCCC multi-build which contained the patches YS*5.01*122,
 PSO*7.0*457, PSJ*5.0*327, and OR*3.0*427.  The multi-build was released
 nationally on July 15, 2019 with a compliance date of August 14, 2019.
  
 Patients who have a status of PRE-TREATMENT will not be able to get their 
 clozapine prescriptions.  
  
 This will require a user that has FileMan experience and access to file 
 #55.  A FileMan search will be performed on a cross-referenced field 
 so the results will be returned quickly.  It is anticipated that it will 
 take less than 20 minutes to generate the report.  If patients are found 
 with a pre-treatment status the report should also be sent in an Outlook 
 message as described below.
  
 The FileMan search will find those patients who have a CLOZAPINE STATUS 
 (field #54) of PRE-TREATMENT.  These patients need to be identified as 
 soon as possible so that their clozapine status can be edited, if 
 needed.  It is possible that the search will not find any patients with a 
 PRE-TREATMENT status.  The report will include the DATE OF DEATH field 
 (#.351) from the PATIENT file (#2).  It is likely that the DATE OF DEATH 
 field will be blank for most, if not all, patients on the report (if any 
 pre-treatment patients are found).
   
 The MailMan message should be sent to yourself and the PSOCLOZ Mail 
 Group.  It is advised that this patch description be made available to 
 the recipients of the MailMan message described below to avoid any 
 confusion as to why they received the email.  The patch description 
 message can be forwarded to the PSOCLOZ mail group, or any other 
 concerned users.
  
 Since the report is sent as a MailMan message you will be able to forward 
 it, if needed.  The email message will contain personally identifiable 
 information (PII) and should be handled following all VA security rules 
 and guidelines.
  
 If the site staff have any questions about registering active clozapine 
 patients they should contact the NCCC for guidance.
  
 If patients are found with a PRE-TREATMENT status then send the report as
 an encrypted Outlook message to the VHA CLOZAPINE national mail group.  If
 the message is sent the subject should be the site name, site number, and
 the term PRE-TREATMENT.  For example: "San Diego 664 PRE-TREATMENT".
  
 *** Instructions on how to Search the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) ***
  
 Note: The results of the search will be stored in a SORT TEMPLATE named 
 PSO CLOZAPINE PRE-TREATMENT.  When entering the description of the 
 template it may be useful to put the date into the text.  An example is 
 shown below.  A print template named PSO CLOZAPINE STATUS is created.  
 This print template can be used to list any pharmacy patients that need 
 to be checked.

 Note: If no patients are found with a PRE-TREATMENT status then no 
 further action is needed.  The clinical staff need to be consulted as to 
 which patients should have their status changed to ACTIVE.
  
 To change this status a privileged user can use FileMan to edit the 
 PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) and change the value in the CLOZAPINE STATUS 
 field (#54) to "ACTIVE" for specific patients.
