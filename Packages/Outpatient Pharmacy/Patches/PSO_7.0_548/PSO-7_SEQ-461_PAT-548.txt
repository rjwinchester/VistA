Subject: EXPIRATION DATE INCORRECT ON NON-CONTROLLED RX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Description:

 non-controlled drugs are finished with the expiration date of the 
 controlled drug.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. INC2138569 - Non-controlled rx - expiration calculated incorrectly
  
 Problem:
 -------
 A non-controlled rx for 90-day supply with 3 refills expires after 6 
 months. It should be one year.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The problem results from finishing the non-controlled rx immediately 
 after finishing a renewed controlled rx. The DEA("CS") variable is not 
 cleaned up after the renewal finish process, resulting in the 
 non-controlled rx being incorrectly identified as controlled. I made a 
 change to PSORENW1 to kill the variable after it is used.

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 -------------------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed-up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.

 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSO routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSO*7.0*548 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSO*7.0*548 in
 the patch list section on line 2.
