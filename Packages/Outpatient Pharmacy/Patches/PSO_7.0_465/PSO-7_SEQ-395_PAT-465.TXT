 1. I8485105FY16 - CMOP transmission stopped during the night
  
 Patient Safety Issue:
 --------------------
 PSPO 2979
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The controlled substance prescription CMOP (Consolidated Mail Outpatient
 Pharmacy) transmission went through all right but the process errored out
 on the non-controlled substance prescription with the following message:
  
 Subj: CMOP Error WACO 93447 [#24160246] 04/21/16@03:17 6 lines
 From: Users Name - IT SPECIALIST (VISTA SUPPORT) In 'IN' basket.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 NON-CS CMOP Transmission encountered the following error. Please 
 investigate
 Division: WACO
 Type/Batch NON-CS / 93447
 Error: <UNDEFINED>DG1+15^PSOHLSN2 *PSOARRY(1)
 The prescriptions have been reset and other divisions' transmissions are 
 continuing.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine PSOHLSN2 to Quit at the beginning of tag DG1 so the ICD 
 checks are not performed.  Also add a comment above this Quit to note 
 that if these checks are needed in the future, the code will need to be
 re-evaluated for any necessary changes.
  
  
 2. I9916149FY16 - ScriptPro issue with temporary address on label
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Technical Manual/Security Guide is not up to date with the way
 the patient's addresses (Confidential and Temporary) are sent in the
 HL7 record.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Update the Technical Manual/Security Guide to correctly show where the
 patient's Confidential and Temporary addresses will be located in the
 HL7 record.
