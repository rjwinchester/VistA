Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 MPDU - MEDICATION PERMISSIONS/DISPENSING UPDATES - Build 3
  
 This patch will address the following issues:

     piece corresponding to RX PATIENT STATUS on the "PS" node.
 2.  Display in the Patient's Medication Profile has a leading zero 
     in the quantity if it is a fractional quantity.
 3.  An intermittent issue was found that some Non-Controlled Substance 
     order items are not able to be marked for titrate.
 4.  While testing the Outpatient Medication Controlled substance order 
     edit, unnecessary code was found.
 5.  Manilla Philippines unique address is stopping controlled substance
     orders from finishing.
 6.  Undefined Error at ACP+21^PSOORNEW
 7.  Patient address, risk of carryover information between patients in 
     VAPA array.
 8.  Allowing "# of refills" entry to be edited on Controlled Substance
     orders.

  Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview: 
  --------------------------------------------
  
  1. R11837840FY17
  
  Problem:
  =======
  A site reported bad data in the "PS" node of the Pharmacy Patient
  file (#55). The node should only contain one numeric status, but some
  records had multiple delimiters/statuses. The data has been corrected
  at the site. However, there may be other sites with the same issue,
  therefore, a post-install routine is transported in this patch to
  address this issue.
  
  Resolution:
  ==========
  A post-install routine, PSO7P517 will loop through the PHARMACY PATIENT
  file (#55) and will check if the ^PS(55,DFN,"PS") node contains "^", then
  it will reset the node to the first numeric piece. A mail message will
  be generated to the PSORPH KEY holders with the old and new value and a
  second mail message to the installer to indicate the patch was completed.
  
  This post-install routine PSO7P517 may be deleted manually from your
  system after the post-install mail messages are received.
  
  
  2. 816346   A leading zero before the whole number first integer."02.5"
              QTY displays
  
  Problem:
  ========
  A leading zero is inappropriately being added to fractional quantity 
  prescriptions when the number before the decimal is greater than zero
  
  Resolution:
  ===========
  Routine PSON52 was modified prevent the addition of the leading zero if 
  the number before the decimal is greater than zero (i.e. 4.5).
  
  
  3. INC1977447,810757 - Bug in new Titration dosage  Controlled drug 
                         check
  
  Problem:
  ========
  An issue was reported that some Titration Order's for Non-Controlled 
  Substance Drug are being blocked as if it is a controlled substance drug.
  
  Resolution:
  ===========
  Routine PSOOTMRX was modified to remove this intermittent issue. 
  
  
  4. Outpatient Medication Editing a range for a Controlled Substance Order
  
  Problem:
  ========
  An HPS developer found that a loop was not needed given the existing 
  code.
  
  Resolution:
  =============
  Routine PSOOREDT was modified to follow the format of a similar call 
  which makes proper use of the loop.
  
  
  5.  815634 - Manila Philippines unique issue of patient zip code 
               population
  
  Problem:
  =========
  An issue was reported that if a patient had a Philippines address, the 
  system is not allowing a Controlled Substance order to be finished.
  
  Resolution:
  ==========
  Routine PSODRG has been modified to use the new API that checks the 
  validity of the patient zip code. If the zip code is not valid, the user 
  will be informed that controlled substance prescriptions require a 
  patient address. The user will not be allowed to write the controlled 
  substance order until the patient has a valid address. Since some 
  foreign countries don't have zip codes, routine PSOORNEW was modified to 
  consider the country when evaluating the zip code validity.
  
  
  6.  816327 - New error ACP+21^PSOORNEW <undef>
  
  Problem:
  =========
  An undefined error occurred when trying to finish a Controlled 
  Substance order.
  
  Resolution:
  ===========
  Routine PSOORNEW was modified to move the PSODRUG("IEN") check. The 
  check now occurs after drug selection to ensure a drug has been selected.
  
  
  7.  816996 - Patient address risk of carryover between patients in VAPA 
               array
  
  Problem:
  ========
  There is a risk in the Order Finishing functionality where the patient 
  address variable could carryover between patients.
  
  Resolution:
  ===========
  Routine POOORNEW was modified to create a new function that 'New's the 
  VAPA array before making the VADPT call, protecting the stack and 
  ensuring carryover does not occur.
  
  
  8. 814219 - Controlled substances # of refills edit issue
  
  Problem:
  ========
  When selecting the # of refills field as the only edit on a pending
  prescription, the following message is given in VISTA:
  The selection includes field(s) that are not editable
  for controlled substances. These field(s) will be skipped.
  
  This was previous functionality and the change wasn't specifically 
  mentioned in the patch description that delivered this change 
  (PSO*7*505).
  
  Resolution:
  ==========
  Modified PSOOREDT to allow refills to be edited, restoring the ability 
  for a user to edit the number of refills for a controlled substance
  medication (schedule 3-5).

  Pre-Installation Instructions:
  =============================
  N/A
  
  
  Installation Instructions:
  -------------------------- 
  
  Pharmacy users can be on the system, but it is recommended that this 
  patch be queued to run after normal business hours.
  The cleanup of the "PS" node of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) might 
  take up to an hour depending on the number of records in the file. 
  
  
  1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
   
  2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
   
  3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
     Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may select to use the
     following options.
     
     When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch # (PSO*7.0*517):
  
     a. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this 
        patch is installed. It compares all components of this patch
        (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
  
     b. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
        transport global.
  
  4. Select the installation option Backup a Transport Global. This
     option will create a backup message of any routines exported with 
     this patch in case you need to back out this patch. It will not backup
     any other changes such as Data Dictionaries (DD's) or templates. It 
     is important this step be followed, because if back out of this patch 
     is necessary, having the backup will make the process much easier.
  
  5. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s)
     option and choose the patch to install.
  
  6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//' Respond NO

     and Protocols? NO//' Respond NO
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 The post-install routine PSO7P517 may be deleted manually from your system
 after the post-install mail messages are received by using the following
 option:
  
     Select Routine Tools <TEST ACCOUNT> Option: Delete Routines
  
     ROUTINE DELETE
  
     All Routines? No => No
  
     Routine: PSO7P517
  
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
  
 Back-out Procedures are only needed if there are major problems (examples 
 include the KIDS notice of incompletion or hard errors) resulting from the
 installation of this patch. You must have concurrence from Health Product
 Support before a rollback can occur. Enter a ServiceNow helpdesk ticket 
 to obtain this concurrence.
  
 Prior to installing a patch, the site/region should have saved a backup 
 of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport Global 
 [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install). The message 
 containing the backed-up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan"
 function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function 
 "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed-up routines 
 onto the VistA System.
   
   
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
  
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the 
 PSO*7.0*517 patch has been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSO*7.0*517 in 
 the patch list section on line 2.
