 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1.       I18715588FY18 - Undefined error when ^ out of prompt
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 When doing a refill or a partial for a remote prescription, the user
 will get an Undefined error if they enter an ^ at the prompt 'Select
 matching local drug'.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine PSORRX1 so processing will return to the Medication Profile
 if the user enters an ^ at the 'Select matching local drug' prompt.
  
 2.       INC0023405 - Set prompt default to NO instead of YES
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 The OneVA Pharmacy system is causing significant system latency to the
 point of response time-outs. PBM officially requests that the default
 value for the prompt asking "Would you like to query prescriptions from
 other OneVA Pharmacy locations?" be changed from YES to NO so that the
 amount of network traffic is reduced without necessarily having to turn
 the system off.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine PSORX1 so the default for the prompt 'Would you like to
 query prescriptions from other OneVA Pharmacy locations' is NO instead
 of YES.
  
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------

 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
  
 This patch should be installed during non-peak hours.
 It should take less than 2 minutes to install this patch.
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
    2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  From this menu, you may select to use the
       following options: 
       when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the patch # PSO*7.0*519:
  
         a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch 
            routines, DDs, templates, etc.
  
         c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
  
    4. From the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
       choose the patch to install.
  
    5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', respond NO.
  
    6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
    7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first
 2 lines of the routines contained in the patch. The second line
 will contain the patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;DEC 1997;Build 349 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] 
 can be run to compare the routine checksums to what is documented
 in the patch description.
  
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation
 of development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision
 between development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should
 have saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the
 Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at
 time of install). The message containing the backed up routines can
 be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action
 prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used
 to install the backed up routines onto the VistA System. 
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2
 lines of the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option
 First Line Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines
 contained in the PSO*7.0*519 patch have been rolled back, the first
 two lines of the Routines will no longer contain the designation
 of patch PSO*7.0*519 in the patch list section on line 2.
