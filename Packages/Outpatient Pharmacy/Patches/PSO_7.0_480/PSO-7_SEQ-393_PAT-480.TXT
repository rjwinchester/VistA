 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 A post install routine PSO480P will run after PSO*7*480 installs.  This 
 routine will run through the Outpatient Pharmacy file #52 by install date 
 of patch PSO*7*460, which introduced this problem, and check every fill 
 for a veteran to determine if they are on a domiciliary ward and were 
 charged a copay. If they were charged a copay, then a cancel charge will 
 be sent to the Integrated Billing package for this copay charge. Several 
 reports will be printed with information for each copay that was
 cancelled.
  
 The detailed report will contain the following information and will be 
 sent to the mailman message of the person installing the patch along with
 the developers of the patch as well as a couple of Pharmacy Benefits 
 Management team members:
   Release Date
   Patient DFN
   RX #
   Fill #
   IB Action Type
   Total AMT
   AR Bill #    
   Institution
  
 The delimited report will contain the same information as the detailed 
 report and will be separated by a carat '^' between data so it can be 
 pulled into an excel spreadsheet if so desired.  This report will be sent 
 to the same people as the detailed report.
  
 The summary report will be sent to the same group as the other two 
 reports as well as the billing group PRCA ADJUSTMENT TRANS. This report
 contains the following summary information:
    Total Amount of Prescriptions
    Total of Prescriptions that need Manual Intervention
    Total Number of Patients
    Total Dollars for Cancelled Copays
  
  
 After the post install runs, the Outpatient Pharmacy activity log will 
 post a comment as in the example below to indicate a copay reset has
 occurred:
