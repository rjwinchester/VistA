Subject: <SYNTAX>BLDACK+23 PSORWRAP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When utilizing OneVA to process a refill or partial for a renewed 
 prescription the Remote prescription label will not print. At the host 
 facility, a syntax error is generated within the PSORWRAP routine.
  
 <SYNTAX>BLDACK+23^PSORWRAP
  
 This is due to the renewed prescriptions containing an alpha numeric value
 at the end of the prescription number. The prescription number is used as
 a subscript in an XTMP global for processing purposes.
  
 This patch will modify routines PSORRPA1, PSORREF, and PSORWRAP to do the
 following:
  
 1.) Modify the XTMP global storage and references using RXNUM to now  use
     +RXNUM, forcing the value to be numeric.
  
 2.) Modify PSORWRAP to decouple the label prompt from the if statement 
     that checks for the 'host' site label data. These are not dependent on
     one another and that dependency will be removed.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:

 1. R11791420FY17 - OneVA Pharmacy Label Not Printing 
  
  
 Problem:
 -------
 <SYNTAX>BLDACK+23^PSORWRAP
 During the processing of a remote prescription, errors can occur in the 
 queued label printing process. This causes the host site label data from
 returning to the dispensing site. When this happens, the dispensing site
 is not provided a device prompt to print a label. The error is related to
 prescription numbers that have alpha numerics in them (specifically
 renewals).
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modifications to PSORRPA1 and PSORREF have been modified to remove any 
 alpha numeric values from the storage of a prescription number in the XTMP
 globals. The logic in these routines now uses +RXNUM to prevent the 
 storing of prescription number with the alpha numeric values.
  
 PSORWRAP has been modified to de-couple the laser label logic from the 
 storage of the host generated label. This will prevent the software from
 bypassing the label device prompt and printing logic at the dispensing
 site.
