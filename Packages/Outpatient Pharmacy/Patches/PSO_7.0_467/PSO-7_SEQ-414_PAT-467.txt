 **************************************************************************
                              ***Important***
  
 In order to manage the complex technical nature of implementing Inbound
 ePrescribing, patch PSO*7*467 will install the software in a dormant
 state. All VA medical centers will receive the patch simultaneously upon
 its national release, with an expectation that it will be installed within
 the standard 30-day compliance period. 
  
 When ready to start receiving Inbound eRXs, sites will need to enlist the 
 assistance of the Inbound eRX Support Team and follow the steps in the 
 Implementation Guide - Inbound ePrescribing (IEP) Version 2.0. which is 
 included in the Documentation Retrieval Instructions section of this 
 patch description and the Vista Documenation Library (vdl). Once training 
 and initial configuration steps are completed, sites should submit a help 
 desk ticket to the VA National Service Desk (NSD) at 855-NSD-HELP 
 (673-4357) and reference "Inbound eRx". 
  
 Implementation of Inbound ePrescribing by the eRX Support Team will be 
 delayed until the release of Emergency patch PSO*7*506 which is currently 
 under development and being tested.
 **************************************************************************
  
  
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Patient Care Services (PCS) and 
 Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) has requested a new capability as part
 of the Pharmacy Reengineering (PRE) program to receive inbound electronic
 prescriptions (e-prescriptions or eRxs) from an external provider (e.g., a
 doctor not associated with the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA],
 medical staff at a Department of Defense [DoD] military treatment 
 facility, etc.). Once received, these prescriptions will be moved into the
 existing Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) for processing and dispensing.
  
 A new list manager interface has been created that provides a list of 
 inbound electronic prescriptions. This list is commonly called the 'eRx
 Holding Queue'. Search and sort functionality allows a user to look for
 specific prescriptions if needed. Once a user selects a prescription, the
 interface allows the users to validate patient, provider, and drug 
 information. After the patient, provider, and drug have been validated,
 the user can then accept the electronic prescription. Once an eRx is
 accepted it is sent to the PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41). Users
 can then use the existing option Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE
 FINISH] to finish the prescription.
  
 Additional options are also available that allow users to place an 
 electronic prescription on hold, remove it from hold, reject, print,
 accept, and remove prescriptions.
  
 Enhancements have been made to the functionality that builds the existing
 medication profile displays in Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE 
 FINISH] and Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]. If a
 user selects a prescription that was initially accepted from inbound
 electronic Prescribing, Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] and
 Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] will now display
 information about the original electronic prescription, allowing the user
 to review and/or make final adjustments. A new hidden action has been
 created in both Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] and Patient
 Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]. The hidden action 
 Print eRx [PSO ERX OP PRINT] allows the user to print the original
 electronic prescription information to a hard copy for review.
  
 The inbound electronic prescribing patch consists of Data dictionaries, 
 routines, and Remote Procedure Calls (RPC's) that facilitate the receipt
 and processing of an incoming eRx. New RPC's allow the eRx Processing Hub
 to call into Vista to perform actions such as validating a provider or
 drug.
  
 The eRx Processing Hub works in conjunction with the VistA eRx Holding 
 Queue and associated procedures in multiple VistA OP instances. High-level
 functions of the eRx Processing Hub are:
  
 - Receive, persist, validate, manipulate, and construct/send National
   Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) Extended Markup 
   Language (XML) messages.
 - Validate designated pharmacy from NCPDP XML and match to VistA OP 
   instance.
 - Perform auto-validation and matching (including patient, 
   enrollment/registration, provider, drug).
 - Transform prescription data and send to VistA eRx Holding Queue format.
 - Maintain processing statuses and perform error/exception handling.
 - Provide administrative User Interface (UI) to track, enable/disable 
   transmission, validate eRx and run reports.
  
 A new option, Complete Orders from eRx [PSO ERX FINISH] is being added to
 the Rx (Prescriptions) [PSO RX] menu within the outpatient pharmacy
 package.
