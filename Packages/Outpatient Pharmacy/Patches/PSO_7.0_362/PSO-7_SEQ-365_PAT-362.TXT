Subject: BAD ADDR/COMBAT VET/SIG

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues:
  
 1) Fix the Bad Address Indicator Report (Bad Address Suspended List [PSO 
    BAI SUSPENDED]) so prescriptions with a Routing of Mail and the patient
    has a Country Code of Philippines will not show up on the report when
    run at Manila.
  
 2) A patient's prescription is changing from Co-pay to No Co-pay when it
    is released.
  
 3) The Sig does not match between the prescription and order.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1) INC000000410256 - Foreign Address shows on reports for Philippines
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 While researching issue for Philippines addresses getting marked as foreign 
 addresses (INC000000398402) it was discovered that the Bad Address Suspended
 List [PSO BAI SUSPENDED] and the Log of Suspended Rx's by Day [PSO PNDLOG]
 reports will also mark prescriptions as having a foreign address when the
 Routing is Mail and the patient has a country of Philippines.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Need to modify these reports so they check the patient's country against the 
 Site the user is processing from and if they are Philippines and Manila 
 respectively, the prescription should not show up on the report.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 =====================
 Modify FOREIGN^PSOSULOG and FOREIGN^PSOBAIR2 to check the Site against 
 the patient's country.  If the Country is Philippines and the Site is 
 Manila-RO then do not add the prescription to the report.
  
  
 2) INC000000604392 - Combat Vet Charges
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If a patient has a prescription that was created while he/she was combat
 vet eligible and the prescription is renewed after their combat vet
 eligibility ends, the new prescription is not combat vet eligible and the
 prescription requires a co-pay.  When releasing the new prescription, it
 is changing from co-pay to no co-pay.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify processing so the co-pay eligibilities do not carry over into the new
 prescription during a renewal.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routine PSORN52 so the IBQ node from the renewed prescription is
 not copied to the new prescription.
  
  
 3) INC000000717567 - RX Sig Does Not Match Order Text 
  
 Patient Safety Issue:
 ---------------------
 PSPO 2250
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If the Duration of a prescription is deleted, the existing order Sig is not 
 updated nor is a new order created so the Order and Prescription do not
 match.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify processing so a new order is created if the Duration is deleted.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routine PSOOREDX at tag DUR1 to set PSOSIGFL=1 if deleting Duration.
