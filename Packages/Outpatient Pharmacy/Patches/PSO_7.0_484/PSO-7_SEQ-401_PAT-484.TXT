Subject: Drug Interaction Order Checks

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issue:
  
 Drug Interaction Order Checks were wrong because an array used to store 
 data was overwriting the data from the local fill with data for the 
 remote fill.

 1. R13223578FY17 - Drug Interaction Order Checks
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The site tested the interaction with a VistA entered order and got the
 remote check and the local fill showed at the end as a local fill.  
 Shouldn't the local fill show up as the primary interaction?
  
 ***Critical*** Drug Interaction with Prospective Drug:                    
 KETOROLAC 30MG/ML INJ 1ML and  
 LOCATION: MARION VA MEDICAL CENTER  Remote Rx: xx36919
 Drug: IBUPROFEN 600MG TAB (HOLD)  SIG: TAKE ONE TABLET BY
 MOUTH EVERY 6 HOURS AS NEEDED FOR PAIN OR INFLAMMATION    
 Last Filled On: 10/06/16  
  
 *** THERAPEUTIC DUPLICATION(S) *** KETOROLAC 30MG/ML INJ 
 1ML with  
 Local Rx #xx43843 (ACTIVE) for IBUPROFEN 600MG TAB  
 Remote Rx #xx36919 (HOLD) for IBUPROFEN 600MG TAB
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The code was overwriting an array entry that was used to display the Drug
 Interaction checks.  The local medications were checked first and entered
 into the array by severity, then a code to signify clinic/local
 (outpatient)/remote/pending/other, then the VA generic drug name, then
 drug name.
  
 Ex: ZDGDG("C",2,"IBUPROFEN","IBUPROFEN 600MG TAB")="O;1399950;PROFILE;2^1"
         the 2 above is from this check:
         ON="O;1399950;PROFILE;2
      If first ; piece of ON
                 =C then use 1
                 =O then use 2
                 =R then use 3
                 =P then use 4
                 otherwise use 5
  
 When setting the remote meds into this array, it was hardsetting a 2
 instead of using the conditional checks the same as local meds.
 Ex: ZDGDG("C",2,"IBUPROFEN","IBUPROFEN 600MG TAB")="R;1;PROFILE;1^2"
  
 This caused the remote entry to overwrite the local entry previously set.
  
 The fix is to use the same conditional setting as the local check.  This
 will create two separate entries in the order check array and display
 both order checks to the user.
  
 ZDGDG("C",2,"IBUPROFEN","IBUPROFEN 600MG TAB")="O;1399950;PROFILE;2^1"
 ZDGDG("C",3,"IBUPROFEN","IBUPROFEN 600MG TAB")="R;1;PROFILE;1^2"
  
 Important Installation Note:
 ============================
 This patch is part of a multi-package build. There are two patches 
 associated with the fix - PSO*7.0*484 and OR*3.0*457. These patches are a 
 combined build utilizing 1 Host file.  Installing PSO*7.0*484 will also 
 install OR*3.0*457.
  
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ----------------------------------------------------
 Installation of the host file should be coordinated among the packages 
 affected since only one installation is necessary.
  
 The patches are:
  
      PSO*7.0*484
      OR*3.0*457
      
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directory at the following OI Field Offices:
  
 Albany: domain.ext
 Hines:  domain.ext  
 Salt Lake City: domain.ext
   
  
 File name                          Description             Format
