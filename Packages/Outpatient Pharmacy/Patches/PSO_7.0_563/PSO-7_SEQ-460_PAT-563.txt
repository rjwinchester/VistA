Subject: NON-VA PROVIDER APRIL 2019 UPDATES

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Note****
 Import of Non-Va providers is OPTIONAL and should be coordinated between 
 OIT and the site personnel (Pharmacy)
  
 This Informational patch is to notify sites that the non-VA providers 
 file(s) from the April 2019 master spreadsheet are available for download.
  
  
 Previous patch, PSO*7.0*481, provided functionality to import "new" 
 non-VA provider information into the NEW PERSON (#200) file. A "new"
 provider is defined as a provider whose National Provider Identifier (NPI)
 is not on file yet at a site.
  
 As a safeguard, providers are not imported if a name match is found by the
 import process for an existing entry in the NEW PERSON (#200) file.
  
 The providers loaded are eligible to be selected as encounter providers in
 the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) application and as ordering 
 providers in the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] 
 option.
  
 The import of data for non-VA providers into the NEW PERSON (#200) file 
 is optional.  Sites that elect not to import the non-VA provider data are 
 not required to do so, but please note that upcoming patches to the NEW 
 PERSON (#200) file will render this process non-functional and the 
 decision cannot be made to load the data at a later time.  All updates 
 should be completed prior to the install of patch XU*8*688.  No release 
 schedule is available for XU*8*688 at this time.
  
 Follow the 'Installation Guide - Non-VA Provider Updates (PSO*7.0*481)', 
 available on the VDL, for import instructions to load the VISN-specific 
 spreadsheet of provider data. (Note: Keep in mind when reviewing the 
 guide that the folder and file names are now numbered as "563" instead of 
 "481".)
  
  
 NOTE:  Non-VA provider import is not functionally testable in a
        mirror/test/non-production account.  The functionality can only be 
        exercised in a production environment.  
  
 Tracking System Ticket & Overview:
 ==================================
 RTC 994621: Non-VA Provider April 2019 Import
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The VA may upload a list of non-VA medical care providers into the VistA 
 system to maintain an accurate and updated list of non-VA providers in 
 the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (VACAA) 
 program.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------                  
 A new option was added by previous patch PSO*7.0*481 to the Maintenance 
 (Outpatient Pharmacy) [PSO MAINTENANCE] menu, Non-VA Provider Import [PSO 
 NON-VA PROVIDER IMPORT]. An additional new option, Non-VA Provider 
 Inactivate [PSO NON-VA PROVIDER INACTIVATE], allows for the inactivation 
 of providers which were previously filed by this patch if it is decided 
 later that the providers should not remain active due to workflow or other
 issues and a decision is made to inactive previously imported providers 
 with this utility, users will be prompted to enter the date of previous 
 import.
  
 Non-VA Provider Import [PSO NON-VA PROVIDER IMPORT] option, although on 
 the Maintenance (Outpatient Pharmacy) [PSO MAINTENANCE] menu, will not be
 executable by the pharmacy personnel due to directory permission issue and
 the import must be done by the installer of the patch who has permission
 to the directory where the Excel files will be placed for import.
  
 Non-VA Provider Inactivate [PSO NON-VA PROVIDER INACTIVATE] option is only
 accessible by users with programmer level access and is not attached to a
 menu.
  
 File Retrieval Instructions:
 ============================
 Updated CSV files containing April 2019 non-VA provider information is 
 now available.
  
 Software support personnel may retrieve the Non-VA Provider data files for
 their individual VISN and State(s) in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format
  
 Sites may retrieve the files directly using Secure File Transfer 
 Protocol (SFTP) from the "ANONYMOUS.PSO_563" directory at the following OI
 Field Office:
  
 Hines:                  domain.ext    
  
 File example: PSO_563_VISN_ST.csv
  
 VISN is the VISN number and ST is the state abbreviation for the files 
 containing the Non-VA Provider data.
  
 NOTE: After release of PSO*7.0*481, it was found that sites might still 
       be configured as VISN 18 even though VISN 18 is no longer a valid
       VISN. For that reason, sites which previously reported the issue
       also have files available in the VISN_18 folder.
  
  
 File Transfer Notes
 -------------------
 1. After deployment of PSO*7.0*481, it was found that the "ASCII" method 
    of transfer should be used for VMS sites.
  
 2. After several sites had difficulty importing files, it was found that 
    the files should first be transferred from the "anonymous" directory to
    the user's desktop. Then the files should be transferred to the site's 
    directory used for host files.  If files were transferred directly from
    the "anonymous" directory to the site's host file directory, the files
    would experience corruption rendering them incapable of being imported
    into VistA.
