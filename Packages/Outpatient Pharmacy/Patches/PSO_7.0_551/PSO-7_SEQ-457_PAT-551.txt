 Rational Defects:
 -----------------
  
 Defect: 738681
 --------------
 After accepting an eRx and sending it to Outpatient Pharmacy, when a user 
 attempts to "finish" a prescription using the "FN" action and selects 
 "YES" when prompted to attach the patient instructions to the provider 
 comments, an extra space will appear between the provider comments and 
 patient instructions.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSOERXU6 has been modified to remove the extra space between the 
 patient instructions and provider comments.
  
 Defect: 748657:
 ---------------
 No display of the eRx Look-Back value is present in the eRx Holding Queue 
 or the Patient Centric View.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSOERX and PSOERXC1 have been modified to display the eRx 
 Look-Back value in the header of the eRx Holding Queue and the Patient 
 Centric View.
  
 Defect: 842997:
 ---------------
 On the Patient Validation Screen, the "Pharmacy Narrative" field is 
 displaying a maximum of 60 characters instead of the required 250 
 characters.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSOERXP1 has been modified to allow the "Pharmacy Narrative" 
 field to display the required 250 characters.
  
 Defect: 862482
 --------------
 A user can lock the same patient in two different terminal sessions.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSOERX1A has been modified to prevent the user from locking the 
 same patient in two different terminal sessions. When a user attempts to 
 lock a patient in two different sessions, the message "You have this 
 patient locked in another open session" will appear and prevent the user 
 from completing the action.
  
 Defect: 862505
 --------------
 The lock functionality in Inbound eRx can be bypassed by using the search 
 function to search by eRx reference number, thus allowing a user to 
 access a record that is currently locked by another user.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSOERX and PSOERXC1 have been modified to include lock 
 functionality when searching by eRx reference number.
  
 Defect: 865086
 --------------
 The field "Code List Qualifier" is being displayed as "Quantity 
 Qualifier" on the eRx Print Screen, the Drug Validation Screen, and in 
 Outpatient Pharmacy.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The field "Quantity Qualifier has been changed to "Code List Qualifier" 
 on the eRx Print Screen, the Drug Validation Screen, and in Outpatient 
 Pharmacy.
  
 Defect: 874828
 --------------
 When a user accepts a validation on the Patient Validation Screen, and a 
 second user bypasses the lock functionality and accesses the same record 
 via the eRx Reference Number search, a hard error will occur when the 
 second user attempts to accept a validation on the Patient Validation 
 screen.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSOERX and PSOERXC1 have been modified to include lock 
 functionality when searching by eRx reference number.
  
 Defect: 874852
 --------------
 By using the eRx Reference Number Search feature, a user is able to 
 access records that are outside of the current, selected division.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSOERX and PSOERXC1 have been modified to prevent the user from 
 accessing records outside of the current, selected division. If the user 
 attempts to access records outside of the selected division, the message 
 "eRx does not belong to this division." will appear, and the user will be 
 blocked from completing the action.
  
 Defect: 877392
 --------------
 If a user attempts to send a Refill Request with no values defined in the 
 Payer Identification fields of the Benefits Coordination section, a hard 
 error occurs. To reproduce this scenario, the user must send a new 
 prescription to the eRx Holding Queue with no values defined in the Payer
 Identification fields of the Benefits Coordination section, accept all
 validations, accept the eRx and send it to Outpatient Pharmacy, then
 attempt the Refill Request.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSOERXX3 has been modified to allow empty fields in the Payer 
 Identification section of Benefits Coordination.
  
 Defect: 888567:
 ---------------
 If the maximum 210 characters are displayed in the eRx notes field of the 
 eRx Summary Screen, duplicate words will be displayed at the start of a 
 new line. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSOERX1 has been modified to prevent duplicate words from 
 displaying in the eRx Notes field of the eRx Summary Screen.
  
 Defect: 888603
 --------------
 A field titled "Comments" is displaying on the Patient Validation Screen.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSOERXP1 has been modified to remove the "Comments" field from 
 the Patient Validation Screen.
  
 Defect: 596375
 --------------
 When validating a drug, if a user selects "NO" when asked if they would 
 like to use the selected drug, the default prompt when the user is 
 returned back to the Drug Validation Screen is "Quit//"
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSOERXD2 has been modified to change the described default prompt 
 to "Edit//".
  
 Defect: 616456
 --------------
 The display of "Substitutions? :Yes/No" is not displaying on the eRx 
 Print Screen, the eRx Summary Screen, the Drug Validation Screen, the 
 Drug Validation Edit Screen, and in Outpatient Pharmacy.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 "Substitutions? :Yes/No" is now displaying on the eRx Print Screen, the 
 eRx Summary Screen, the Drug Validation Screen, the Drug Validation Edit 
 Screen, or in Outpatient Pharmacy.
  
 Defect: 728330
 --------------
 On the Patient Validation Screen, there is no column displaying the name 
 of the user who currently holds a lock against a particular patient.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The column "Last User" has been changed to "Locked by". The previous 
 column, "Last User", would display the name of the last user who accessed 
 the record of a particular patient. The new column, "Locked By", displays 
 the name of the user who currently holds a lock against a patient.
  
 Defect: 897118
 --------------
 The eRx Log displays an incorrect page number as well as preventing the 
 user from accessing the CMOP Log in Outpatient Pharmacy.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSOORAL1 has been modified to correct the issue displaying the 
 incorrect page number and preventing the user from accessing the CMOP Log.
  
 Defect: 733768
 --------------
 When entering a drug on the Drug Validation Screen, the Days Supply value 
 is not auto-calculated based off the Dose, Schedule, and Quantity entered 
 by the user.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Days Supply is now auto-calculated based on the Dose, Schedule, and 
 Quantity entered by the user. This functionality will only run if the 
 drug in question has required doses that the user is forced to choose 
 from, thus having a "Unit Per Dose" attached to the Dosage entered by the 
 user. Anytime an edit is made to the Dose, Schedule, or Quantity of an 
 existing drug, a new auto-calculation will occur for Days Supply. Anytime 
 an auto-calculation is made for Days Supply, the suggested value will be 
 displayed as the default answer to the prompt, however, the user is not 
 forced to accept this value. 
  
 Defect: 911602
 --------------
 When sending a Refill Request, the observation segment is incomplete on 
 the outbound message.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSOERXX3 and PSOERXA1 has been modified to include all data 
 elements from the Observation Segment.
  
 Defect 911576:
 --------------
 When sending a refill request, The Duration Segment of Structured Sig
 on the outbound message is incomplete.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSOERXX5 has been modified to include all data elements of the 
 Duration Segment of Structured Sig.
  
 Defect 914131:
 --------------
 The "DURATION" prompt is still a part of the workflow when creating a 
 drug, even though the eRx software does not offer tapering or complex 
 doses.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The "DURATION" prompt has been removed the eRx workflow when creating a 
 drug. 
  
 Defect 921703:
 --------------
 The user is unable to enter the Validate Drug Screen and edit the Days 
 Supply value of an eRx.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSOERXD2 has been modified to allow the user to edit the Days 
 Supply value on the Validate Drug Screen.

 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
  
 Back-out Procedures are only needed if there are major problems (examples 
 include the KIDS notice of incompletion or hard errors) resulting from the
 installation of this patch. You must have concurrence from Health Product
 Support before a rollback can occur. Enter a ServiceNow helpdesk ticket 
 to obtain this concurrence.
  
 Prior to installing a patch, the site/region should have saved a backup 
 of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport Global 
 [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install). The message 
 containing the backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" 
 function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function 
 "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up routines 
 onto the VistA System.
   
   
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
  
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the 
 PSO*7.0*551 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSO*7.0*551 in 
 the patch list section on line 2.
