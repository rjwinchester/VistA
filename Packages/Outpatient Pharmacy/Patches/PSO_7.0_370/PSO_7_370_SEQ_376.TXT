 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1.  INC000000398402 - Bad Address Suspense not printed
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 When Manila prints labels for their patients with a Routing of Mail, the 
 labels are printed as if the patient has a foreign address.
  
 This problem only occurs for Manila when printing a prescription mailing 
 label for a patient who lives in the Philippines.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Everywhere a label can be printed, a check needs to be added so if the 
 patient's country is Philippines and the site is Manila-RO, the label does
 not cause a foreign address to be triggered.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Need to modify routines PSOLLL1 and PSOSULBL to add the check for patient's 
 country as Philippines and the site as MANILA-RO and if so, do not mark the 
 label as a foreign address.
  
  
 2. INC000000528670 - Data Dictionary for Prescription file #52 Field 32
                      Correct Information Needed
 Problem:
 --------
 The LABEL DATE/TIME field (#32) of the PRESCRIPTION  file(#52) should not 
 have Help Text.  The fields defined within this multiple will have Help 
 Text defined which is displayed to the users.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the Data Dictionary of the PRESCRIPTION file to remove the Help 
 Text since the LABEL DATE/TIME is a multiple field.
  
 3. INC000000985113 -  Fileman internal date stored in Activity Log entry 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When editing a Refill Date on a prescription, the Activity Log entry
 is saved with the Fileman internal date format.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Need to modify processing so an external (user friendly) date format
 is stored in the Activity Log entry.  Routine PSORXED1 at tag PSORXED1+6
 will be modified.
  
 4. INC000000989343 -  PSO TECH ADV key
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A user that does not have the PSORPH key is able to put a prescription
 on hold using the pharmacist's full list of reasons.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify ^PSORXL so if the user does not have the PSORPH key or the PSO 
 TECH ADV key, they cannot put a prescription on hold.  Also, modify 
 FLD^PSOHLD so if the user does not have the PSORPH key, a limited
 subset of reason are available.
  
  
  
 5. INC000000623469 -  Finishing pharmacist name appears in the released
                          pharmacist's entry
 Problem:
 --------
 During Pharmacist verification of a Drug Interaction when Enhanced Order
 Checks are performed, the Pharmacist finishing the order is stored as 
 the Releasing Pharmacist.  This is field Pharmacist (#23) in the 
 Prescription file (#52). 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine BLD^PSODGDGP will be modified to store the Releasing Pharmacist 
 in this field.
