Subject: ONEVA ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
  
 1. VistA is receiving errors when requesting data from the Health 
 Data Repository (HDR).  These errors are not addressed by the 
 OneVA Pharmacy software.
  
 2. The Last Fill Date shows as Mail instead of Window for a remote refill
 on the OP Medications screen in Outpatient Backdoor.
  
 3. Outpatient Pharmacy documentation needs to be updated to correctly
 reflect the process for turning OneVA on/off.
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1.       INC0698370 - OneVA can't see patient's remote prescriptions
  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 VistA is receiving errors when requesting data from the Health 
 Data Repository (HDR) VIA the middleware. It is looking at two hard coded 
 conditions of "No Response" or "Connection Failed" to generate the "The 
 System is down or not responding" alert. By hard coding, the ONEA 
 pharmacy software did not cover other HL7 error messages that may occur. 
 This, giving false impression to the pharmacist as if the patient does 
 not have prescriptions at the host site.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A coding change was made to routine PSORRX1 to accommodate any error 
 message to the request that is returned by the middleware or the HL7 
 logical link configuration.
  
 2.       INC0908814 - OneVA Rx showing as Mail
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Last Fill Date shows as Mail instead of Window for a remote refill
 on the OP Medications screen in Outpatient Backdoor.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify processing so 'WINDOW' will display instead of 'MAIL' after the
 Last Fill Date.  Modify routine INIT+13^PSOR52 to set array entry
 PSOX("MAIL/WINDOW")="W" if it is not already set.
  
 3.       INC1033035 - Documentation changes needed
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Outpatient Pharmacy documentation needs to be updated to correctly
 reflect the process for turning OneVA on/off.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Update various manuals to reflect the correct process for turning 
 OneVA on/off.
  
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Augusta, GA
 Martinsburg, WV 
  
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 -------------------------------------------------
  
 The documentation can be obtained from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory 
 at one of the OI Field Offices. The preferred method is to retrieve files 
 from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may also 
 elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directory at the following OI Field Offices:
  
    OI FIELD OFFICE     ADDRESS                        DIRECTORY
    Hines               DOMAIN.EXT        
    Salt Lake City      DOMAIN.EXT          
   
 The documentation distribution includes:

  Installation Instructions:
  --------------------------
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  Staff should not be processing 
 prescriptions while patch is being installed.  This patch should take 
 less than 5 minutes to install.
  
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
    2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  From this menu, you may select to use the
       following options: 
       when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the patch # PSO*7.0*532:
  
         a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch 
            routines, DDs, templates, etc.
  
         c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
  
    4. From the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
       choose the patch to install.
  
    5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', respond NO.
  
    6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
    7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first
 2 lines of the routines contained in the patch. The second line
 will contain the patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;DEC 1997;Build 349 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] 
 can be run to compare the routine checksums to what is documented
 in the patch description.
  
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation
 of development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision
 between development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should
 have saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the
 Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at
 time of install). The message containing the backed up routines can
 be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action
 prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used
 to install the backed up routines onto the VistA System. 
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2
 lines of the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option
 First Line Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines
 contained in the PSO*7.0*532 patch have been rolled back, the first
 two lines of the Routines will no longer contain the designation
 of patch PSO*7.0*532 in the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
