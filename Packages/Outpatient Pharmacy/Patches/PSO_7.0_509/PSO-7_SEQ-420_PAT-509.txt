 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1.       I17894075FY18 - Pharmacist not showing up for partial in 
                          View Prescription; typo in HELP-PROMPT
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 For a PARTIAL Rx, the name of the releasing pharmacist is correctly
 present in the Activity Log under Patient Prescription Processing,
 but is absent when displaying the same information in View Prescription.
 Also, there is a typo in the HELP-PROMPT for field PHARMACIST NAME (#.05)
 Of the PARTIAL DATE sub-file (#52.2) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52). The 
 word partial is misspelled.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the system so the releasing pharmacist correctly displays in
 View Prescription.
  
 Modify PAR+10^PSORXVW1 to pull pharmacist info from the PHARMACIST NAME
 field (#.05, 0;5) of the PARTIAL DATE sub-file (#52.2) of the 
 PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
  
 Modify the HELP-PROMPT to correct the spelling of the word partial for
 field PHARMACIST NAME (#.05) of the PARTIAL DATE sub-file (#52.2) of the
 PRESCRIPTION file (#52).
  
  
 2. I18165455FY18 - OneVA Issue for Refill and Partial
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When entering a Refill or Partial for a remote prescription and
 the user enters NO to the prompt 'Would you like to use this drug?',
 the system does not acknowledge the NO answer and continues processing
 as if the user answered YES.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine PSORRX1 so if the user answers NO to the question
 'Would you like to use this drug?', the system will stop processing.

 *** Patch PSO*7.0*497 MUST be installed prior to installing this patch. 
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
  
 This patch should be installed during non-peak hours.
 It should take less than 2 minutes to install this patch.
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
    2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  From this menu, you may select to use the
       following options: 
       when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the patch # PSO*7.0*509:
  
         a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch 
            routines, DDs, templates, etc.
  
         c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.

       Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
    7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
  
 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first
 2 lines of the routines contained in the patch. The second line
 will contain the patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;DEC 1997;Build 349 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] 
 can be run to compare the routine checksums to what is documented
 in the patch description.
  
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation
 of development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision
 between development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should
 have saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the
 Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at
 time of install). The message containing the backed up routines can
 be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action
 prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used
 to install the backed up routines onto the VistA System. 
  
 While no data was modified by this patch installation there was a 
 change  to the FileMan Data Dictionary for the Prescription file (#52),
 Partial sub-file (#52.2), Pharmacist Name field (#.05). It was a minor
 change to the description and does not require changing back. Therefore,
 no rollback strategy is required.
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2
 lines of the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option
 First Line Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines
 contained in the PSO*7.0*509 patch have been rolled back, the first
 two lines of the Routines will no longer contain the designation
 of patch PSO*7.0*509 in the patch list section on line 2.
