Problem: 
"BLD",10879,1,22,0)
--------
"BLD",10879,1,23,0)
The Marion VA Medical Center reported getting an <UNDEFINED> error when trying
"BLD",10879,1,24,0)
to print local labels in the RX SUSPENSE file (#52.5). Upon further analysis
"BLD",10879,1,25,0)
it was determined that a bad "AC" cross-reference entry in the RX SUSPENSE
"BLD",10879,1,26,0)
file (#52.5) is causing the problem. Although the cross-reference is set, the
"BLD",10879,1,27,0)
record it is pointing to is no longer present on the file which consequently
"BLD",10879,1,28,0)
causes the routine PSOSULBL to error out with an <UNDEFINED> error at BEG+6.
"BLD",10879,1,29,0)
        
"BLD",10879,1,30,0)
Resolution:
"BLD",10879,1,31,0)
-----------
"BLD",10879,1,32,0)
The reason why the "AC" cross-reference entry was not deleted along with the
"BLD",10879,1,33,0)
original record could not be identified. However, this patch modifies the
"BLD",10879,1,34,0)
routine PSOSULBL to prevent the <UNDEFINED> error from happening when the
"BLD",10879,1,35,0)
corrupted "AC" cross-reference is present. Furthermore, the PSOSULBL routine
"BLD",10879,1,36,0)
was also modified to clean up the corrupt "AC" cross-reference.
"BLD",10879,1,37,0)
  
"BLD",10879,1,38,0)
Technical Resolution:
"BLD",10879,1,39,0)
---------------------
"BLD",10879,1,40,0)
Changed the routine PSOSULBL at line tag BEG and TMP to prevent the
"BLD",10879,1,41,0)
<UNDEFINED> error and to kill off the corrupt "AC" cross-reference entry.
