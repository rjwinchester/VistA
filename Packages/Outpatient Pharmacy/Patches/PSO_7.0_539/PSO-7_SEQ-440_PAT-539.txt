 Problem: 
 --------
 The Marion VA Medical Center reported getting an <UNDEFINED> error when trying
 to print local labels in the RX SUSPENSE file (#52.5). Upon further analysis
 it was determined that a bad "AC" cross-reference entry in the RX SUSPENSE
 file (#52.5) is causing the problem. Although the cross-reference is set, the
 record it is pointing to is no longer present on the file which consequently
 causes the routine PSOSULBL to error out with an <UNDEFINED> error at BEG+6.
         
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The reason why the "AC" cross-reference entry was not deleted along with the
 original record could not be identified. However, this patch modifies the
 routine PSOSULBL to prevent the <UNDEFINED> error from happening when the
 corrupted "AC" cross-reference is present. Furthermore, the PSOSULBL routine
 was also modified to clean up the corrupt "AC" cross-reference.
   
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed the routine PSOSULBL at line tag BEG and TMP to prevent the
 <UNDEFINED> error and to kill off the corrupt "AC" cross-reference entry.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 It is not necessary to disable any options.  
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------ 
 This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize potential
 disruption to users. This patch should take less than 2 minutes to install.
  
   
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
   
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the  
    Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following
    options.  When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch #  
    (ex. PSO*7.0*539):
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not backup any
       other changes, such as DDs or templates.
    
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
       is installed. It compares all components of this patch:  routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
       
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
       global.
   
 4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    choose the patch to install.
  
 5. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
    NO//" respond NO.  
   
 6. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
  
 7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
  
 Post Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 None.
  
   
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
