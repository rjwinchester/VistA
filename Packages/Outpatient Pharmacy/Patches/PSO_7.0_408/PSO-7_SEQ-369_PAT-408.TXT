Description:
============

 The Safety Updates for the Medication Prescription Management (SUMPM)
 project adds a new module to the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 application,
 which will be used for enabling the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
 pharmacies to comply with Mandatory Reporting to State Controlled
 Substance Rx Databases required by Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012,
 PL 112-74. Also known as State Prescription Monitoring Program (SPMP), the
 program is a state electronic database which collects designated data on
 controlled substances dispensed. The states then distribute data from the
 database to individuals who are authorized under state law to receive the
 information for purposes of their profession. The information must be
 reported using the American Society for Automation in Pharmacy (ASAP) data
 format, which was developed by the Alliance of States with Prescription
 Monitoring Programs and the National Association of State Controlled
 Substances Authorities.
  
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            ***IMPORTANT***
 In order to manage the complex technical nature of implementing 
 transmissions from VHA to the various State Prescription Monitoring 
 Programs (SPMPs), patch PSO*7*408 will undergo a controlled activation 
 schedule. All VA medical centers will receive the patch simultaneously
 upon its national release, with an expectation that it will be installed
 within the standard 30-day compliance period. Independently, the actions
 necessary to set the state-specific parameters and begin actual 
 transmissions will be governed by a phased implementation schedule. 
 Communications to each site will be initiated by the OI&T Field Operations
 Implementation Manager in conjunction with a representative from Pharmacy
 Benefits Management. 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 The new menu called State Prescription Monitoring Program (SPMP) Menu
 [PSO SPMP MENU] can be found under the Supervisor Functions [PSO
 SUPERVISOR] menu option. The following options will be available under
 this new menu:
  
 1. View ASAP Definitions [PSO SPMP VIEW ASAP DEFINITIONS]
    ------------------------------------------------------
    This option allows the user to visualize the ASAP data format and the
    data elements reported to the states. It provides detailed information
    about each segment and field for the ASAP format versions 1995, 3.0,
    4.0, 4.1 and 4.2.
  
 2. View/Edit SPMP State Parameters [PSO SPMP STATE PARAMETERS]  
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    This option is used for viewing or editing the SPMP parameters for a 
    specific state. The following fields can be updated via this option:
  
       ASAP VERSION
       TRANSMIT RETURN TO STOCK*
       INCLUDE NON-VETERAN PATIENTS
       REPORTING FREQUENCY IN DAYS
       VMS LOCAL DIRECTORY
       UNIX/LINUX LOCAL DIRECTORY
       WINDOWS/NT LOCAL DIRECTORY
       FILE NAME PREFIX
       FILE EXTENSION
       STATE FTP SERVER IP ADDRESS
       STATE FTP SERVER USERNAME
       STATE FTP SERVER PORT #
       STATE FTP SERVER PASSWORD
       STATE FTP SERVER DIRECTORY
       SFTP TRANSMISSION MODE
       SFTP PRIVATE KEY TEXT**
       SFTP PUBLIC KEY TEXT**
  
    *  Visible only if ASAP VERSION is 1995
    ** Visible only if SFTP TRANSMISSION MODE is set to A - AUTOMATIC 
   
 3. View/Export Single Prescription [PSO SPMP SINGLE RX VIEW/EXPORT]
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    This option is used for visualizing a specific prescription and the data
    related to a specific fill that is transmitted to the state in the ASAP 
    format.
   
 4. View Export Batch [PSO SPMP BATCH VIEW/EXPORT]
    ----------------------------------------------
    The information reported to the states are first compiled into a batch,
    which can be for a single prescription or a collection of prescriptions
    for a determined date range. This option allows the user to visualize 
    information contained in one batch as well as the list of prescriptions
    in the batch. This option also allows the user to manually export the
    batch to the state.
  
 5. Export Batch Processing [PSO SPMP BATCH PROCESSING]
    ---------------------------------------------------
    This option is used to monitor all the batches used to transmit data to
    the states. The user selects a date range and a list of batches is
    presented where the user can select to perform different actions on a
    specific batch.
  
 6. Accounting Of Disclosures Report [PSO SPMP DISCLOSURE REPORT]
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    This option is used for generating a list of prescriptions transmitted
    to states. This option allows for a date range selection as well as
    one, multiple or all states and one, multiple or all patients. The list
    is sorted by state and then by patient. 
  
 7. Unmark Rx Fill as Administered In Clinic [PSO SPMP UNMARK ADMIN CLINIC]
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    This option is used to unmark prescriptions as 'Administered In Clinic'.
    Administered in clinic prescription fills are not transmitted to the 
    states. This option enables the user to unmark fills that have been
    mistakenly marked as 'Administered In Clinic' and subsequently transmit
    them to the state.
  
 This patch also runs a post-install routine that automatically schedules
 the option Scheduled SPMP Data Export [PSO SPMP SCHEDULED EXPORT] to run
 at 1:00AM. Once the site is activated, data will be transmitted to the
 state based on the frequency in the scheduled task. This option is listed
 as a scheduled task under the Queue Background Jobs [PSO AUTOQUEUE JOBS]
 option under the Maintenance (Outpatient Pharmacy) [PSO MAINTENANCE] menu.
 This option can also be edited via the Schedule/Unschedule [XUTM SCHEDULE]
 option.
