  Pre-Installation Instructions:
  =============================
  This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
  recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
  potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
  minutes to install.
  
  
  Installation Instructions:
  -------------------------- 
  
  Pharmacy users should not be processing prescriptions while patch is 
  being installed. It should take less than 5 minutes to install this
  patch.
  
  1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
   
  2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PacMan option. 
   
  3. From the Kernal Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
     Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may select to use the
     following options.
     
     When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch # (PSO*7.0*501):
  
    a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
        back up any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this 
        patch is installed. It compares all components of this patch
        (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
  
    c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the

  6. If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//' Respond NO
  
  7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' Respond 0.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;[DATE];[BUILD #] 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSO*7.0*501 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PS0*7.0*501 in
 the patch list section on line 2.
