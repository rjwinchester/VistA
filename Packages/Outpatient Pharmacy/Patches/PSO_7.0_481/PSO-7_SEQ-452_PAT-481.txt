Description:
============

 On August 7, 2014, the President signed into law PL 113-146, the Veterans 
 Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (VACAA). The law offers an 
 additional authority for Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to expand
 current capacity and ensure that Veterans have timely access to high
 quality care. 
  
 The law creates a new paradigm for providing health care set forth in the
 Veterans Choice program provisions within Title I Section 101 of VACAA. 
 Veterans Affairs (VA) is utilizing a Contractor to provide health care and
 third party administrative (TPA) services set forth through VACAA Section
 101. 
  
 As a result of this law, VA must upload a list of non-VA medical care
 providers into the VistA system in order to maintain an accurate and
 updated list of non-VA providers in the Choice program.
  
 This patch will allow importing of "new" non-VA providers into the
 NEW PERSON (#200) file.  A "new" provider is defined as a provider whose
 National Provider Identifier (NPI) is not on file yet at a site.
  
 As a safeguard, providers are not imported if a name match is found by 
 the import process for an existing entry in the NEW PERSON (#200) file.
  
 The providers loaded by this patch are eligible to be selected as 
 encounter providers in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) 
 application but not as ordering providers. They may be used as ordering
 providers in the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
 option.
  
 After patch PSO*7*481 is installed, sites will have the option to import 
 data for non-VA providers into the NEW PERSON (#200) file.  Follow the 
 Non-VA Provider Import (PSO*7.0*481) Deployment, Installation, Back-out 
 and Rollback Guide for import instructions to load the VISN-specific
 spreadsheet of provider data.  Sites that elect not to import the non-VA 
 provider data are not required to do so, but please note that upcoming 
 patches to the NEW PERSON (#200) file will render this process 
 non-functional and the decision cannot be made to load the data at a 
 later time.  All updates should be completed prior to the install of 
 patch XU*8*688.
  
 NOTE:  This patch will not be functionally testable in a
 mirror/test/non-production account.  The functionality from this patch can
 only be exercised in a production environment.  
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket & Overview:
 -----------------------------------------
 CA-SDM I12935021FY17: Non-VA Provider Import
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The VA must upload a list of non-VA medical care providers into the VistA 
 system in order to maintain an accurate and updated list of non-VA 
 providers in the Choice program.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------                  
 A new option is added to the Maintenance (Outpatient Pharmacy)
 [PSO MAINTENANCE] menu, Non-VA Provider Import [PSO NON-VA PROVIDER
 IMPORT]. An additional new option, Non-VA Provider Inactivate [PSO NON-VA
 PROVIDER INACTIVATE], will allow for the inactivation of providers which
 were previously filed by this patch if it is decided later that the
 providers should not remain active due to workflow or other issues.
  
 Non-VA Provider Import [PSO NON-VA PROVIDER IMPORT] option, although on 
 the Maintenance (Outpatient Pharmacy) [PSO MAINTENANCE] menu, will not be
 executable by the pharmacy personnel due to directory permission issue and
 the import must be done by the installer of the patch who has permission
 to the directory where the Excel files will be placed for import.
  
 Non-VA Provider Inactivate [PSO NON-VA PROVIDER INACTIVATE] option is only
 accessible by users with programmer level access and is not attached to a
 menu.
  
 Non-VA Provider Import [PSO NON-VA PROVIDER IMPORT] option 
 (Routine PSONVAP2):
  
 Once the data is imported from Excel files and filed into the 
 NEW PERSON (#200) file, MailMan messages are sent to the holders of the
 PSDMGR key containing information about:
  
 1. Providers which were filed successfully
 2. Providers which were not filed due to duplication of NPI's, etc.

 Non-VA Provider Inactivate [PSO NON-VA PROVIDER INACTIVATE] option 
 (Routine PSONVAP4):
  
 This routine will inactivate providers which were previously imported 
 using the Non-VA Provider Import [PSO NON-VA PROVIDER IMPORT] option.
 Inactivation will be needed if it is decided later that the providers
 should not remain active due to workflow or other issues. Programmer
 access is required for this option.  It is not located within a menu but
 can be invoked directly by someone with the XUPROG security key.
  
 See the Non-VA Provider Import (PSO*7.0*481) Deployment, Installation, 
 Back-out and Rollback Guide for more information.
