Subject: ALLERGY CHECK ISSUES, PRINT FROM SUSPENSE LABEL PRINTING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issues: 
  
 1. When invoking the CK (Check Interaction) action in the Outpatient
    Pharmacy Medication Profile screen, Non-VA and pending orders which do
    not contain dispense drugs do not receive allergy checks.
  
 2. When invoking the CK (Check Interaction) action in the Outpatient
    Pharmacy Medication Profile screen, the business rule for performing
    allergy checks on discontinued orders is not being followed.
  
 3. The option Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] might erroneously skip
    printing some labels for orders which previously had labels printed but
    were put back on suspense and do need new labels.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) Overview:
 ==========================================
  
 1. I9856734FY16 - CK action Allergy checks on Non-VA and Pending Orders
   
    PSPO #2896
  
    Problem:
    --------
    
    When invoking the CK (Check Interactions) hidden action in the 
    Outpatient Pharmacy Medication Profile screen, allergy checks will not
    occur for non-VA or pending orders that only have an orderable item
    assigned. This situation can occur if a free text dosage is specified 
    during the ordering process.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
  
    Modify routine PSOUTL to perform allergy checks against non-VA and 
    pending orders which only contain an orderable item and no dispense
    drug.  
    
    Routine: PSOUTL
  
 2. I9857987FY16 - CK action Allergy checks on Discontinued OrdersCK 
                   action Allergy checks on Discontinued Orders
  
    
    PSPO #3178
  
    Problem:
    --------
  
    When invoking the CK (Check Interactions) hidden action in the 
    Outpatient Pharmacy Medication Profile screen, all discontinued orders
    on the patient's profile receive allergy checks. However, the VA
    business rule to only check discontinued orders if the "Cancel Date +
    Days Supply + 7 is equal to or greater than today's date" is not being
    followed.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
  
    Modify routine PSOUTL to follow the VA business rule for allergy 
    checking on discontinued orders when invoking the CK action.
    
    Routine: PSOUTL
  
 3. R8126525FY16 - Print from Suspense File Option Label Printing Issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
  
    If the PRESCRIPTION (#52) file's label log shows that a label has been 
    printed for a prescription at any time in the past, option "Print from 
    Suspense File" will delete the prescription from the RX SUSPENSE 
    (#52.5) file without printing a label.  There is no notification to the
    user other than an entry in the activity log.  However, the
    prescription may have been newly put on suspense and requires an
    additional label since the first one may have been printed by mistake.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
  
    Modified the Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] option and routine
    PSOSULBL to print all labels which are on suspense and display under
    option Log of Suspended Rx's by Day [PSO PNDLOG] as not having been
    printed since being put on suspense. The logic of checking the PRINTED
    (#2) field in the RX SUSPENSE (#52.5) file continues to be performed by
    this patch.  This field resets to "not printed" when a prescription is
    put back on suspense and is set to "printed" when the label prints.
  
    The logic which also checked the label log in the PRESCRIPTION (#52)
    file has been removed from option Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL]
    option. This logic was introduced with patch PSO*7.0*427 and remains in
    the other functionality added by PSO*7.0*427.
  
     Routine: PSOSULBL
