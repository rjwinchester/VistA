Subject: MOCHA 2.1B WARRANTY ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 The Medication Order Check HealthCare Application (MOCHA) 2.1B patches 
 implement Max Daily Dose Order Checks for simple medication orders 
 entered through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), Inpatient 
 Medications and Outpatient Pharmacy. If the Daily Dose exceeds the First 
 Databank (FDB) recommended Max Daily Dose, a warning shall be displayed 
 to the user. If the Max Daily Dose Order Check cannot be performed, an 
 error message will be displayed to the user, along with general dosing 
 information for the drug in most cases.
  
 This patch is part of the warranty period and includes minor fixes for the
 MOCHA Enhancements 2.1B group of builds. A multiple package host file was
 created to simplify installation at Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
 facilities for the other portions. The combined host file
 MOCHA_2_1_WARRANTY_OR_PSO_PSJ.KID contains OR*3.0*481, PSJ*5.0*358 and
 PSO*7.0*518. In addition, there is this standalone Pharmacy Data
 Management patch, PSS*1.0*224, which must be installed in conjunction with
 the other builds.
              
  
 The Outpatient MOCHA v2.1B warranty fixes will provide the following
 corrections:
  
 The Recommended Frequency message, when displayed in Outpatient Pharmacy,
 will now always be the last Dosing Order Check message to display.
  
 An invalid order check message can display in Pharmacy and Computerized 
 Patient Record System (CPRS) indicating that order checks cannot be done 
 for a Profile Supply entry, when entering a medication. This will occur 
 when the Supply entry is Pending in Outpatient Pharmacy, and it only has 
 a Pharmacy Orderable Item defined (No DRUG (#50) File entry) as part of 
 the Pending order, and the Pharmacy Orderable Item is set up properly, 
 and has more than one supply matched to it that is active and marked for 
 Outpatient Usage.
  
 The BSA/CRCL headers were not displayed on OP Medication Order Detail 
 screens (New OP Order (Routine) and Pending OP Order) and OP Patient 
 Information screens (PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS and PSO LMOE Finish).
  
 The available dosages list was not breaking according to formal 
 requirements.
  
 The message "Now Renewing Rx # XXXX Drug: XXXXX" is scrolling off of the
 screen.
  
 A scenario was discovered where the General Dosing Guidelines displayed
 in Outpatient Pharmacy for a complex order when a combination of 'And'
 and 'Then' conjunctions were used in the order. General Dosing Guidelines 
 should never appear in a complex order, this patch resolves this issue.
  
 Various formatting issues were corrected in the display of Dosing 
 messages.

 particularly medication activities.
  
 Installation should take less than one minute.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
 MOCHA Warranty software must be installed together in the following 
 sequence:
  
      Component                       File Name
    1 PSS*1.0*224                     PSS_1_224.KID
    2 MOCHA Warranty Combined Build   MOCHA_2_1_WARRANTY_OR_PSO_PSJ.KID
  
 **********************************NOTE************************************
 Routine PSJORUTL was modified in PSJ*5*256 but not updated in the FORUM 
 database. It is added here to update FORUM. The checksum in VistA will 
 equal the After checksum (21381210) both before and after the installation
 of the MOCHA_2_1_WARRANTY_OR_PSO_PSJ.KID which contains PSJ*5.0*358.
 **********************************NOTE************************************
  
 **********************************NOTE************************************
 When comparing the second line of PSGS0 using option COMPARE TRANSPORT 
 GLOBAL TO CURRENT SYSTEM, there will be a warning message "*** WARNING, 
 you are missing one or more Patches ***". The warning is referring to 
 PSJ*5*353 which is still under development. This warning is expected and 
 you may continue to install the MOCHA 2.1b Warranty patches. The second 
 line of PSGS0 will be fixed when PSJ*5*353 is released. See item #6 in 
 the Description section of patch PSJ*5*358 for more details.
 **********************************NOTE***********************************
  
 1. Download MOCHA_2_1_WARRANTY_OR_PSO_PSJ.KID into your local directory.
  
 2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
    select the Installation menu.
  
 3. Use Load a Distribution. You may need to prepend a directory 
    name. When prompted for "Enter a Host File:", respond with
    MOCHA_2_1_WARRANTY_OR_PSO_PSJ.KID.
  
      Example: USER$:[ABC]MOCHA_2_1_WARRANTY_OR_PSO_PSJ.KID
  
 4. From the Installation menu, you may then select to use the following
    three options. These options are optional. If used, when prompted for
    the INSTALL NAME, enter MOCHA 2.1 COMBINED WARRANTY BUILD 1.0.
  
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
         Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the 
         components of the KIDS build.
  
         Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
         is installed.
  
 5. Select the installation option Backup a Transport Global. This 
    option will create a backup message of any routines exported with 
    this patch in case you need to backout this patch. It will not backup
    any other changes such as Data Dictionaries (DD's) or templates. It 
    is important this step be followed, because if backout of this patch 
    is necessary, having this backup will make the process much easier.
  
 6. Select the Installation option Install Package(s). This is the 
    step to start the installation of this KIDS patch: 
   
    a. Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch install 
       and enter MOCHA 2.1 COMBINED WARRANTY BUILD 1.0 at the INSTALL NAME
       prompt.
  
    b. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//' answer NO.
  
    c. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
       and Protocols? NO//' answer NO.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 ==============================
 None
  
  
 Backout Procedures:
 ==================
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of the 
 development team, the support team and appropriate VA site/region 
 personnel. The decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint 
 decision between these groups.
  
 Prior to installing the combined build, the site/region should have saved 
 a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport
 Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of installation).
  
 The message containing the backed-up routines can be installed with the 
 "Xtract PackMan" action at the Message Action prompt, then PackMan 
 function 6 - INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE. This will install the backed up 
 routines onto the VistA system. If for some reason the backup is not 
 available, one can be provided by customer support or the development 
 team.
  
 The PSO*7*518 patch also exported three List Templates. List Templates are
 normally not backed up prior to patch installation. The original List
 Templates can be sent upon request. Please call the national help 
 desk or enter a helpdesk ticket if the original List Templates are needed.
  
  
 ******************************** Note********************************
  
 Installing the backup for this combined build will back out 3 patches, 
 OR*3.0*481, PSJ*5.0*358 and PSO*7.0*518. The standalone patch PSS*1.0*224 
 will also need to be backed out. Use the following sequence if it is 
 determined a back-out is necessary:
 1.       Backup of MOCHA 2.1 COMBINED WARRANTY BUILD 1.0
 2.       Backup of PSS*1.0*224 ***must be done immediately after step 1***
 3.       List Templates replaced as soon as possible after step 2 but not
          required to be immediate
 **************************************************************************
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
 =================================
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the Routines contained in these patches using the First Line Routine Print
 [XU FIRST LINE PRINT] option. Once the routines contained in the combined
 build have been rolled back, the second lines of the routines will no 
 longer contain the designation of the new patches.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997;Build 3
