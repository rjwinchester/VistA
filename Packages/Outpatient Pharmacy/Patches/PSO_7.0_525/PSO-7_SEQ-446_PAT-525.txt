 Item #1:
 --------
 The option List of Patients/Prescriptions for Recall Notice [PSO RECALL 
 LIST] has been modified to correctly identify the Lot # of each individual
 prescription fill (original, refill or partial; locally dispensed or CMOP)
 so that all prescription fills with that Lot # are accurately reported.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Line tag LOT^PSORLST2 has been modified to also check the CMOP node 
 for a CMOP fill (original or refill) and include it in the report.
  
  
 Item #2:
 --------
 The prompt for selection of the medication route when entering an
 outpatient prescription has been modified to list only those routes
 associated with the dosage form for the selected medication (short list).
 The system will allow partial matches that are found in the short list
 or an exact full-text match or an abbreviation match if found in the
 MEDICATION ROUTES file (#51.2).
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSOORED5 and PSOBKDED were modified with the following:
 1. If a default med route is not defined in the orderable item, med route 
    will be set to null (will not default to PO or ORAL).
 2. A "?" at the ROUTE prompt, will display a short list of routes that
    were defined in the orderable item, and the prompt for the short list
    selection will be "Select MED ROUTE: ".
 3. Partial match will pick a med route only if found in the short list
    (not from the long list).
 4. An exact match of the full route name or an abbreviated route name will
    also pick a med route.
 5. Existing functionality supporting "??" is retained.  Entering "??" at 
    the ROUTE prompt will display all routes that have been defined for all
    orderable item. When typing in a route, if no match is found, then "??"
    is displayed.

 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes
 to install. 
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch 
     PSO*7*525.
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  Select the installation option Backup a Transport Global. This 
     option will create a backup message of any routines exported with 
     this patch in case you need to back-out this patch. It will not backup
     any other changes such as Data Dictionaries (DD's) or templates. It 
     is important this step be followed, because if back-out of this patch 
     is necessary, having the backup will make the process much easier.
  
 5.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//', answer 'NO'.  
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//', answer 'NO'
  
 8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//', answer 'NO'.
  
 9.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//', respond 0.
  
  
 POST-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
  ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;DEC 1997;[BUILD #] 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out Procedures are only needed if there are major problems (examples 
 include the KIDS notice of incompletion or hard errors) resulting from the
 installation of this patch. You must have concurrence from Health Product
 Support before a rollback can occur. Enter a ServiceNow ticket to obtain
 this concurrence.
  
 Prior to installing a patch, the site/region should have saved a backup of
 the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport Global [XPD
 BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install). The message
 containing the backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan"
 function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK
 MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA
 System.
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSO*7.0*525 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSO*7.0*525 in
 the patch list section on line 2.
