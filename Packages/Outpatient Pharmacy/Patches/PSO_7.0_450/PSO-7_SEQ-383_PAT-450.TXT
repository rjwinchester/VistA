Subject: PSO PHYSICIAN AND ORDER EDIT FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses (3) issues:
  
 1. When editing a new prescription, if a user accepts the prescription 
    after using the up caret ("^") when editing, the prescription will be
    deleted.
  
 2. Users are able to jump to fields that are not allowed when using the 
    Edit Provider option [PSO PROVIDER EDIT]. 
  
 3. When editing a new prescription, if a user allows a timeout at the 
    Noun Prompt, no changes made prior will be saved.

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
  
 1. INC000000471452 - Up Arrow Deletes Order when Editing 
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When entering a new order, Patient Prescription Processing 
     [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] if a user enters "NO" in
     response to the prompt "Is this correct", the user is given the
     opportunity to change the entries made during the initial input.  The
     user is presented with a review screen displaying the editable items
     for the order.  If the user enters 5, for Dosage, the user is 
     able to change up to 6 items.  If the up caret ("^") is entered (to 
     exit editing) for any of these items, the user is returned to 
     the review screen and given the opportunity to either Accept, 
     or Edit another item.  When the user enters Accept, the new order
     currently being entered is DELETED.  If the new order was to replace a
     current order that order is NOT DISCONTINUED.
    
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified PSOORED5 to recognize, when user enters "^" during 
     editing process, the user is not trying to exit the OPTION, 
     but only exit the editing of the new order.  Check if EDIT 
     is being performed, and if so, delete "^" flag (DUOUT) and 
     continue processing at the point where a modified SIG is 
     updated.  The order is subsequently saved, and if applicable, 
     replaces any current duplicate order. Modified PSOBKDED to 
     recognize when the user is in edit mode and consequently not 
     overlay any modified responses with system defaults.
  
  
    Routines: PSOORED5, PSOBKDED
  
  
 2) INC000001072835 - Jump Back Problem
  
   
     Problem:
     --------
     When a user is using the Edit Provider option [PSO PROVIDER EDIT],
     questions like DEA EXPIRATION DATE field (#747.44) are being asked
     when they shouldn't be.  Additionally, jumping back to previous
     questions is not being allowed.
  
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Investigation into this OPTION reveals that certain questions are
     skipped via branching logic based on the answer to the PROVIDER
     TYPE.  Following are the various valid responses to this field:
            
            1    FULL TIME
            2    PART TIME
            3    C & A
            4    FEE BASIS
            5    HOUSE STAFF
     
     If the user responds with anything other than FEE BASIS (#4), the
     following fields are skipped, via branching logic:
             
             747.44      DEA EXPIRATION DATE
                 29      SERVICE/SECTION
             8932.1      PERSON CLASS
     
     Therefore, DEA EXPIRATION DATE is a valid jump to field, if the 
     PROVIDER TYPE is FEE BASIS.  The branching logic and subsequent 
     up caret jump logic must be modified to recognize which PROVIDER 
     TYPE has been selected, and react accordingly via switching the 
     following fields which are asked, and which are available for 
     up caret jumping.  This will be accomplished with splitting up 
     the original DR string into Continuation-DR strings.
  
  
    Routine: PSOPRVW
  
 3) I6623146FY16 - Timeout problem
  
   
    Problem:
    --------
  
     When a user edits a new prescription, Patient Prescription Processing 
     [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] if they make a change prior to the NOUN
     prompt and allow a timeout at that prompt, no changes will be saved.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
   
     Modify routine PSOORED5 to allow the changes made to be saved.
