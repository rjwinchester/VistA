Description:
============

 1. INC5135935 - Tech order entry in VistA not being converted to

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC5135935 - Tech order entry in VistA not being converted to CPRS note
                 correctly.
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Wichita Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC) reported that when
 outpatient orders placed by a technician in backdoor pharmacy and verified
 by pharmacist, the name of the technician appears under the "Pharmacist"
 field of the CPRS order details screen. The VERIFYING PHARMACIST (#104) 
 field of the PRESCRIPTION (#52) file and not the FINISHING PERSON (#38) 
 field should show up under the "Pharmacist" field of the CPRS order
 details screen.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch makes a code change to check if the order is having a VERIFYING
 PHARMACIST (#104) field, then to pull that data value as the "Pharmacist"
 field on the CPRS details of the order.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed routine PSOORRL at OEL+11 label to get the data of the
 "Pharmacist" field of the CPRS order details from the VERIFYING 
 PHARMACIST (#104) field first. Otherwise, to pull it from the FINISHING
 PERSON (#38) field.
  
  
 2. INC5849471 - Outpatient Rx Profile report has incorrect page numbering.
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When printing the Outpatient Rx Profile report the report will display the
 first 2 pages numbered with page 1. The first page 1 includes the patient
 name/DOB/address as a header and the 2nd page is numbered page 1
 incorrectly.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch makes code changes that correct the pagination of the 
 Outpatient RX Profile Report.  
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed routines PSODEMSB and PSOPATLK so that any logical use of the 
 variable PG is updated to use the variable PAGE.
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Central California HCS (Fresno)
