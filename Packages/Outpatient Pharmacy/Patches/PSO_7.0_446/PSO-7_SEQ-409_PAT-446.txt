 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) Overview:
 ==========================================
 1. I9896500FY16 - Request for site ID in subject line/PSO EXTERNAL 
                   DISPENSE Message
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 When OPAI (Outpatient Pharmacy Automated Interface) tries to release a 
 prescription and it is unable to match the release information with a 
 prescription fill on file it will create a Mailman message alerting users
 about the issue. The problem for integrated sites with multiple sites 
 using OPAI is that the Mailman message does not identify which site the
 release information was for, prompting all the sites to lookup the Rx
 record to find out whether it belongs to them or not.
  
 Current message subject: "External Dispense - Rx Release Attempted" 
  
 Resolution: 
 -----------
 The Mailman message subject was modified to include the Site Number at the
 beginning. This will be consistent with other mailman messages that 
 already identify the Rx site in the message subject.
   
 New message subject: "500 External Dispense - Rx Release Attempted" 
   
 Technical Resolution: 
 ---------------------
 Modify routine PSOHLDI1 at tag MAIL+13: add the following code: 
  
 S XMSUB=$S($G(PSOSITE):$$GET1^DIQ(59,PSOSITE,.06)_" ",1:"")_"External 
 Dispense - Rx Release Attempted"
  
   
 2. I9897580FY16 - The Wrong authorization provider is listed on 
                   prescription in CPRS and Outpatient Pharmacy
  
 PSPO #2696
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When finishing pending orders from CPRS using the Complete Orders from 
 OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] option, if the user selects not to display the
 patient profile and start processing pending orders a problem would occur
 for patients with orders issued by more than one single provider. If the
 user selected the Provider field (#13) and merely confirmed it,
 the prescriber would be carried over to the next pending orders for that
 same patient.
   
 Resolution: 
 -----------
 The array variable PSORX("PROVIDER NAME") that stores information about 
 the provider was not being properly initialized between the processing
 each of the patient's pending orders. The code was modified to kill the
 array variable PSORX before processing each of the patient's pending
 order.  
  
 Technical Resolution: 
 ---------------------
 Modified the routine PSOORFIN at tags SUCC+4 and PSOORFIN+19 to kill 
 array variable PSORX("PROVIDER NAME")
  
  
 3. I9898461FY16 - Comment placed in "REMARKS" prompt is not visible if Rx 
                   is on HOLD 
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Comments entered into the REMARKS field (#15) were not being displayed
 when a prescription was put on hold. Once the prescription was removed
 from hold, the remarks would become visible again.
   
 Resolution: 
 -----------
 Modified routine PSOORNE2 so the comments entered into the REMARKS field 
 (#15) display when the prescription is put on hold. 
  
 Technical Resolution: 
 ---------------------
 Modified the routine ACT+2^PSOORNE2 to set just $P(RX3,"^") instead of 
 the entire RX3 variable, as shown below:
  
 I 'RX3 S RX3=$P(RX2,"^",2),$P(^PSRX(RXN,3),"^")=$P(RX2,"^",2) 
  
  
 4. I10167818FY16 - Editing day's supply incorrect
  
 PSPO #2580 
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 For pending orders with a dispense drug where the quantity can be
 automatically calculated based on the dosage and days supply there was a
 problem for certain situations where the automatic calculation was not
 desirable. For example, the prescriber would order 10 tablets of a 
 controlled substance medication with a 30 days supply PRN (As Needed) to
 be taken no more than twice a day. When the Outpatient Pharmacy user
 edited the DAYS SUPPLY field (#8) for such order and changed it from 30 to
 28, as an example, the software would automatically update the quantity
 from 10 to 56, which is clearly inconsistent with the prescriber's initial
 intention.  
   
 Resolution: 
 -----------
 A new logic has been introduced related to the editing the DAYS SUPPLY 
 field (#8) of a pending order:
  
  1. For single dose order the software will not automatically recalculate 
     the Quantity field if the current Quantity value on the order is not
     the result of a calculation based on the current Day Supply value
     (before the edit), which suggests the Quantity was previously manually
     entered (not calculated).
  2. The software will not take into account whether the Schedule is marked
     PRN (As Needed) or not when deciding to automatically recalculate the
     QTY field (#9).
  3. For a Controlled Substance pending order the system will not 
     automatically recalculate the Quantity field (#9) if it will cause the
     current Quantity value to be increased.
  4. For a Complex Controlled Substance pending order the system will not 
     automatically recalculate the Quantity field (#9).
  5. For a pending order that qualify for a Quantity recalculation that did
     not happen because of one of the rules above (1, 3 and 4), the system
     will display the following message to the user editing the DAYS SUPPLY
     field (#8): 
     
           The QTY (99) has not been changed.  
           Please, review and update it if necessary.  
  
 Additionally, a modification was introduced to prevent any automatic
 calculation/update of the QTY field (#9) for a new, pending or existing
 order when the user selects to specifically edit the QTY field (#9)
 itself.
  
 Technical Resolution: 
 ---------------------
 Modified routines PSODIR1, PSOSIG, PSOSIGCX and PSOSIGTX to implement the 
 new rules above.
   
 5. I14933412FY17 - When editing the QTY field (#9) of a Pending Order the 
                    system will auto calculate if Schedule not marked PRN
    
 Problem: 
 --------
 When using the options Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR
 ORDERS] or Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH] if the user tries 
 to edit the QTY field (#9) of the pending order and if the quantity can be
 automatically calculated and the current value does not match the 
 calculated value the software will automatically replace the current value
 with the calculated value before prompting the user for the QTY field (#9)
 for the order.
  
 As seen on the example below:

 Resolution: 
 -----------
 A change was introduced to the code responsible for handling the editing 
 of the QTY field (#9) of a pending order to prevent any automatic
 recalculation and update of the quantity value from happening before the
 user is prompted for the QTY prompt. Also, when entering a new order the
 software will not try to auto update the QTY value if a value already is
 defined and the user is chooses to edit the QTY field (#9).
    
 Technical Resolution: 
 ---------------------
 Modified the routine PSODIR1 at the QTY line tag that handles the QTY 
 editing logic to not call QTY^PSOSIG (responsible for recalculating the
 quantity) when a quantity already exists for the order.
