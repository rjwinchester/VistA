Description:
============

  
 ***********patch PSO*7*467 must be installed before PSO*7*506**********
  
 This patch is being released as a follow-up to patch PSO*7*467 to resolve 
 the error that occurs when a user attempts to edit a drug in the validate 
 drug function of Inbound eRx. If the user selects a drug who's orderable 
 item patient instructions contains a ';', a hard error occurs and the 
 user is kicked out of the system. This patch is to be released 
 immediately following patch PSO*7*467. Routines PSOERXD2 and PSOERX1B have
 been modified to use the FILE^DIE call rather than the regular ^DIE call.

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 N/A
  
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
   
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSO*7.0*506 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PS0*7.0*506 in
 the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997;Build 4

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.

Routine Name: PSOERX1B
