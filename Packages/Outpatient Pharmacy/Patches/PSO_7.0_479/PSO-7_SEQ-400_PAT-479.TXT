 Defect Tracking System Tickets Overview:
 ========================================
  
 I11926603FY17 - CA SDM,  469972 - Rational Defect
  
 User Attempts to ^ at the Device Prompt, the fill is still processed
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When processing a OneVA Pharmacy refill or partial and an ^ is
 entered at the DEVICE: prompt, the user may assume that the refill
 or partial has been aborted.  However, at this point, the refill
 or partial has already been processed and saved. The user is exited
 from printing a label with no warning message and there is no way to
 request a reprint of the label.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine PSORRX2 to add the following text if no error message
 is returned when retrieving the label info from the host system.
 This text will be displayed just prior to the 'LABEL DEVICE:' prompt.
 (nnnn is the Prescription number)
  
 For a Partial fill: 
 TRANSACTION SUCCESSFUL.  The partial for RX #nnnn has been recorded
 on the prescription at the host system. 
  
 Select a printer to generate the label or '^' to bypass printing.
  
 For a Refill:
 TRANSACTION SUCCESSFUL.  The refill for RX #nnnn has been recorded
 on the prescription at the host system. 
  
 Select a printer to generate the label or '^' to bypass printing.

 IMPORTANT: Patch PSO*7*479 does not address all of the reasons
 why the OneVA Pharmacy software is currently disabled at your
 facility.  Sites are instructed to INSTALL this patch by the
 listed compliance date.
  
 Do NOT turn the OneVA Pharmacy functionality on until given
 explicit instruction to do so.
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 Patients should not be processing remote prescriptions while patch
 is being installed.  It should take less than 2 minutes to install this
 patch.
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the
       INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
   
    3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSO*7.0*479)
   
         a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
             transport global.
         b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
             the components of the KIDS build.
         c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when this 
             patch
             is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
             (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
         d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
             message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
             backup any other changes such as DDs or templates. The backup
             transport global will allow a rollback to the prior version of
             the routines released in this patch in the event a rollback is
             required.  
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
       PSO*7.0*479.
  
    5. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//", respond NO.  
   
    6. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//", respond NO.
  
 Installation Verification
 =========================
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;DEC 1997;Build 349 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
 Back-out Procedures
 ===================
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System. 
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 =================================
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSO*7.0*479 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSO*7.0*479 in
 the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997;Build 2

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.

Routine Name: PSORRX2
    Before: B32510176   After: B34725424  **454,479**
 
Routine list of preceding patches: 454
