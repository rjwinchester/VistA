      ------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   PLEASE NOTE
  
            THIS PATCH IS PART OF THE EPIP_PSO_PSS_IP21.KID HOST FILE
            WHICH CONSISTS OF PSO*7.0*452 AND PSS*1.0*215. THE PSO PATCH
            WILL BE INSTALLED BEFORE THE PSS PATCH.
  
       ------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 PSO*7.0*452 provides the following enhancements to VistA:
  
 - Enhances the High Cost Rx Report [PSO HI COST] option to list a site's 
 OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) entries. This enables users to select any 
 combination of available Outpatient Pharmacy sites so that only 
 information from those sites is included in the report. After specifying a
 Date Range and Dollar Limit, the new prompt "For RXs written at OUTPATIENT
 SITES(s): (Example 1,3 or 1-5)" displays. A list of active sites is
 retrieved from the OUTPATIENT SITE file and displays as a numbered list.
 The user can select one, some, or all sites to be included in the report.
 For example, a multi-divisional facility with five active outpatient sites
 could create the report for one site by typing the assigned site number
 (e.g., "3"), for multiple sites by typing the corresponding site numbers
 separated by a comma (e.g., "1,3,5"), or for all sites by typing the range
 "1-5."
  
 A new header, "Outpatient Site(s) Included in this Report," is added to 
 the top of the report. The header displays a list of the site(s) included 
 in the report. This modification eliminates the need for multi-divisional 
 sites to manually identify the prescriptions associated with each pharmacy
 location, thus reducing effort and potential errors.
  
 - Enables Outpatient Pharmacy Services to print suspended prescription 
 labels by category when using the Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] 
 option. The new prompt "Select Print Category: (A/N/C/S/R/D/V/E): ALL//" 
 allows users to specify the prescription labels to be printed from the RX 
 SUSPENSE file (#52.5) by selecting from the categories All (A),
 Non-Controlled Drugs (N), Controlled Substances (C), Supplies (S),
 Refrigerated Items (R), Drugs (D), and VA Classifications (V). To leave 
 the prompt without choosing a print category, select Exit (E). Type "?" at
 the prompt to display help text describing the available print categories.
  
 The existing option to print all labels is still available. When the new 
 prompt displays, accepting the default value "ALL" prints all labels in 
 the Suspense File using existing functionality and prompts. A variety of 
 new and existing prompts follow. Extra help text is added to the 
 Refrigerated and Supplies prompts to clarify expected results when using 
 the Include or Exclude functionality.
  
 - Modifies the VistA Outpatient Pharmacy System to send an early warning 
 message to a new PHARMACY SUPERVISORS MailMan group, notifying recipients 
 that one or more active Outpatient Pharmacy sites in a multi-divisional 
 facility are approaching the upper limit of the defined prescription 
 numbering series. Each pharmacy site uses a prescription numbering series 
 unique to that site. The new warning is intended to prevent an 
 unintentional shutdown of prescription processing that will occur if the 
 pharmacy reaches the upper limit of the numbering series. When the last 
 number in the defined range is assigned to an order, all Outpatient 
 Pharmacy prescription processing stops until a new range of numbers is 
 defined by a Pharmacy Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator 
 (ADPAC) or Pharmacy Informaticist.
  
 This enhancement adds the new PSO RX Numbering Warning [PSO RX NUMBERING 
 WARNING] option. The post-installation routine PSOP452P creates the new 
 PHARMACY SUPERVISORS mail group and schedules the PSO RX Numbering Warning
 option to run a nightly job at 03:01. This nightly job runs the new
 routine PSOEOPNW, which searches the prescription number ranges for all
 active sites in the OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59) and generates a MailMan
 message to the PHARMACY SUPERVISORS group when a new range must be
 defined. The mail group must be populated with the recipients responsible
 for modifying the range at each active Outpatient Pharmacy site.
  
 By default, the warning message is sent when there are 1000 prescription 
 numbers left in a range. The warning will be sent each time the nightly 
 job runs and less than 1000 numbers remain in the defined range. The first
 warning can be customized for each site using the new RX# UPPER BOUND
 WARNING LIMIT field (#48) added to the Pharmacy System file (#59.7) by
 companion patch PSS*1.0*215. The upper-limit value stored in this field
 determines when the system sends an early warning message. If no custom
 value is entered, then the default value is used.
  
 Most VA facilities use separate numbering systems for Narcotic and 
 non-Narcotic medications. If Narcotics are numbered separately, then the 
 warning will include information about the upper limit for Narcotics. If 
 Narcotics are not numbered separately, then they are grouped with 
 non-Narcotic medications. Information specific to Narcotics numbering is 
 only tracked and displayed if Narcotics are numbered separately.
  
 - Enhances the patient demographic information displayed when using 
 certain Pharmacy options. The new patient demographic details include the 
 patient's primary care team and/or physician, physician contact numbers 
 (phone/pager), clinician remarks, and assigned or recent facility where 
 care is recieved. The additional patient demographic information is 
 preceded by the header "Extended Patient Demographics." These demographic
 details are retrieved from existing patient information in VistA and added
 to the demographic information currently displayed when using any of the
 following options: Medication Profile [PSO P], View Prescriptions [PSO
 VIEW], Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS], and
 Complete Orders from OERR [PSO LMOE FINISH].
  
 This enhancement also adds a new Clinical Alert to highlight important 
 care information relevant to the patient. Pharmacy Supervisors can use the
 new Clinical Alert Enter/Edit [PSO CLINICAL ALERT ENTER/EDIT] option to
 make Pharmacy staff aware of information such as drug interactions or the
 patient's participation in clinical trials. When a Pharmacy Supervisor
 enters a Clinical Alert, the Alert text is prominently displayed with
 other patient demographic information when Pharmacy staff use any of the
 aforementioned Outpatient Pharmacy [PSO] options to process and dispense
 outpatient medications.

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 The post-installation routine PSOP452P runs automatically at the end of 
 the installation. This routine creates the PHARMACY SUPERVISORS mail group
 and schedules the PSO RX NUMBERING WARNING option to run a nightly job at
 03:01 daily.
  
 This nightly job runs the new PSOEOPNW routine, which searches 
 prescription number ranges for active sites in the OUTPATIENT SITE file 
 (#59) and sends a warning message to the new mail group when a new range 
 must be defined. The PHARMACY SUPERVISORS mail group is created without 
 any members and must be populated with appropriate recipients for each 
 site.
  
 The post-installation routine is automatically deleted when installation 
 completes.
  
  
 Backout Procedure: 
 ------------------ 
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of the multi-patch build that includes this 
 patch, it is not recommended for backout, and a restore from a backup of 
 the Transport Global should not be attempted. However, in the event that a
 site decides to back out the primary and/or companion patches included in
 the host file, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to
 submit a help desk ticket. The development team will need to issue one or 
 more follow-on patches in order to comprehensively complete the backout, 
 after coordination with the VA Project Manager and COR.
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure: 
 -------------------------------- 
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the PSO routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the PSO routines have been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain 
 the designation of patch PSO*7.0*452 on line 2 in the patch list section.
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out for this patch. It does not confirm that routine changes 
 within other patches in the multi-patch build have been backed out. It 
 also does not confirm that component changes other than routines have 
 been backed out.
