Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements that extend the capabilities of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                       PSO*7*427
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                        IB*2*534
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0     BPS*1*19
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0   PSX*2*77
    PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT (PDM) V. 1.0                 PSS*1*188
  
 Patches PSX*2*77 and PSS*1*188 are being released as stand-alone patches,
 while the other three patches (PSO*7*427, IB*2*534, BPS*1*19) are being
 released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
 multi-build distribution BPS PSO IB BUNDLE 6.0.  The two stand-alone 
 patches and multi-build distribution can be installed in any order and 
 do not need to installed at the same time.
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 1.  A new section "OTHER REJECTS PENDING RESOLUTION" was added to the
     Medication Profile screen.  This section includes prescriptions that
     have at least one unresolved reject of the following types: Reject
     Resolution Required rejects, any TRICARE eligibility rejects 
     (including eT), or any CHAMPVA eligibility rejects (including eC).
  
 2.  Edit Prescription screen will always display the National Drug Code
     (NDC) field and number.
  
 3.  Edit Prescription screen allows an edit to the NDC number if the
     prescription has been released or if the prescription has an open
     reject for a billable claim, regardless of patient eligibility.  Edit
     to the NDC number is not allowed if the prescription is unreleased or
     there are no open rejects for the claim.  Pseudo-reject codes of eT
     and eC will be excluded from edit if the prescription is unreleased.
  
 4.  View Prescription screen will always display the NDC field and number
     for the original fill.
  
 5.  View Prescription screen will always display the NDC field and number
     in the Refill Log.
  
 6.  The Reject Information screen of the Third Party Payer Rejects -
     View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] and Third Party Payer Rejects 
     - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] options was modified to include the
     hidden action Discontinue Rx [DC] for veteran prescriptions.
  
 7.  The Reject Information screen of the Third Party Payer Rejects -
     View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] and Third Party Payer Rejects 
     - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] options was modified so that any
     action that causes an ePharmacy claim submission will include a pause
     at the end of ePharmacy submission messaging.  This will allow the
     pharmacist to read the message before the screen goes back to the
     Reject Information screen.  The length of the pause can be configured
     by the site using the ePharmacy Site Parameters [PSO ePHARM SITE
     PARAMETERS] option.
  
 8.  The Reject Information screen of the Third Party Payer Rejects - 
     View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] and Third Party Payer Rejects 
     - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] options was modified so that the
     Edit Rx [ED] action will place the prescription on the list of
     prescriptions that will get the 'LABEL: QUEUE/CHANGE 
     PRINTER/HOLD/SUSPEND or '^' to bypass//' prompt if the Fill Date is
     equal to the current date or is in the future even if the Fill Date
     was not modified by the user.  This will give the pharmacist the
     opportunity to suspend the prescription.
  
 9.  The Third Party Payer Rejects - View/Process [PSO REJECTS 
     VIEW/PROCESS] and Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS
     WORKLIST] options were modified to include a new action called Print
     to Excel [PSX].  This action will output the list of rejected
     prescriptions in a format that can be pasted into an Excel
     spreadsheet.
  
 10. The INSURANCE COMPANY NAME prompt on the Third Party Payer Rejects
     - View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] option was modified to 
     allow a true lookup of insurance companies in the INSURANCE COMPANY
     (#36) file.  This will allow for better matching of the user input to
     the data.
  
 11. The Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] option was modified to 
     prevent a label from reprinting and to remove the prescription from
     Suspense if the label log shows the label has printed before, unless
     the suspense queue indicates that a user has previously requested a
     reprint of the suspended prescription.  Similarly, the Pull Early
     from Suspense [PSO PNDRX] option and the Pull Rx (OP) [PP] actions on
     the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option
     will have the same functionality except that these options/actions
     will prompt the user whether they want to reprint a label or not.
  
 12. The text of the ePharmacy - OPEN/UNRESOLVED REJECTS LIST bulletin was
     modified to be more accurate.  It was also modified so that 
     prescriptions listed in the bulletin are separated into prescription
     categories similar to what is used by the Reject Information screen
     of the Third Party Payer Rejects - View/Process [PSO REJECTS
     VIEW/PROCESS] and Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS
     WORKLIST] options.  Those users needing access to this information 
     will need to be added to the PSO REJECTS BACKGROUND MESSAGE Mail 
     Group.
  
 13. The TRICARE CHAMPVA Bypass/Override Report [PSO TRI CVA OVERRIDE 
     REPORT] option was modified to change the text of one of the Audit
     Type categories from 'NON-BILLABLE PRODUCT' to 'NON-BILLABLE'.  This
     impacted the user lookup and the display of the report itself.
   
 14. Some background processing within Outpatient Pharmacy was modified so
     that TRICARE/CHAMPVA claims with Environmental Indicators can be 
     filled but not billed to the third party insurance.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named PSO427PS.
 The purpose of the post install routine is to:
  
  a. Removes the cached version of the PSO REJECT DISPLAY HIDDEN MENU
     and PSO REJECTS HIDDEN ACTIONS #1 option menus.
  
  b. Populates the INSURANCE COMPANY (#33) field of the REJECT INFO
     (#52.25) subfile of the PRESCRIPTION (#52) file. Depending on the 
     number of records in the file, this process may take some time to run
     so this part of the post-install will be queued to run as a background
     task. A mail message will be sent indicating the results of the
     post-install process.
  
 You may delete routine PSO427PS if the installation was successful and 
 the mailman message indicates that the post-install was successful.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed during non-peak
 hours when there is minimal activity on the system. Avoid times when ECME
 claims are being transmitted. Of particular concern are the options below.
  
     1. BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB]
        Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
        by the BPS Nightly Background Job option. Wait for this job to
        finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
  
     2. Scheduled CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED CS TRANS] and
        Scheduled Non-CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED NON-CS TRANS]
        Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
        transmitted to CMOP. Wait for the CMOP transmissions to finish
        or complete the installation before the transmissions start. Both
        the CS (Controlled Substances) and the non-CS CMOP transmission
        options should be checked. Check with Pharmacy Service or your
        Pharmacy ADPAC to find out when CMOP transmissions occur.
  
 This multi-build installation should take less than 5 minutes to install.
  
 This multi-build installation can be queued but should not be queued at a 
 time when the BPS NIGHTY BACKGROUND JOB or CMOP transmission processes
 are scheduled.

     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not
         backup any other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, data dictionaries, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
