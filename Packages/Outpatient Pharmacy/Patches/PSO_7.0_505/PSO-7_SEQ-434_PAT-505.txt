Subject: MEDICATION PERMISSIONS/DISPENSING UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Outpatient pharmacy is being enhanced to provide new and updated 
 functionality. Certain fields in controlled substance prescriptions can 
 no longer be edited (such as Provider, Orderable Item, and Drug). 
 Controlled substance prescriptions will now require the patient to have 
 a zip code on file in order for the order to be written or dispensed 
 through the 'Patient Prescription Processing' option [PSO LM BACKDOOR] or 
 the 'Complete Orders from OERR option [PSO LMOE FINISH]. 
 Titration/Maintenance functionality is now being blocked for all 
 controlled substance prescriptions. Outpatient pharmacy now allows 
 leading zeros in fractional quantity prescriptions, allowing users to
 accurately dispense outpatient medications.
  
 New sorting/filtering criteria have been added to 'Complete Orders from 
 OERR' [PSO LMOE FINISH] to allow pharmacist more flexibility in 
 selecting the prescriptions they wish to finish. These changes will 
 improve efficiency during the process of finishing prescriptions. A new 
 secondary sort criteria is being introduced, allowing another level of 
 restriction on the list of prescriptions being provided to the user. Two 
 new options within controlled substance sorting have been added as well. 
 These are NON-CS + SCHEDULES III-IV, and NON-CS. Supply item sorting has 
 also been incorporated into the sort/filter process.
  
 The current email generated from the scheduled option 'Expire 
 Prescriptions' [PSO EXPIRE PRESCRIPTIONS] has been modified to a new 
 format to include the facility name/institution file internal entry 
 number. This is being done to provide better information to the user 
 receiving the email.
  
 Finally, the HL7 logic has been modified so that 'EL' for Electronic will 
 be sent to the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) if a
 controlled substance prescription has been digitally signed. This 
 enhancement provides the authorization type in the ORC segment allowing 
 the dispensing device to consume the authorization type. The dispensing 
 device can then make use of the authorization type to inform the 
 pharmacist whether or not a hard-copy prescription needs to be collated 
 with the medication.

 New Service Requests (NSRs):
 ----------------------------  
 NSR #20130711
  
 Item #1:
 --------
 Prevent the use of titration/maintenance functionality on all controlled
 substance prescriptions, so it is consistent between Electronic 
 Prescriptions for Controlled Substances (EPCS) prescriptions and paper
 prescriptions.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSOOTMRX has been modified to check and prevent the use of the
 titration functionality on all controlled substance prescriptions.
  
 Item #2:
 --------
 Enhance outpatient pharmacy to allow leading zeros in fractional 
 quantity prescriptions. This will allow users to finish and dispense
 outpatient medications accurately.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified PSODIR1 to add a 0 (zero) in front of the decimal place for 
 fractional quantity prescriptions.
  
 Added logic to NFILE^PSON52 to ensure a leading zero is attached to 
 fractional quantity prescriptions.
  
 Modified PSOORNEW to remove the + from the quantity display so leading 
 zeros will display for fractional quantity prescriptions.
  
 Item #3:
 --------
 Enhance messaging to the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface
 (OPAI) to include an indicator if a prescription was digitally signed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSOHLDS4 has been modified to pass 'EL' in the ORC | 30 segment 
 if the prescription is a controlled substance and has been digitally 
 signed.
  
 Item #4:
 --------
 Modify the edit logic for pending Schedule II-V orders to stop the editing
 process if one of the fields in the selection range is an uneditable
 field that would create a new prescription.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSOOREDT and PSOORNEW have been modified to check each 
 individual field when being edited. If the field is an uneditable field 
 for a controlled substance prescription, those fields will not be 
 available to the user during their editing.
  
 Item #5:
 --------
 Add legend drugs (non-controlled substances) and controlled substances
 C-III through C-V (the lower schedules of controlled substances) to the
 sort filter functionality in 'Complete Orders from OERR' [PSO LMOE
 FINISH].
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSOORFI5 has been modified to now include legend drugs and 
 controlled substances C-III through C-V and non-controlled substances.
  
 Item #6:
 --------
 Add the ability to select supply items as a sort filter in 'Complete 
 Orders from OERR' [PSO LMOE FINISH].
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Enhanced the filter selection prompt in PSOORFIN to now include supply
 items.
  
 Enhanced help text in ST^PSOORFI1 to include supply items.
  
 Added a new linetag to PSOORFI5 that controlls processing of supply items.
  
 Item #7:
 --------
 Add a secondary sort filter selection in 'Complete Orders from OERR'
 [PSO LMOE FINISH].
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSOORFIN, PSOORFI5, PSOORFI3, and PSOORFI6 have been modified to 
 now allow a user to select a primary and a secondary sort criteria. After 
 selecting a primary sort criteria, the user will not be able to select 
 the same criteria as the secondary sort.
  
 Item #8:
 --------
 Prevent users from dispensing controlled substance medications if the
 patient is missing a zip code in the patient address information.
 DEA regulation 21 CFR 1306.05(a) compliance.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSOORNEW has been modified to block the Finish action when 
 finishing a prescription that is a controlled substance when the patient 
 does not have zip code on file.
  
 Item #9:
 --------
 Modify the subject and body of the expiring DEA mail message so the
 user has more comprehensive information about an expriring DEA number.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine PSOHLEXP to update the subject and body of the email 
 message being sent.

 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch 
     PSO*7*505.
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  Select the installation option Backup a Transport Global. This 
     option will create a backup message of any routines exported with 
     this patch in case you need to backout this patch. It will not backup
     any other changes such as Data Dictionaries (DD's) or templates. It 
     is important this step be followed, because if backout of this patch 
     is necessary, having the backup will make the process much easier.
  
 5.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//', answer 'NO'.

 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
  
 Back-out Procedures are only needed if there are major problems (examples 
 include the KIDS notice of incompletion or hard errors) resulting from the
 installation of this patch. You must have concurrence from Health Product
 Support before a rollback can occur. Enter a ServiceNow helpdesk ticket 
 to obtain this concurrence.
  
 Prior to installing a patch, the site/region should have saved a backup 
 of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport Global 
 [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install). The message 
 containing the backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" 
 function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function 
 "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up routines 
 onto the VistA System.
   
   
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
  
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the 
 PSO*7.0*505 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSO*7.0*505 in 
 the patch list section on line 2.
