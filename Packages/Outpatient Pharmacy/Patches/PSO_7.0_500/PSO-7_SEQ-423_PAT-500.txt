Subject: MOCHA 2.1B FOLLOW UP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Medication Order Check HealthCare Application (MOCHA) 2.1B patches 
 implement Max Daily Dose Order Checks for simple medication orders 
 entered through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), Inpatient 
 Medications and Outpatient Pharmacy. If the Daily Dose exceeds the First 
 Databank (FDB) recommended Max Daily Dose, a warning shall be displayed 
 to the user. If the Max Daily Dose Order Check cannot be performed, an 
 error message will be displayed to the user, along with general dosing 
 information for the drug in most cases.
  
 This patch is part of the MOCHA Enhancements 2.1B group of builds and is a
 component of the last group installed. Multiple package host files were
 created where possible to simplify installation at Veterans Health
 Administration (VHA) facilities. The combined build host file
 MOCHA_2_1_PSO_OR_PSJ.KID contains OR*3.0*382, PSJ*5.0*256 and PSO*7.0*402.
 The combined follow up host file MOCHA_2_1_FOLLOW_UP_PSO_OR_PSJ.KID
 contains this patch as well as OR*3.0*469 and PSJ*5.0*347. In addition,
 there are standalone Pharmacy Data Management patches, PSS*1.0*178 and
 PSS*1.0*206, which must be installed in conjunction with the other builds.
  
                               * * * Notice * * *
                   This group of patches should not be installed 
                       until the follow on patch PSO*7.0*515
            has been released and is ready to be immediately installed. 
                PSO*7.0*515 must be installed immediately after the
                  successful installation of this group of builds.
               See the PSO*7.0*515 patch description for details.
                               * * * Notice * * *  
  
 MOCHA v2.1B will provide the following enhancements:
 ===================================================
  
 Implement Dose Range Checking with a Max Daily Dose limit for 
 simple medication orders entered through Outpatient Pharmacy, Inpatient 
 Medications applications and CPRS.

 Check cannot be performed in CPRS.

 patient.
  
 Display an error message when the Max Daily Dose Order Check 
 cannot be performed in Pharmacy with a detailed reason.

 dosing check frequency fields.
  
 Apply Daily Dose Check exclusion for schedule to medication 
 orders entered through Outpatient Pharmacy, Inpatient Medications and

 Guidelines for medication administered through eye, ear, or nose.
  
 Create a customized frequency message.
  
 Create a general dosing information message.

 Add FDB data elements from Dosing Order Check call to VistA side of
 interface.

 Adjustment to the Daily Dose if a Single Dose Adjustment is made for an IV
 order when performing Dosing Order Checks.
  
 Modify entries to the DOSE UNITS file (#51.24).
  
 Modify entries to the DOSE UNIT CONVERSION file (#51.25).

 I5589877FY15 - Make Metric Conversions for Patient Weight Consistent
                across VistA Packages      
  
   Problem:
   --------
   In order to display the patient's weight in Kilograms (Kgs) the current
   conversion from Pounds (Lbs) to Kgs is being done by dividing the 
   patient weight on file by 2.2. 
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The weight calculation conversion from Lbs to Kgs is being modified to
   increase the precision of the patient weight in Kgs by dividing it by
   2.2046226 instead. This change will make the Outpatient Pharmacy
   consistent with Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).
  
   Technical Resolution:
   ---------------------
   Modify routines to calculate from pounds to kilograms to use 2.2046226 
   lbs/kg instead of 2.2 lbs/kg.

 ****************************** NOTE ************************************
 The 'Before' checksum values for routines PSOBKDE1, PSODEM, PSODOSUN,
 PSOORED5, PSOORUT2, PSORXEDT, PSOSIG, and PSOVER1 in this patch will
 appear incorrect.  This is because they are components of the preceding
 patch PSO*7.0*402 which is also part of the MOCHA 2.1B group of builds.  
 The FORUM Patch Module uses released checksum values to populate the
 'Before' fields below.  Since PSO*7.0*402 will be released at the same
 time as this patch the FORUM Patch Module does not have access to the
 actual 'Before' checksum values.
