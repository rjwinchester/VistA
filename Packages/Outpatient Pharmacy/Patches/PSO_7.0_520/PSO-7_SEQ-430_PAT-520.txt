 Defect: 466698
 --------------
 Facility segment data and the payer name value included in the benefits 
 coordination segment of the incoming XML message are not being filed
 into the ERX HOLDING QUEUE file (#52.49).

 payer name data and facility data into the appropriate fields in the ERX
 HOLDING QUEUE file (#52.49).

 will convert all lower-case responses to an upper-case format before
 filing the entry into File Manager.
  
 Defect: 596352
 --------------
 The eRx holding queue display, eRx patient validation screen, and the 
 print screen are not displaying the full 107 characters of the eRx patient
 name.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSOERXP1, PSOERX1, and PSOERX1C have been modified so that the 
 eRx holding queue display, eRx patient validation screen, and the print
 screen will all display the full 107 characters for the eRx patient name.
  
 Defect: 600269
 --------------
 Currently, the print screen does not display the prescriber's telephone
 number, fax number, agent first name, agent last name, agent middle name,

 for the NPI and DEA number.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------

 --------------
 The software is asking to validate prescriptions that have already been

 validation procedure on eRx prescriptions that have already been
 processed.
  
 Defect: 684353
 --------------
 When a user is working on an eRx that does not have a refill value, the
 'Refills:' display is always blank. This needs to be changed to display
 the refill qualifier in the event refills are blank.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSOERX1, PSOERX1C, PSOERXD1, and PSOERXU1 have been modified to
 first check the refill value. If no refill value is found, the display
 will utilize the refill qualifier so the user is made fully aware of the
 physicians intent for the prescription.
  
 Defect: 601026
 --------------
 When a user is validating a drug in the drug validation process, the 
 quantity, days supply, and refill algorithms are not being used to
 restrict the number of refills possible for the current medication.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified PSOERXD2 and added QTYDSRFL^PSOERXU4 to properly invoke the logic
 currently being used in the edit of prescriptions in outpatient pharmacy.
 This will provide consistency and accuracy when editing the quantity, days
 supply, and refill values.
  
 Defect: 619348
 --------------
 The NPI and state license number fields overlap on the provider 
 validation screen. There is no space between them to create separation.

 city on separate lines.
  
 Defect: 702742
 --------------
 When validating a drug and using a free text dosage, it has been found 
 that scenarios exist which populate the QUANTITY/FORM (#.01) field of the
 ERX HOLDING QUEUE sub-file QUANTITY/TIMING (#52.4921) With the "&"
 character.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 PSOERXD2 has been modified to utilize an existing variable, P01,
 instead of a separate calculation. During review it was determined the
 variable P01 contains the information needed by the QUANTITY/FORM (#.01)
 field of the ERX HOLDING QUEUE QUANTITY/TIMING sub-file (#52.4921).
  
 A post installation routine, PSO520PO, has been created to identify and
 repair all entries in the PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file (#52.41) and ERX
 HOLDING QUEUE sub-file QUANTITY/TIMING (#59.4921).
  
 Defect: 708087
 --------------
 An undefined error is occurring in routine PSOERXA1 when the variable 
 PNAME is not populated by the incoming XML message.

 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
  
 Back-out Procedures are only needed if there are major problems (examples 
 include KIDS notice of incompletion or hard errors) resulting from the 
 installation of this patch. You must have concurrence from  Health 
 Product Support before a rollback can occur. Enter a CA helpdesk ticket 
 to obtain this concurrence.
  
 Prior to installing a patch, the site/region should have saved a backup 
 of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport Global 
 [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install). The message 
 containing the backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" 
 function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function 
 "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up routines 
 onto the VistA System.
