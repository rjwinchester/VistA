Subject: INCORRECT DRUG ON OneVA Rx LABEL

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following two issues:
  
 1. Incorrect drug on label for OneVA refill request
 2. OneVA prescription error
  
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 -----------------------------
 HITPS-6386 - INC2091135/INC3288670
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC2091135 - Incorrect drug on label for OneVA refill request
    INC3288670 - OneVA prescription error.  Drug does not match Rx
    (Duplicate)  number from facility that Rx was transferred to
                 Phoenix from.
     
 Problem: 
 --------
 A pharmacist refilled a OneVA Rx and verified the correct local drug 
 matched to the remote site drug. 
 The labels printed with a different drug that was on the patient's 
 profile. This happened with 5 prescriptions. Some did print correct. 
 Partials were done and some came through in the same erroneous way.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Resolve this with the following:
 - A 3 second hang will be added prior to reading the HL7 response
 with the label information from the Host site
 - Once the HL7 message is read, the Rx number selected at the
 Remote site will be compared to the Rx number returned in the HL7 label
 message from the Host site and if this is a match, processing will
 continue as normal
 - If the two Rx's do not match, the message below will be displayed
 and processing will cease 
    'Label interrupted due to HL7 message corruption.'
    'Please request a Partial Fill in order to generate a reprint label.'
 - In the background, invisible to the user, an error trap entry
 will be made so more research can be done to find the root cause of this
 happening.  The error in the error trap will show as 'MISMATCH RX'
 Modify the following routines: PSORRX2, PSORWRAP 
  
 2. INC2394703 - OneVA prescription error
            
 Problem: 
 --------
 The Saginaw VA Medical Center reported that a OneVA prescription fill
 request appears to have prompted ScripTalk label to print at host site. The
 Host site requeued Vista label and it appears prescription was filled twice.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The OneVA Pharmacy functionality did not prevent a ScripTalk label from
 printing at the host site when a refill/partial was requested by the patient
 at a remote site. A fix is being introduced by this patch to prevent the
 ScripTalk label from printing at the host site when a OneVA prescription
 refill/partial is requested is filed.
     
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed the routine PSORWRAP to set the variable PSOONEVA before calling the
 label printing routines (DQ^PSOLBL) and then changed the routine PSOTALK to
 QUIT if the label being printed is a OneVA Pharmacy label at the remote site.
  
 **********NOTE**********
 OneVA Pharmacy does not interface with ScripTalk prescription label 
 printing. Consider an alternative process and workflow. Sites may need to 
 confirm veteran's need, implement a standard evaluation process, and the 
 veteran's cognitive and physical ability.

 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  Staff should not be processing 
 prescriptions while patch is being installed.  This patch should take 
 less than 5 minutes to install.
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
    2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  From this menu, you may select to use the
       following options: 
       when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the patch # PSO*7.0*541:
  
         a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch 
            routines, DDs, templates, etc.
  
         c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
  
    4. From the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
       choose the patch to install.
  
    5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', respond NO.
  
    6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
    7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first
 2 lines of the routines contained in the patch. The second line
 will contain the patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;DEC 1997;Build 349 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] 
 can be run to compare the routine checksums to what is documented
 in the patch description.
  
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation
 of development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision
 between development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should
 have saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the
 Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at
 time of install). The message containing the backed up routines can
 be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action
 prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used
 to install the backed up routines onto the VistA System. 
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2
 lines of the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option
 First Line Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines
 contained in the PSO*7.0*541 patch have been rolled back, the first
 two lines of the Routines will no longer contain the designation
 of patch PSO*7.0*541 in the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[Patch List]**;DEC 1997;Build 14

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.
