Subject: PENDING REFILL/REPRINT DESIGNATION/INCORRECT DATA IN CPRS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch resolves the following three issues:
  
 1) The maximum number of refills displayed for a pending order is incorrect.
     
 2) The word REPRINT incorrectly displays on a label and label log when using
    the following option: Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL]
  
 3) The detailed display for an IV order in CPRS also shows information for a
    different prescription.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) INC000000271316  When editing a pending order's refills, the RX PATIENT
                     STATUS is not taken into account.
  
   
 Problem:
 --------
 For a pending order, Rx Patient Status is not used to determine the maximum
 number of refills allowed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify processing to check the RX PATIENT STATUS to determine the maximum
 number of refills allowed.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routine PSODIR3
  
  
 2) INC000000275878  Print From Suspense and Labels
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the Print from Suspense File option [PSO PNDLBL] the word
 REPRINT prints on the label and displays in the label log. This is
 incorrect, the initial print is not a reprint.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify processing so that the word REPRINT does not display on the label or
 print log for the initial print from suspense.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 The variable REPRINT is used as a flag to determine if the label being printed
 is a reprint. The current code uses the $D function to test the flag. In this
 instance, the $G function should be used. Will change the $D to a $G to check
 for the value of the REPRINT variable.
  
  
 3) INC000000737285  New IV order associated with 1992  prescription data        
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In CPRS, the detail display for an inpatient IV prescription contains
 information that does not match the prescription being viewed. This is
 because some of the data used to build the display is mistakenly processed
 as an outpatient prescription.  This data is called the "package reference".
  
 The package reference data for an IV is alpha numeric.  i.e. 1V,2V,3V
 The number represents the number of IVs ordered for a patient.  If a patient
 has had 3 IV orders, then the package reference for the 3rd prescription is 3V.
 During processing VistA is dropping the alpha character leaving only a numeric
 value.  This value is treated as an internal entry number for an outpatient
 prescription. As a result, information showing in the "dispense drugs" section 
 of the detailed display does not match previously displayed information.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify processing so the detail display for an IV order does not contain
 information that belongs to another prescription.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routine PSOORRL
  
 Please review the example below.
 a. The prescription ordered is DEXTROSE 50% INJ,SOLN.
 b. The "dispense drugs" section displays LACTASE 3000 UNT TAB
