                    and medication instructions are entered into Other

 PSPO #2270
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The medication instructions appear to be missing from the prescription
 label when the Other Language Preference switch is set to Yes and the
 user enters instructions in only one of two possible fields, Patient
 Instructions or Other Patient Instructions.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify functionality so if the patient has Other Language Preference set 
 to Yes, then Patient Instructions and Other Patient Instructions are
 either both populated or both blank. Routines PSODIR, PSOHELP3, PSONEW1, 
 PSOORED1, PSOORNE1, PSOORNW2 are being modified.
  
 2.  I9882312FY16 - Duplicate Prescriptions are active on a patient's 
                    profile
  
 PSPO #868
 PSPO #2242
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Two prescriptions are staying Active on patient's profile
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify processing so the Duplicate Order check is performed when the 
 Dispense Drug is edited on an Active prescription.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify CT1+11^PSOORNW1 -

 3. I9884924FY16 - Pharmacy staff can process their own prescriptions  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Using menu option Edit Prescriptions [PSO RXEDIT], users can edit their 
 own prescriptions.  A user accessing one's own prescription is a violation
 of VHA guidelines.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Menu option Edit Prescriptions [PSO RXEDIT] will be modified so users 
 will no longer be able to process their own prescriptions.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Need to modify routines PR^PSORXPR, CHK+8^PSODPT, PT+7^PSORXEDT and
 EDIT^PSOVER1.
 Add call to $$CHK^PSOPT(DFN,1,1), quit if return value=-1
  
 4. I9883609FY16 - When editing the Drug on a Prescription and answering 
                   NO to Edit the SIG prompt, the Dosage is not updated to
                   match the Drug and SIG.
  
    I14605157FY17 - Duplicate
  
 PSPO #3573
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When editing the Drug on a Prescription and answering NO to edit the SIG
 prompt, the Dosage is not updated to match the Drug and SIG.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify processing so the user is no longer prompted YES/NO to edit the SIG
 if the Drug is edited.  This will cause the user to edit the Dosage which
 will update the Dosage to match the Drug and SIG.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routines 6^PSODRGN, DRG^PSOORED6, PSOI^PSOORED6, 1^PSOORNE1,
 2^PSOORNW1 and DT1^PSOORNW1 so the user is no longer prompted to edit
 the SIG and they are automatically taken into editing the data.
