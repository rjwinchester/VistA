Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues:
  
 1. I15848129FY17 - Buprenorphine/naloxone prescription went through when
                    the DEA expiration date was in the past 
  
 2. R16854127FY18 - FILL DATE prompt range incorrect
  
 3. I5855290FY15  - CK Hidden Option and Remote Order Checks
     
 4. I17185111FY18 - Error when changing routing from Window to Mail
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. I15848129FY17 - Buprenorphine/naloxone prescription went through when
                    the DEA expiration date was in the past 
    
 Problem:
 --------
 The following 6 issues have been reported regarding the DEA and DETOX number 
 functionality.
 a. A detox Rx with a provider with an expired DEA/DETOX number can be
    renewed
 b. A detox Rx with a provider with an expired DEA/DETOX number can be
    copied
 c. When speed renewing a detox Rx, any provider can be selected.
 d. When speed renewing a detox Rx, the maximum refills prompt is not
    restricted by the drug special handling, i.e. maximum refills is 11.
 e. If a provider has an expired DEA number but has a VA number and the
    institution DEA number is not expired, then the provider may be selected
    for detox Rx's.  This seems to contradict the description in PSO*7*391
    item 16.  
 f. If a provider with an expired DEA is associated with a new, renewed,
    or copied Rx, then in the ORDER DEA ARCHIVE file (#101.52), the field
    DETOX # will contain the DEA expiration date in Fileman format, and the
    DEA # may be blank. 
     
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Each of the following issues reported above are being addressed the
 following way:
   
 a. The users will no longer be able to renew a detox Rx if the current
    prescriber on the Rx does not have a valid DETOX # on file. The menu
    options Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] and
    Barcode Batch Prescription Entry [PSO BATCH BARCODE] were modified to
    display the following message if the user tries to renew the Rx:
  
      Provider must have a valid DETOX# for this Rx 
   
 b. The users will no longer be able to copy a detox Rx if the current
    prescriber on the Rx does not have a valid DETOX # on file. The following
    message will be displayed by Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM 
    BACKDOOR ORDERS] if the user tries to copy the Rx:
  
      Provider must have a valid DETOX# for this Rx
    
 c. The users will no longer be able to speed renew a detox Rx if the current
    prescriber on the Rx does not have a valid DETOX # on file. The following
    message will be displayed by the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM
    BACKDOOR ORDERS] option if the user tries to speed renew the Rx:
  
      Rx# NNNNNN - Provider does not have a valid DETOX# required for this Rx
  
 d. The users will no longer be able to speed renew a prescription if the
    number of refills entered is greater than the maximum number of refills
    allowed for a specific prescription. The following message will be 
    displayed in the Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS]
    option if the user enters a # OF REFILLS greater than the maximum 
    allowed for the specific prescription:
  
      Rx# NNNNNN - # of Refills requested exceeds maximum allowed (5) for 
      this Rx
  
 e. If the prescriber DEA # is expired s/he will no longer be accepted as a
    valid provider for a detox #. If the user tries to select such prescriber
    the following message will be displayed by the Patient Prescription
    Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] :
  
      Provider must have a valid DEA# or VA# to write prescriptions for this
      drug.
  
 f. The Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] and the View
    Prescriptions [PSO VIEW] options were modified to retrieve the prescriber
    DEA# and DETOX# from the ORDER DEA ARCHIVE file (#101.52). Before, it was
    retrieving the latest DEA# and DETOX# for the prescriber which could have
    been expired since s/he wrote the prescription and by consequence would
    display as blank.
    
 Technical Resolution:
 --------------------- 
 The routines PSOBBC, PSODIR, PSON52, PSONEW2, PSOORCPY, PSOORFI5, PSOORNE5,
 PSOPKIV2, PSORENW, PSORENW4 and PSOUTIL have been modified to check and
 prevent a prescriber without a valid DETOX# to be assigned to a renewed
 prescription that requires a prescriber with a valid DETOX#. And the 
 routine PSORXVW was modified to retrieve the DEA# and DETOX# values from
 the CPRS order archive file instead of retrieving the latest info from the
 NEW PERSON file (#200).
  
 2. R16854127FY18 - FILL DATE prompt range incorrect
  
 Problem:
 --------
 It was reported by the Meds By Mail group that when they were entering new
 prescriptions with zero refills into VistA using the Patient Prescription
 Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option. If the prescription has zero
 refills the prescription's expiration date is set to the issue date plus 
 days supply. Because of mailing time to and from Meds by Mail, they often
 have prescriptions "expire" in VistA before a patient can receive them when
 using a valid fill date and issue date.   
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The date range allowed for the FILL DATE field was modified to accept a date
 366 days in the future for non-controlled substances and 184 days for
 controlled substances drugs when entering a new prescription.
   
 Technical Resolution:
 --------------------- 
 The routine PSODIR2 was modified to expand the date range for the FILL DATE
 prompt as indicated above.
    
 3. I5855290FY15 - CK Hidden Option and Remote Order Checks
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
 The CK Hidden Option in Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR
 ORDERS] does not pull in remote orders.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Code in line POST+14^PSODRG was preventing the call to process duplicate
 drug checks and, as such, it omitted remote order checks as well.  This
 line of code will be modified by this patch.
  
 4. I17185111FY18 - Error when changing routing from Window to Mail 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A site reported an error after answering the prompt "Mail/Window" 
 when finishing an outpatient prescription.  Error logged was: 
 <UNDEFINED>MW+4^PSODIR2 *PSODIR("DFLG").  
  
 This error occurred when the order was pending, the patient had
 "Other Language Preference" set to YES, and the user was finishing 
 the prescription.  While finishing, the user first edited "Patient 
 Instructions" (entered text at both instruction prompts), and then
 edited "Mail/Window".  When they returned at Mail/Window, the hard
 error occurred.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine ^PSODIR2, paragraph MW, was modified so that array variable
 PSODIR("DFLG") is now protected by the $G function, in case the data 
 has not previously been set. Protected PSODIR("FIELD") with a $G,
 as well.

 Post Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 None.
  
   
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;[DATE];[BUILD NUMBER] 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
 ----------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSO*7.0*504 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSO*7.0*504 in
 the patch list section on line 2.
