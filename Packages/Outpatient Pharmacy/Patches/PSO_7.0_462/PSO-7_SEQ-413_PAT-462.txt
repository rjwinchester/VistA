Category: 
  - Routine

 The patch addresses the following issues:
  
 1. When processing several window prescriptions and setting one as
    mail-out using manual, CM, for Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy
    (CMOP), none of the window labels printed.
  
 2. When a delayed order is placed for a controlled substance and then gets

 1. I9843052FY16-OTHER LABEL NOT PRINTED WITH MANUAL CMOP
  
 Problem:
 =======
 While user was processing several window Rx's and setting one as
 mail-out using manual "CM" for CMOP in Medical Profile screen,
 none of the window labels printed after queuing, requiring the
 reprint of labels.
  
 Resolution:
 ==========
 Code in routine OS^PSORESUS modified to remove value of package 
 references list after it sends RX to be suspended to CMOP. 
 If value of list does not exist after exit from OS^PSORESUS 
 then it will be restored by other code and will contain all
 package references allowing the process to queue other RXs 
 for label printing.
  
 Routine: PSORESUS
  
 2. I9850972FY16-SIGN NOT VERIFIED
  
 Problem:
 =======
 When a delayed order is placed for a controlled substance
 and then gets released to the pharmacy package on a day different 
 than the day it was signed, the pharmacy package is creating the 
 message hash for comparison using the release date. The original
 hash created for comparison was built using the signing date.
 The result is that the system thinks the prescription has been
 tampered with and it causes an auto-discontinue.
  
 Resolution:
 ==========
 Modified signature verification process at VERIFY^PSOPKIV1
 code to use signature date instead of release date.
  
 Routine: PSOPKIV1
