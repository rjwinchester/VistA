 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 1. INC000000965986 - LRMIEDZ Subscript Error
   
 Problem:
 --------
 The VITEK LITERAL routine LAMIVTL4 incorrectly sets the variable LRTS to 
 null at INIT+1. Later, the routine calls UNDO^LRMIEDZ where the variable
 is used to access the ACCESSION FILE (#68).  The null value causes a 
 Subscript Error and knocks the user out of VistA.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The patch modifies LAMIVTL4 in two (2) places:
  
    1. An erroneous subscript is removed from the reference to ^LRO(68,...)
       at INIT+1. The extra subscript caused the returned value of a $ORDER
       to be null.
  
    2. A new line of code is added after VER1+2. The added line tests the
       value of LRTS and assures that it is non-null prior to the call to 
       ^LRMIEDZ.
  
       Routine: LAMIVTL4
   
    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
  
    This patch may be loaded with users on the system. You may wish to 
    install it during non-peak hours.  Installation will take less than 1 
    minute. It is recommended to disable the VITEK LITERAL [LA VITEK 
    LITERAL] option at the "DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols?" prompt.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
    problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LA*5.2*83.
  
       When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//", respond NO.  
  
       When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//", respond YES.
                
       a. When prompted "Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out of
