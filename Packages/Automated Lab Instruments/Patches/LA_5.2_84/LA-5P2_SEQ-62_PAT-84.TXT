Subject: REMARKS WITH PIPE CHARACTER & OBX ESCAPE CHARACTERS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch modifies code in two (2) routines to correct HL7 escape 
 characters in OBX result segments and properly handle pipe "|" characters 
 in remarks from lab instruments. 
  
 Associated Remedy Ticket(s):
 ============================
 1. INC000000615847 - OBX Escape Character
 2. INC000000615848 - Remarks with Pipe Character

 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LA*5.2*84 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LA*5.2*84 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC000000615847 - OBX Escape Characters
   
 Problem:
 --------
 When incoming Health Level 7 (HL7) messages with a CH result in OBX-5, the
 code is not un-escaping the HL7 escaped characters.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The code at PROCESS^LA7VIN5 is modified to un-escape (using 
 $$UNESC^LA7VHLU3) the result in the HL7 message.
  
 Routines: LA7VIN5
  
 2. INC000000615847 - Remarks with Pipe Character
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When Auto Instrument routines are storing CH result remarks that contain 
 the pipe ('|') character in the ^LAH global (PROCESSED LOAD/WORK LIST 
 DATA FILE #68.3), it is possible that the text within the pipes can be 
 interpreted as FileMan word processing windows or frames and will get 
 interpreted inappropriately. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This defect can be corrected by setting the DIWF flag to "|" rather than 
 null prior to calling the Kernel utility routine ^DIWP to format the text 
 in routine ^LASET.  The "|" suppresses FileMan's attempt to process the 
 pipe character. 
  
 Routines: LASET
  
    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LA*5.2*84'.
  
       When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'. 
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
