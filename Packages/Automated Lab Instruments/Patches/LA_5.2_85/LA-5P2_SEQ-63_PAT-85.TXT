Subject: LEDI SNOMED CODE ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses three (3) issues of Laboratory Electronic Data 
 Interchange (LEDI) HL7 interfaces:
  
 1.  An application error occurs when processing results if a Systemized 
     Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) code is not defined on the
     collecting site for the specimen.
  
 2.  Override SNOMED codes are not referenced when processing incoming 
     orders.
  
 3.  Override SNOMED codes are not sent with results.

 3. INC000001080712 - Override SNOMED code issue on outgoing results
  
 Blood Bank Review:
 ==================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LA*5.2*85 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by 
 ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LA*5.2*85 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LA*5.2*85 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC000000900556 - Result transaction SNOMED code application errors
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An application error is generated by a collecting site during processing 
 of incoming result transactions if the collecting site does not have a 
 SNOMED code on file for the topography and the host sites sends a SNOMED 
 code.  Because of the application error, the HL7 table 0070 is not being
 checked to determine if the topography sent by the host site is valid.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine LA7VIN4 is modified to not generate an application error if the 
 collecting site has no SNOMED code on file but the host site is sending 
 one. Specimen validation then proceeds to the HL70070 table.
  
 Routine: LA7VIN4
  
 2. INC000000917708 - Override SNOMED code issue on incoming orders
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A collecting site may be a non-VA facility which does not have the same 
 SNOMED codes on file as a VA facility. This presents a problem when a 
 VA facility (the host site) receives orders from the non-VA facility (the 
 collecting site). An application error is generated at the host site 
 because of the discrepancy.
  
 LEDI software had developed the Map Non-VA SNOMED CT codes [LA7S MAP
 NON-VA SNOMED CODES] option to allow for this situation. The intent was
 that a specimen type/collection sample could have an "override" SNOMED
 code defined on the host site system.
  
 However, the code on the host site which de-formats the HL7 order 
 transactions does not reference the file set by the option LA7S MAP 
 NON-VA SNOMED CODES. Therefore, an application error is generated that 
 the order cannot be filed due to the SNOMED code discrepancy.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine LA7SMU2 is modified to check the LA7S MAP NON-VA SNOMED CODES 
 configuration on the host site for override SNOMED codes when processing
 orders from a collecting site.
  
 Routine: LA7SMU2
  
 3. INC000001080712 - Override SNOMED code issue on outgoing results
  
 Problem:
 --------
 LEDI code was corrected under ticket INC000000917708 so that the host
 facility will reference override SNOMED code and file the order.
  
 However, when the order is resulted, an application error will occur on 
 the collecting site because the host is not sending back the collecting 
 site's override SNOMED code.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Routine LA7VOBRB is modified to send back the collecting site's override 
 SNOMED code in the result transaction.

    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LA*5.2*85'.
  
       When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'. 
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
