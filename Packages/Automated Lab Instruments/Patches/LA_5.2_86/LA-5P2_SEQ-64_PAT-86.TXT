Subject: LEDI ISSUES: BUILD MANIFEST DATE PROBLEM AND PREVENT PROCESSING ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two (2) Laboratory Electronic Data Interchange (LEDI)
 issues:
  
 1. A test may be built to more than one shipping manifest. A test should
    be built to only one shipping manifest.
  
 2. A null subscript software error may occur which is caused by several
    interface situations which occur simultaneously.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC000000900094 - Test built to more than one shipping manifest
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Tests from a previous date which roll over to the current date can be
    built to multiple LEDI shipping manifests.  The current date is 
    specified during one shipping manifest build session.  The previous 
    date is specified during a subsequent shipping manifest build session.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine LA7SMU is modified to set the LAB SHIPPING MANIFEST (#62.8)
    file internal entry number (IEN) into the SHIPPING MANIFEST (#9) field
    of the ACCESSION (#68) file for both the original order date and 
    the current date subscripts. Previously the ACCESSION (#68) file
    SHIPPING MANIFEST (#9) field was set for only the current date.
  
    Routine: LA7SMU
  
 2. INC000000946598 - LA7VIN3 software error
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A software error may occur during processing of LEDI transactions.  
    The error is caused by a timing situation that can occur when VistA Lab
    hands results off to the Health Data Repository (HDR) interface.  
    However, the HDR subscriber(s) may not be set up to receive the results
    for various reasons.  If a second set of results is transmitted through
    LEDI, a software error may occur.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine LA7VIN3 is modified to check for null subscripts for two 
    variables before attempting an update to the LAB PENDING ORDERS ENTRY
    (#69.6) file.  Interface logic then proceeds to correctly update the
    LAB PENDING ORDERS ENTRY (#69.6) file for the accession being
    processed.
  
    Routine: LA7VIN3
  
    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LA*5.2*86'.
  
       When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'. 
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
