 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1. I9917553FY16 - Veterans ID Cards in Point of Care Interface
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Point of Care (POC) processing for lab tests cannot identify a patient
    by scanning a Veterans ID Card (VIC) barcode.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify lab POC processing to recognize the VIC number when it is
    present in the PID (Patient Identifier) segment of HL7 processing and
    to use the VIC card number to identify the patient.
  
    Note:
    -----
  
    Veterans ID Cards may contain both a barcode and magnetic stripe.  
    Currently, Point of Care devices can only be used with barcodes - not 
    magnetic stripes.  However, if the devices are able to use magnetic 
    stripes in the future, the Point of Care vendors will need to "escape" 
    the embedded "^" in the magnetic stripe before sending the transaction 
    through the HL7 interface.  The "^" character is a reserved HL7 
    delimiter.  VistA logic will then need to be changed to "unescape" the 
    character depending on the vendor changes.
  
    Note:
    -----
  
    Additional information is available in document LA*5.2*87 VHIC Card

 ==================== Installation Instructions ================== 
 This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
 install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
 minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       Preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch prior to
       installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' option
       at this time. You may also compare the routines in your production
       account to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare a
       Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'LA*5.2*87'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//, 
       choose 'NO'. 
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Compare the checksum of routine LA7VIN2 to the "After" checksum listed in 
 the patch description.
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 The routines can be restored to the previous versions by installing from
 the backup MailMan message that was sent before installation.
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
 ----------------------------------
 Checksum of the routine LA7VIN2 can be compared to the "Before" value 
 listed in the patch description.
