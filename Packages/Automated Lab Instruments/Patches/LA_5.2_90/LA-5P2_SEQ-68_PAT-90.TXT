Subject: MICROBIOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 The build for this patch is distributed as part of a multi-package build 
 that contains LR*5.2*474 and LA*5.2*90 and contains functionality that 
 will allow Microbiology instrumentation to utilize the Lab Universal
 Interface. 
  
 By utilizing the Universal interface and middleware sites will be able to 
 interface microbiology devices to a UI standard interface. New
 functionality will be applied that will allow for a "MI" subscripted test
 to be added to the Auto Instrument file. There will also be enhanced
 result processing and verify/release functions (see LR*5.2*474 patch
 descriptions for additional details).
  
 This patch is distributed in support of the VistA Laboratory Enhancement
 (VLE) Microbiology/Data Innovations interface utilizing the Laboratory
 Universal Interface.
  
 The patch contains a modification to the AUTO INSTRUMENT (#62.4) file 
 that will change the name of the "CHEM TESTS" (#30) field to "LABORATORY
 TESTS" and modify the input screen to allow "MI" subscripted tests to be
 added to an Auto Instrument entry. The trigger on the TEST (#.01) field
 was also modified so that only tests with a value in the LOCATION (DATA
 NAME) (#5) will set the ROUTINE STORAGE (#11) field.
  
 Additional Information:
 -----------------------
 This patch contains an enhancement to the antibiotic susceptibility 
 result processing to accommodate the need for laboratories to 
 report/document variations in susceptibility testing related to 
 differences between in vitro susceptibility testing and in vivo action. 
 An example is extended-spectrum_Beta-lactamases (ESBL).
  
 Susceptibility results received as coded entries can be from the SNOMED 
 CT code system or a site-designated local code (L).
  
 The interface supports the following SNOMED CT codes to report 
 susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
  
 131196009    susceptible
 260357007    moderately susceptible
 264841006    intermediately susceptible
 30714006     resistant
 10828004     positive
 260385009    negative
  
 Local codes in the role of answers can be entered on an interface 
 specific basis using the option Add/Edit Local Identifier [LA7V 62.47 
 LOCAL IDENTIFIER]
  
 An example of reporting ESBL status is the following HL7 OBX segment 
 fragment.

 Blood Bank Review:
 ==================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LA*5.2*90 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by ProPath
 standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA Patches.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LA*5.2*90 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical elements
 functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LA*5.2*90 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of
 installation of this patch.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 This patch install must be coordinated with the Laboratory ADPAC to 
 ensure that all Lab Interface related activities are halted.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:  
 ------------------------------
 Ensure that all Lab Interface activity has been halted !!
  
 This would include:
 -Editing of an Auto Instrument file entry, 
 -Turn off the Auto Downloading process to prevent the building and 
 downloading of a Load/Worklist to the Instrument Manager.
 -Shut down all LA7UI logical links and any other HL7 process (HLZTCP or 
 HLLP processes) to prevent the processing of result messages from the IM.
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system as long as the above 
 process controls have been followed.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
  
 This installation will modify the CHEM TESTS field (#30) in the AUTO 
 INSTRUMENT file (#62.4) by changing the following:
  
   The name of the field will be changed to LABORATORY TESTS
   The screen on the field will now allow "MI" subscripted tests
   The ROUTINE STORAGE (#11) value set by the trigger on the TESTS 
   (#.01) field will not happen for "MI" subscripted tests
   The original ROUTINE STORAGE trigger code has been replace with a new 
   style AD cross-reference.
    
 1.      DOWNLOAD HOST KIDS FILE 
         ----------------------
         Download the KIDS file LAB_MICRO_INTERFACE_RELEASE_1_0.KID from 
         the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory of Albany, Hines, or the Salt
         Lake OIFO to the appropriate directory on your system.
  
 2.      LOAD DISTRIBUTION
