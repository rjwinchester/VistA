Subject: NATIVE DOMAIN SERVICE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Interagency Program Office 
 (IPO) and the Department of Defense (DoD) is tasked by its charter with
 leading the Departments' efforts "to implement national health data
 standards for interoperability and [be] responsible for establishing,
 monitoring, and approving the clinical and technical standards profile
 and processes to ensure a seamless [exchange] of health data." This 
 task of Native Domain standardization is aligned with achieving the 
 goals outlined in the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 
 requiring that the Departments' "healthcare data [are] computable in 
 real-time and [comply] with existing national data standards" and that 
 the "data [are] standardized as national standards continue to evolve."
  
 VA clinicians historically used non-standardized clinical terminologies
 which are inconsistent within the VA user community as well as within 
 the currently accepted data standards as established by Office of the
 National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC).
 Implementation of Native Standardization will allow a streamlined 
 method for data sharing, performing clinical decision support and 
 engaging in national data reporting and analysis.  The VA has recently 
 established a process for implementing standard 
 terminology/terminologies within individual clinical domains for the
 exchange of data. The intent of this effort is to provide the detailed
 groundwork necessary for industry-wide interoperability. By providing a
 detailed analysis of the current state of the applicable domains and 
 recommendations regarding the path forward, the Native Domain 
 Standardization supports VA's efforts to remain at the forefront of 
 healthcare data exchange.
  
 In order for the LOINC Code supported by the new MASTER LABORATORY TEST
 FILE (#6.3) created in Laboratory patch LR*5.2*486 the AUTOMATED LAB 
 INSTRUMENTS routine LA7VHLU5 had to be modified. The standing call 
 from LA7VHLU5 to Lab Services routine LRVER1 is modified to include the
 Laboratory test File (#60) Test IEN.
