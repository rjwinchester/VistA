 Description:
 ============
 Patch LA*5.2*91 removes the limitation on the number of instruments from 
 the Auto Instrument File (#62.4) that can be viewed and selected when 
 using option Verify Micro Auto Data (LA MI VERIFY AUTO). The current 
 VistA code displays a list of no more than 99 instruments from the Auto 
 Instrument file when using this option, even though the Auto Instrument 
 File can contain as many as 999 instruments. Users will now be able to 
 view and select any instrument from the Auto Instrument File when using 
 this option. 
  
 This intake has been implemented locally at the Syracuse, New York 
 VAMC.
  
 This patch addresses the following requirement:
  
         VHBAO: NEED502510 Manage Laboratory Specimens: As an 
                authorized user, I need to manage lab specimens 
                submitted for testing, so that the most accurate 
                results are available for the patient record.
