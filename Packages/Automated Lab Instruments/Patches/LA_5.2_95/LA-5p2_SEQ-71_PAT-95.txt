Associated patches: (v)LA*5.2*74   <<= must be installed BEFORE `LA*5.2*95'

Subject: CUSTOMIZABLE PARAMETER FOR LABORATORY SHIPPING MANIFEST DEFAULT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 LA*5.2*95 creates a customizable parameter in VistA that allows 
 Laboratory staff at each site to determine the default response when 
 prompted to create a shipping manifest. The manifests are vital to 
 ensuring that all specimens arrive at the correct destination. The 
 current default response (NO) is frequently accepted by hurried 
 technicians, when in actuality they need to create a manifest.
  
 This patch creates the new parameter Default to create new manifest [LR 
 MANIFEST DEFLT CREATE] in the Parameter Definition (#8989.51) file, which 
 allows each site to choose the appropriate default response to the "There 
 is not an open shipping manifest for [shipping configuration]. Do you 
 want to start one?" prompt. To change the default response, users must 
 enter Package Level Parameter Edit [LR7O PAR PKG] at the "Select OPTION 
 NAME:" prompt, then enter the shipping configuration at the new "For 
 Default to create new manifest - Select Shipping Configuration:" prompt, 
 and then enter YES at the new "Create new manifest default: NO//:" 
 prompt. If the parameter is not defined for the shipping configuration, 
 then the default response will be NO.

 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of this patch, it is not recommended for 
 backout. However, in the event that a site decides to back out this 
 patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit 
 a CA Technologies Service Desk Manager (CA SDM) ticket. The development 
 team will then assist with the backout process. 
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the LA routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the LA routines have been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain 
 the designation of patch LA*5.2*95 on line 2 in the patch list section.
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out; it does not confirm that other patch component changes 
 have been backed out.
