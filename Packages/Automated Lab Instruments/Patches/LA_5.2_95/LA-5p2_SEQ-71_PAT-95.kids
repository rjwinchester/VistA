When an Anatomic Pathology (AP) case is accessioned, this parameter will 
"KRN",8989.51,788,20,2,0)
control how the system should assign a default accession number to the 
"KRN",8989.51,788,20,3,0)
case being logged in. (Note: The user will still be able to override the 
"KRN",8989.51,788,20,4,0)
default, and select a different accession number, if they so choose).
"KRN",8989.51,788,20,5,0)

'First Available Number' - The system will start searching from number

one, and the first available accession number that is found in that
"KRN",8989.51,788,20,8,0)
accession area will be used as the default accession number for the new
"KRN",8989.51,788,20,9,0)
case being logged in. Choosing this method will minimize the likelihood of
"KRN",8989.51,788,20,10,0)
having any gaps in the accession numbering, however, there is the
"KRN",8989.51,788,20,11,0)

the last accession number that was logged in, and the next available 
"KRN",8989.51,788,20,15,0)
number that is found in that accession area will be used as the default 
"KRN",8989.51,788,20,16,0)
accession number for the new case being logged in. Choosing this method 
"KRN",8989.51,788,20,17,0)
should better keep the accession numbers in sequence, but there is the
