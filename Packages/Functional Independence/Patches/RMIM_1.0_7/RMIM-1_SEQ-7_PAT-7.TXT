 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================= 
  
 INC000000068712 - Selected cosigner not crossing over to VISTA
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user is writing a note in FIM, they can select the expected   
 cosigner for the note, but when you view the note in CPRS or VISTA, there   
 isn't a name in the expected cosigner field.  The notes are never signed   
 by the cosigner because they aren't aware that they need to be signed.    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Update GUI to save cosigner information in VistA by adding Cosigner information
 to array of information being passed to VistA.
