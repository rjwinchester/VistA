 1. 746725 - FIM Windows 10 compatibility updates
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The FIM Graphical User Interface (GUI) help files need to be 
 updated to be combatable with Windows 10.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The FIM GUI has been updated to utilize .CHM help files as .HLP
 help files are no longer supported in Windows 10. Additionally,
 the FIM GUI has been modified to work with high Dots Per Inch (DPI)
 and recompiled in Delphi XE 10.2 to meet current Technical Reference 
 Model (TRM) requirements.
