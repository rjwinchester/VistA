Subject: Transition to become two factor authentication compliant. 

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch will update the log in procedure to the Functional Independence
 Measurement (FIM) GUI to use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) which will
 require the use of a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card.
  
 In order to make the transition to 2FA, it was also necessary to upgrade 
 the Functional Independence Measurement (FIM) GUI to Delphi version XE8 to
 implement the new Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker allowing compliance.
  
 RMIM*1.0*8 does not update any VistA routines but does update the 
 Functional Independence Measurement (FIM) GUI.

  Problem: 
  --------
  The Department of Veterans Affairs Cybersecurity Task Force has been tasked 
  by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Inspector General (IG) to 
  address identified material weaknesses. This task force has mandated that 
  all internal, user facing VA applications become two factor authentication
  (2FA) compliant by April 30, 2017. 
   
  In order to be compliant, applications are required to authenticate users 
  via Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards.  
   
  Note: Usernames and password will no longer be permitted for employees and
  contractors to access VA applications.  
    
  Resolution:
  -----------
  The Functional Independence Measurement (FIM) GUI has been upgraded to
  Delphi XE8 to allow access to the latest version of the RPC Broker,
  implementing 2FA.
