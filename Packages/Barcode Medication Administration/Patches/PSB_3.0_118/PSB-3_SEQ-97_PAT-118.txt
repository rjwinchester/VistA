Subject: BCMA WINDOWS 10, DELPHI 10 UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Information and 
 Technology requires that applications remain compliant with the Technical 
 Reference Model (TRM) regarding the version of tools used for 
 development. This patch accomplished this by updating the version of 
 Delphi to XE10.2 used for the Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) 
 client and parameters applications.
  
 The patch will also resolve the following issues:
 1. INC3309234 - Unable to use right click options in BCMA on Windows 10 
    machine.
  
 2. INC3309019 - BCMA display differences between Windows 7 and Windows 10
  
 3. I9893211FY16: BCMA: Help Does not work
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC3309234 - Unable to use right click options in BCMA on Windows 10 
    machine.
  
    Problem:
    --------  
    Users reported that when trying to use right click menu options 
    in BCMA on Windows 10 test machines, they would not work 
    correctly.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------  
    The Delphi Graphical User Interface (GUI) code has been updated to call
    the correct menu options when the menu is called via the right click
    option. 
  
 2. INC3309019 - BCMA display differences between Windows 7 and Windows 10
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Users reported display differences in certain fields when BCMA was 
    being run on a Windows 10 machine versus a Windows 7 machine. 
    This reported difference includes fields such as Requestor Phone Number
    and Preferred Contact Method. Also reported are visual differences in
    the pop up windows on a Windows 10 machine.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The Delphi code has been converted to Delphi 10.2, and updated to 
    Windows 10 standards to keep the displays and pop up windows 
    consistent with how they looked on Windows 7 machines. 
  
 3. I9893211FY16: BCMA: Help Does not work
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    BCMA users reported help not working correctly on a Windows 10 
    Machine. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The help files are being updated to be compatible with Windows 10, and 
    are being converted to a supported current version of RoboHelp. 
  
    NOTE:  A pop-up window, Downloading Help File, may display when a user 
    first logs into BCMA on a computer. The help file is downloaded to the
    user's local application data folder.  The message in the pop-up window
    says:
    Retrieving help file for Bar Code Medication Administration
    Press "ABORT" to cancel this process.
