 INC0962039 - WNY - Vista Not Updating BCBU orders when patients are
              discharged/deceased
 INC1002829 - BCBU patient census not updating
 (Duplicate)
        
 Problem: 
 --------
 An issue was discovered with the Barcode Medication Administration (BCMA) 
 Backup System (BCBU) after the installation of patch PSB*3*105. After the
 patient is discharged or a date of death is entered for him/her the patient
 data is not being properly removed from the BCBU workstation. In the case of
 discharged patients that are later admitted or have a clinic appointment
 their orders from their previous admission are still visible on the BCBU
 workstation and are listed on the patient's Medication Administration Reports
 (MAR).
      
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Removed the filter introduced by PSB*3*105 to prevent alerts from being
 generated for patient movements if the patient is no longer inpatient. The
 reason is because such filter prevented patient discharge events, which are
 handled as patient movements, from removing the patient's data from the 
 BCBU workstation. The filter was re-introduced at the Alert generation point
 and excludes patient discharge movements.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed routines ALPBUTL1 & ALPBCBU to remove the filter from the PMOV
 line tag and placed a check in the ERRLOG line tag to prevent Alerts for
 patient movement events after the patient had already been discharged.
  
 Test Sites: 
 -----------
 Upstate NY HCS
 Boston HCS   
  
 Pre-Installation Overview:
 --------------------------
 - Before installing this patch on BCMA Backup System (BCBU) workstations 
   ensure that BCBU workstation is running with the latest cache.dat file.
  
 - If your site uses the BCMA Backup System (BCBU) you should install this
   patch in all the BCBU workstations that are currently active at your site.

 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------- 
 The BAR CODE MED ADMIN (BCMA) users should not be using the application
 while this patch is being installed. It should take less than 2 minutes
 to install this patch. 
  
    1. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
       the LOAD DISTRIBUTION option and load PSB_3_110.KID  
   
    2. Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
       [XPD MAIN]:
  
        Edits and Distribution ...
        Utilities ...
        Installation ...  
   
    3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSB*3.0*110)
   
         a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
             transport global.
         b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
             the components of the KIDS build.
         c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when this 
             patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
             (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
         d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
             message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
             backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
       PSB*3.0*110.

 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the patch
 number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
 3.0;BAR CODE MED ADMIN;**[PATCH LIST]**;MARCH, 2004
    
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run to
 compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch description.
  
  
 Post-Installation Overview
 --------------------------
 None. 
  
   
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install).
 The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract
 PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function
 "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up routines onto
 the VistA System. 
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of the
 PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line Routine
 Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the PSB*3.0*110
 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the Routines will no
 longer contain the designation of patch PSB*3.0*110 in the patch list section
 on line 2.
