Subject: BROKER TIMEOUT - MISSED MEDICATIONS REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue.
  
 1. R16686630FY17 - Ward 9C keeps getting this error (Timeout) intermittently
                    when trying to run the Missed Medications Report  
   
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. R16686630FY17 - Ward 9C keeps getting this error (Timeout) intermittently
                    when trying to run the Missed Medications Report  
    
 Problem: 
 --------
 Milwaukee VAMC reported getting a RPC Broker Timeout error when running the
 BCMA Missed Medications Report for one specific ward (9C). The reason they
 were getting this error is because Ward 9C has quite a few long term care
 patients and the report retrieves information for every single order with
 medication that requires removal (e.g., patches) for all patients in that
 ward before deciding whether the order should be in the report or not.
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the routine PSBUTL at the REMOVES line tag and moved the 
 screening filters up before the call to D PSJ1^PSBVT.  This change will
 have no impact whatsoever on the output of the report and it will
 considerably decrease the amount of time it takes to run it.
  
    
     
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Milwaukee VAMC
 Minneapolis HCS

 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
