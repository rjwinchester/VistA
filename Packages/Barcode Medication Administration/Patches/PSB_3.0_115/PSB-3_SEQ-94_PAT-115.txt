Subject: BCBU WORKSTATION INIT SENDS TO ALL HL LOGICAL LINKS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue.
  
 INC2794138 - When BCBU init is ran and only one HL7 link is entered it still
              updates numerous links
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 INC2794138 - When BCBU init is ran and only one HL7 link is entered it still
              updates numerous links
           
 Problem: 
 --------
 Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center reported a problem with
 the BCBU Initialize options below:
  
     Default Workstation Initialize [PSB BCBU INIT WRKSTN DFT]
     Divisional Workstation Initialize [PSB BCBU INIT WRKSTN DIV]
  
 Whenever these options were executed and one or more Workstation Link were
 selected for the initialization the option still generated and sent HL7
 message updates to all other existing BCBU Workstation Links.
  
 Solution:
 --------
 The two Workstation Initialize options above were modified to screen out any
 Workstation Link not selected from the HL7 update if the user selects one or
 more specific Workstation Link(s) to update when executing these options. In
 other words, only the selected Workstation Link(s) will be initialized.
   
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 The routines ALPBIN, ALPBIND and ALPBINP were modified to keep track and 
 screen out Workstation Link(s) not selected for the HL7 initialization
 update.

 Pre-Installation Overview:
 --------------------------
 - If your site uses the BCMA Backup System (BCBU) you should install this
   patch in all the BCBU workstations that are currently active at your site.
 - This patch required Fileman v22.2 to be installed before this patch can be
   installed. Therefore it is important that the BCBU workstations where the
   this patch will be installed already have been updated with the latest
   version of Fileman (v22.2). 
  
  
 Patch retrieval Instructions: 
 ----------------------------
 1. Retrieve the KIDS distribution host file. This patch will be
    distributed in a host file. The name of the host file is:
  
         PSB_3_115.KID
     
     Files can be obtained from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of
     the OI Field Offices. The preferred method is to retrieve the file
     using Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from
     DOWNLOAD.VISTA.DOMAIN.EXT, which will transmit the file from the first
     available server. Alternatively, sites may elect to retrieve the file
     from a specific OI Field Office.

 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------- 
 The BAR CODE MED ADMIN (BCMA) users should not be using the application
 while this patch is being installed. It should take less than 2 minutes
 to install this patch. 
  
    1. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
       the LOAD DISTRIBUTION option and load PSB_3_115.KID  
   
    2. Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
       [XPD MAIN]:
  
        Edits and Distribution ...
        Utilities ...
        Installation ...  
   
    3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSB*3.0*115)
   
         a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
             transport global.
         b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
             the components of the KIDS build.
         c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when this 
             patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
             (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
         d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
             message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
             backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
       PSB*3.0*115.
  
    5. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//" respond NO.  
   
    6. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
  
 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the patch
 number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
 3.0;BAR CODE MED ADMIN;**[PATCH LIST]**;MARCH, 2004
    
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run to
 compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch description.
  
  
 Post-Installation Overview
 --------------------------
 None. 
  
   
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install).
 The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract
 PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function
 "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up routines onto
 the VistA System. 
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of the
 PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line Routine
 Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the PSB*3.0*115
 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the Routines will no
 longer contain the designation of patch PSB*3.0*115 in the patch list section
 on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
