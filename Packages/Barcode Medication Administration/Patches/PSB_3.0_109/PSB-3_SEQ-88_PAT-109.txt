Subject: BCMA MISSED MEDICATION REPORT ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue.
  
 INC0328665 - Issue with BCMA Missed Medications Report
    
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 INC0328665 - Issue with BCMA Missed Medications Report
       
 Problem: 
 --------
 An issue was discovered with the Barcode Medication Administration (BCMA) 
 Missed Medications Report for 'odd' (non-standard) schedule orders, e.g.
 Q18H - ONCE EVERY 18 HOURS. When the report is run for a date range that
 starts prior to the start date/time of such orders in some cases it will
 mistakenly include these orders in the report even if the order does not
 have any missing dose for the date range selected for the report.
     
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine PSBOMM was modified at line tag EN1+49 to prevent it from
 calculating a dose date/time that is prior to the order start date/time.
  
       
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Upstate NY HCS
 Sioux Falls VAMC

 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
