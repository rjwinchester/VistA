Description:
============

                 Front ends
    
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 R19023599FY18 - PSB GUI Context consuming a lot of CPU on Bay Pines VistA
                 Front ends
    
 Problem: 
 --------
 An issue was discovered when loading the BCMA coversheet and the patient
 has an order with an administration schedule that does not have a whole
 number of hour(s) frequency between administrations (e.g., 7 TIMEs A DAY,
 ONCE EVERY 3.5 HOURS, etc.). The reason is because the program that
 calculates the next dose's administration date/time assumed the frequency to
 be a whole number of hours like 4 or 6 and not 3.1466 or 3.5. Since the
 program could not come up with a valid date/time it went into an infinite
 loop which would freeze the BCMA application when the users tried to view the
 patient's coversheet.
     
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine PSBCSUTX was modified at line tag NEXTADM+24 and NEXTADM+28 to
 replace the call to $$SCH^XLFDT with a call to $$FMADD^XLFDT that will now
 calculate the the next adminstration date/time by adding the number of
 frequency minutes to the last administration date/time.
