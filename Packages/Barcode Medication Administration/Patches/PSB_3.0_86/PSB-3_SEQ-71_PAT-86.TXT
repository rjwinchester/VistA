Description:
============

 This Patch Addresses 7 issues:
  
 1.  An Undefined error occurs at SCANPT+49^PSBRPC if an accent (`) mark is
     passed in when manually keying in a patient's wristband.
 2.  Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) report headers display the
     last ward and room/bed the patient was admitted to after they are 
     discharged.
 3.  BCMA report headers and the BCMA Virtual Due List (VDL) round a
     patient's weight to less significant digits than the Computerized Record
     System (CPRS) application when converting weight from pounds to kilograms.
 4.  BCMA report headers display the diagnosis for a patient's last
     admission after the patient has been discharged. 
 5.  The BCMA Coversheet is loading slowly for long term care patients.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW
 ---------------
   
 1.  INC000001039982 - UNDEFINED>SCANPT+49^PSBRPC
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An Undefined error occurs at SCANPT+49^PSBRPC if an accent (`) mark is passed
 in when a user is manually keying in a patient's wristband.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBRPC was modified to quit and return the message "Invalid Patient
 Lookup" if an accent mark (`) is entered when scanning.
  
 2.  INC0000001045983 - BCMA report headers displays ward and room/bed after
                        discharge.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 BCMA report headers continue to display the last ward and room/bed a patient
 was admitted to after they are discharged.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBOHDR was modified to no longer display the ward or room/bed after
 the patient is discharged.
  
 3.  INC0000001093719 - A patient's weight in BCMA displays differently than
                        in CPRS
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The BCMA report headers and the BCMA Virtual Due List (VDL) round a patient's
 weight to less significant digits than the Computerized Patient Record System
 (CPRS) application when converting weight from pounds to kilograms.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSBOHDR and PSBRPC were modified to use a conversion factor of
 2.20462262 pounds/kilogram instead of 2.2 when calculating a patient's weight.
  
 4.  INC000001228282 - BCMA report headers display the diagnosis for a
                       patient's last admission after discharge
 Problem:
 --------
 BCMA report headers continue to display the diagnosis for a patient's last
 admission after the patient has been discharged.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBOHDR was modified to no longer display the diagnosis from the last
 admission after the patient has been discharged.
  
 5. INC000001253386 - BCMA coversheet loading very slow for long term
                      patients
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The BCMA Coversheet is loading slowly for long term care patients.  The issue
 is caused by a dangling variable PSBSTRT, which is set to the date of the first
 pro re nata (PRN) medication administered after a patient is admitted, by
 routine PSBPRN.  This variable is not being cleaned when using the unreleased
 version of Shared Broker XWB_1.1_58, and causing the Coversheet to loop through
 all PRN medications administered to the patient since admission.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBPRN was modified to New the PSBSTRT variable to ensure it is
 properly cleaned up when exiting the PSB GETPRNS Remote Procedure Call (RPC). 
 This will prevent the old date from hanging around when the coversheet is
 loaded.
  
 6.  INC000001260877 -  BCMA Unit Dose tab loading slowly for long term care     
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Unit Dose tab of the BCMA VDL loads slowly for long term care patients. 
 This is caused by the PSB GETPRNS RPC, which loops through all of a patient's
 administered PRN medications since they were admitted, which could be several
 years' worth of data.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBPRN was modified to limit the time frame to search for patient's
 administered PRN medications to 35 days, or the value of the PSB MED HIST DAYS
 BACK parameter, whichever is greater.
  
 7.  INC000001261136 - Medication Variance report displays med name twice
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The BCMA Medication Variance report displays the medication name twice under
 the medication field of the report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBOMV was modified to only write the medication name once.
  
 NOTES:
 ------
    Routines APSPFUNC and BEHOVM called from PSBOHDR and PSBRPC are 
    Indian Health Services only routines and will display as an XINDEX
    error when installing this patch in VA Accounts.  This functionality
    was introduced by patch PSB*3.0*42. This enhancement is intended to
    enable the BCMA application to recognize whether it is operating in
    the Indian Health Service (IHS) or Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
    environment, and respond by recognizing and displaying the patient
    identifier appropriate to the environment. This will enable a single
    version of BCMA to be maintained by VHA and yet be installed and
    operate in a "plug and play" fashion in an IHS or Tribal facility
    running Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS).
