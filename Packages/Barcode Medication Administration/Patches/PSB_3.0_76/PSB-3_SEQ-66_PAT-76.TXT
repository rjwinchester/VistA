Description:
============

 This Patch Addresses 6 issues:
  
 1. The Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Missed Medications
    report does not include orders with a status of "Renewed" 
 2. BCMA incorrectly rounds a patient's height down on the BCMA Virtual Due
    List (VDL) and on report headers, and incorrectly calculates a
    patient's weight on report headers.
 3. Orders with a start time exactly the same as the last administration
    time will display as not due in the BCMA Medication Administration
    History (MAH) report.
 4. The undefined error <UNDEFINED>FILEIT+10^PSBML *PSBHDR occurs
    when logging into BCMA.
 5. Immunizations given as Clinic orders in BCMA are not recorded in the 
    V IMMUNIZATIONS (#9000010.11) file. 
 6. BCMA accepts a partial scan of a patient's SSN when scanning a patient's
    wristband.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW
 ===============
   
 1. INC0000000765254 -  BCMA Missed Medications report does not include
                        orders with a status of "Renewed".
  
  
 Patient Safety Issue:
 ---------------------
 PSPO #2333
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The BCMA Missed Medications report does not include orders with a STATUS (#28) 
 of "Renewed" in the PHARMACY PATIENT (#55) file. 
  
 Resolution:
  -----------
 Routine PSBOMM was modified to include orders with a STATUS (#28) of "Renewed"
 on the BCMA Missed Medications report.
  
 2. INC00000000425989 - Patient's height and weight in BCMA does not match
                        height and weight in Vitals
  
 Problem:
 --------
 BCMA incorrectly rounds a patient's height down on the BCMA Virtual Due 
 List (VDL) and on all patient specific report headers, and incorrectly
 calculates a patient's Weight on patient specific report headers.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSBRPC and PSBOHDR were modified to round a patient's height to 
 the nearest centimeter for the BCMA VDL and patient specific report
 headers, and to correctly calculate a patient's weight on BCMA patient
 specific report headers.
  
  
 3. INC00000000728163 - Meds display as not due on MAH
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Orders with a start time exactly the same as the last scheduled
 administration time of the day will display as not due in the BCMA MAH
 report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBOMH was modified to display any orders whose start time is less than
 or equal to the day's last scheduled administration time.
  
 4. INC00000000865087 - <UNDEFINED>FILEIT+10^PSBML *PSBHDR
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An undefined error occurs in BCMA when logging into a patient who has had 
 a pain score entered in BCMA and then was marked "Entered in Error" in the
 Vitals or Vitals Lite GUIs, and the site is using the Shared Broker 
 Client last modified in 2012.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBRPC was modified to New the variable PSBHDR when calling
 SCANPT^PSBRPC.
  
 5. INC00000000967514 - BCMA2PCE Breaks with Clinic Orders
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Immunizations given as Clinic orders in BCMA are not recorded in the
 V IMMUNIZATIONS (#9000010.11) file.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSBPXFL and PSBPXLP were modified to record these outpatient
 immunizations in the V IMMUNIZATIONS (#9000010.11) file.
  
 6. INC00000001003352 - BCMA allows a partial scan of an SSN
  
 Patient Safety Issue:
 ---------------------
 PSPB #2617
  
 Problem:
 --------
 BCMA accepts a partial scan of a patient's SSN when scanning a patient's
 wristband.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBRPC was modified to only accept a full 9 digit SSN when scanning a
 patient's wristband.
  
 NOTES:
 ------
    Routines APSPFUNC and BDGF2 called from PSBOHDR and PSBRPC are 
    Indian Health Services only routines and will display as an XINDEX
    error when installing this patch in VA Accounts.  This functionality
    was introduced by patch PSB*3.0*42. This enhancement is intended to
    enable the BCMA application to recognize whether it is operating in
    the Indian Health Service (IHS) or Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
    environment, and respond by recognizing and displaying the patient
    identifier appropriate to the environment. This will enable a single
    version of BCMA to be maintained by VHA and yet be installed and
    operate in a "plug and play" fashion in an IHS or Tribal facility
    running Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS).
