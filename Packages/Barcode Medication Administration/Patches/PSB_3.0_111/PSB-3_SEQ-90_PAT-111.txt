Subject: EPIP: Missing Dose Report by Division Patch for a Patch

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch PSB*3.0*111 corrects an issue with the 'Missing Dose Followup'
 report as reported by a single VA site in a multidivisional setting. The
 issue states that after a record is selected for completion and then
 saved, it is not dropping off the list of available records. The expected
 behavior is that after a record in the report is completed and saved, it
 should be removed from the report selection list.
  
 The routine PSBMD is modified to correct this issue by refreshing the 
 report selection list when any record is completed and saved.

 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option. The message containing the

 the designation of patch PSB*3.0*111 on line 2 in the patch list section.
