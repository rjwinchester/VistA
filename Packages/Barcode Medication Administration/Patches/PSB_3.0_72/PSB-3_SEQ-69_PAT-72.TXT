Description:
============

     *************************** NOTE *************************
     *  This patch contains a post-install routine, which     *
     *  could cause excessive install times of several hours  *
     *  or more depending on the size of the database. Test   *
     *  sites reported an average install time of 2 hours.    * 
     *  See the installation section for more information.    *
     *                                                        *
     *  The patch should be installed when NO BCMA Client     *
     *  users are on the system. Users should remain off the  *
     *  system for a period of 10 minutes during installation.*
     **********************************************************
  
 This patch will resolve the following issues:
  
 1. The Medication History report in Bar Code Medication Administration
    (BCMA) displays amounts in the Units Given field for an order that has
    not been given. 
  
 2. When a user makes a change to an order using the Edit Med Log option,
    which does not change the action status, several reports display the
    initials of the person who edited the order instead of the person who
    created the action on the order.
  
 3. The BCMA Medication Log and Medication Variance report headers do not
    display the time frame of the report.
  
 4. The BCMA AUDIT LOG (#53.799) sub-file does not include an entry for Pro
    Re Nada (PRN) Effectiveness when a PRN is "Un-Given".
  
 5. The legend of the Medication Therapy report does not include users who
    entered comments for an order.
  
 6. The second line of routine PSBOPE has an invalid format.
  
 7. Update the unsupported $$UCASE^XUSG Application Programming Interface
    (API) to the supported API $$UP^XLFSTR in routine PSBMLLKU.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000389846 - Missing Dose Units Change
  
    Duplicate:
    ----------
    INC0000000334673
  
    Patient Safety Issue: PSPO #1682
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Medication History report in BCMA displays amounts in the Units
    Given field for an Intravenous Piggyback (IVPB) or Intravenous (IV)
    order that has a status of Held or Refused, or has had a Missing Dose
    requested. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines PSBML and PSBML2 were modified to store the dosage ordered in
    the DOSE ORDERED (#.02) field of the ADDITIVES (#53.796) and SOLUTIONS
    (#53.797) sub-files of the BCMA MEDICATION LOG (#53.79) file, and to
    only store the DOSE GIVEN (#.03) in the ADDITIVES (#53.796) and
    SOLUTIONS (#53.797) sub-files when the order is marked Given or
    Infusing. 
  
    Routine PSBOPM was modified to append the DOSE ORDERED (#.02) field
    to the ADDITIVES (#.01) field on the Medication History report. 
  
    Routine PSBOML was modified to use the DOSE ORDERED (#.02) field when
    displaying the dosage order on the Medication Log report.  
  
    Post-install routine PSB372P will be run upon installation to update
    the DOSE ORDERED (#.02) field of the ADDITIVES (#53.796) and SOLUTIONS
    (#53.797) sub-files with data from the DOSE GIVEN (#.03) field for all
    historical entries.
  
  
 2. INC000000351820 - Patch 45 initial issue doesn't look to resolve
                      showing Initials
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a user makes a change to an order using the Edit Med Log option,
    which does not change the ACTION STATUS (#.09) in the BCMA MEDICATION
    LOG (#53.79) file, several reports display the initials of the person
    who edited the order instead of the person who created the action on
    the order.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines PSBCSUTX, PSBMLLKU, PSBOMH1, PSBOML, PSBOMT, PSBOPE, and
    PSBOPM were modified to use the last ACTION BY LOG (#.05) field in
    the AUDIT LOG (#53.799) sub-file with an ACTION STATUS LOG (#.04) field
    containing "Field: ACTION STATUS" to get the initials for all BCMA
    reports which contain the initials.
  
  
 3. INC000000425372 - Some discrepancies in report headers for BCMA reports
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The BCMA Medication Log and Medication Variance report headers do not
    display the time frame of the report. This is inconsistent with other
    BCMA reports.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines PSBOML and PSBOMV were modified to include the start and stop
    times in the report header.
  
  
 4. INC000000460174 - PRN effectiveness reporting
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The BCMA AUDIT LOG (#53.799) sub-file of the BCMA MEDICATION LOG
    (#53.79) file does not include an entry for PRN Effectiveness when a
    PRN is "Un-Given".
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBML2 was modified to use FileMan to update the PRN REASON
    (#.21), PRN EFFECTIVENESS (#.22), PRN EFFECTIVENESS ENTERED BY (#.23),
    PRN EFFECTIVENESS ENTERED AT (#.24), PRN EFFECTIVENESS MINUTES (#.25),
    and PRN REASON FLAG (#.27) fields in the BCMA MEDICATION LOG (#53.79)
    file, which properly created the PRN Effectiveness entry in the BCMA
    AUDIT LOG (#53.799) sub-file.
  
  
 5. INC000000505556 - Medication Therapy report doesn't display complete
                      information
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The legend of the Medication Therapy report does not include users who
    entered comments for an order.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBOMT was modified to include the name of the user who entered
    a comment in the report's legend.
  
  
 6. INC000000953788 - Bar Code Med Admin - Patch Install Issue: warning
                      on compare at several Region 1 sites.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The second line of routine PSBOPE has an invalid format.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBOPE was modified to correct the second line of the routine.
  
  
 7. INC000000986997 - Specific Patient Selection throws error
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Unsupported API $$UCASE^XUSG is being removed.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBMLLKU was modified to use the supported API $$UP^XLFSTR.
  
    Note:
    -----
    Routines APSPFUNC, AUPNPAT and BDGF2 called from routine PSBMLLKU are 
    Indian Health Services (IHS) only routines and will display as an
    XINDEX error when installing this patch in VA Accounts. This
    functionality was introduced by patch PSB*3.0*42. This enhancement is
    intended to enable the BCMA application to recognize whether it is
    operating in the Indian Health Service (IHS) or Veterans Health
    Administration (VHA) environment, and respond by recognizing and
    displaying the patient identifier appropriate to the environment. This
    will enable a single version of BCMA to be maintained by VHA and yet be
    installed and operate in a "plug and play" fashion in an IHS or Tribal
    facility running Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS).
