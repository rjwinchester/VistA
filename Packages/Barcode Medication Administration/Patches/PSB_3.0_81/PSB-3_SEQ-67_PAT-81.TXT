Subject: IHS HRN CHANGES, MED HISTORY AND AADT X-REF ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This Patch Addresses 5 issues:
  
 1. The Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Medication History
    report displays data prior to the report start date when run in the
    Computerized Records System (CPRS) application.  
 2. BCMA Labels for Unit dose drugs are missing the Indian Health Services
    (IHS) Health Record Number (HRN) in place of Last 4 digits of a
    patient's Social Security Number (SSN) as the patient Identifier.
 3. The BCMA Unknown Actions Report does not display IHS HRN in place
    of Last 4 digits of a patient's Social Security Number (SSN) as the
    patient identifier.
 4. A dangling "AADT" index causes an undefined error to occur when
    a site runs the BCMA Extract (ECXBCM) option. 
 5. The Meds on Patient section of the BCMA Virtual Due List (VDL)
    displays an Intravenous (IV) bag as infusing after it has been marked
    completed if the Action Date/Time was edited using the Edit Med Log
    option.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW
 ===============
   
 1. INC0000000357532 - Different drug showing
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The BCMA Medication History report displays data prior to the report start date
 when run in the Computerized Records System (CPRS) application.  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Routine PSBOPM1 was modified to use the start date of the report as the
 start Point when search for data in the BCMA MEDICATION LOG (#53.79) file.
  
 2. INC00000000813843 - BCMA Label missing IHS HRN
  
 Problem:
 ========
 BCMA Labels for Unit dose drugs are missing the Indian Health Services
 (IHS) Health Record Number (HRN) in place of Last 4 digits of a patient's
 Social Security Number (SSN) as the patient Identifier.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Routines PSBOBL and PSBOBZ were modified to display the patients HRN on
 the label when printed from an IHS site. The label printing change
 is only for IHS sites.  No changes were made in VistA.
  
 3. INC00000001007788 - UNKNOWN ACTION Status report in BCMA does
                        not display HRN 
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The BCMA Unknown Actions Report does not display IHS HRN in place
 of Last 4 digits of a patient's Social Security Number (SSN) as the patient
 identifier.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Routine PSBOXA was modified to display the patient HRN on the Unknown
 Actions report when run on an IHS site.
  
 4. INC000000838556 - Bar Code Med Admin - Other: Dangling AADT X-ref
  
 Problem:
 ========
 A dangling "AADT" index causes an undefined error to occur when
 a site runs the BCMA Extract (ECXBCM) option.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Kill logic was added to the "AADT" index to clean up the global when the
 ACTION DATE/TIME (#.06) field is modified in the BCMA MEDICATION LOG
 (#53.79) file.  Post install routine PSB381P will clean up any "AADT" 
 indexes that do not have 0 nodes for the last 60 days from install date.

 5. INC0000000100542 - IV Bag displays as infusing on "Meds on Patient"
                            after it was completed
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The Meds on Patient section of the BCMA Virtual Due List (VDL) 
 displays an Intravenous (IV) bag as infusing after it has been marked
 completed if the Action Date/Time was edited using the Edit Med Log
 option.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The Kill condition was removed from the "AINFUSING" index when the 
 PATIENT (#.01) or ACTION DATE/TIME (#.06) fields are modified in the
 BCMA MEDICATION LOG (#53.79) file.  Post install routine PSB381P will
 also clean up any "AINFUSING" indexes where the bag is completed.

 NOTES:
 ======
 Routine APSPFUNC called from PSBOBL, PSBOBZ and PSBOXA are Indian Health
 Services only routines and will display as an XINDEX error when installing
 this patch in VA Accounts.  This functionality was introduced by patch
 PSB*3.0*42. This enhancement is intended to enable the BCMA application to
 recognize whether it is operating in the Indian Health Service (IHS) or
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) environment, and respond by
 recognizing and displaying the patient identifier appropriate to the
 environment. This will enable a single version of BCMA to be maintained by
 VHA and yet be installed and operate in a "plug and play" fashion in an
 IHS or Tribal facility running Resource and Patient Management System
 (RPMS).
