  Installation of BCMA Patch PSB*3.0*97 may cause your WMA application to
  stop functioning as you would expect it to. In order for the WMA devices
  to work properly with PSB*3.0*83/97 installed, you must contact 
  CareFusion, the WMA vendor, to obtain the most current version of the WMA
  software.
  
  Please test this patch thoroughly in your TEST environment before 
  installing into PRODUCTION. If you encounter any issues with the WMA
  application, please report them to CareFusion.
  
 A hard error can occur in the BCMA client, while using the new Select from
 Body Diagram button, due to passing the Division's IEN instead of the 
 expected Station Number the user logged into.
  
 A hard error can occur in the BCMA client application with a new button
 provided that displays a Body Site Image for selecting body location of
 transdermal type medications.
  
 A hard error can occur in the BCMA Parameters client application, when
 trying to save the list and body diagram, after placing a green dot on the
 feet that is near the bottom of the diagram.
  
 The Legend area in two BCMA reports were reporting the wrong initials for
 nurses that provided care to the patient.  See below ticket I12215629FY17

 I11918189FY17 - R2 V23 CP- Central Plains BCMA Coordinator reporting 
                 some issues with the PSB*3*83 Patch/GUI. 
  
  Problem:
  ========
  BCMA was passing the IEN instead of the Station Number of the division.
  VistA found a valid station number matching that IEN and returned a blank
  Body Chart with no locations, as the Division was not a valid Division at
  this site and therefore was not configured with a body site list.
  
  Subsequently clicking OK on this display caused a hard error and shut
  down the BCMA client.
  
  Resolution:
  ===========
  The fix to this issue is made via a new BCMA client GUI being released
  along with this patch and will correct both issues observed.  The issues 
  are corrected by passing of the station number instead of the IEN, and  
  in the event a valid division has an empty body site list, the OK button
  will be disabled.
  
  
 R12172061FY17  - Priority - BCMA Exception Error with new patch install
  
  Problem:
  ========
  BCMA Parameters GUI can issue error and shutdown if a Green Dot is down
  near the bottom edge of the body diagram on the feet and the user selects
  the Save List button.
  
  Resolution:
  ===========
  This fix to this issue is made via the new BCMA Parameters GUI being
  released along with this patch and corrects some internal coordinate 
  values when saving the location of the green dot on the body image.
  
  
 I12215629FY17 - User states that they are experiencing a bug in version 
                 3.3.83 of the BCMA application which is resulting in
                 nurses initials being incorrectly "changed" in the system.
  
  Problem:
  ========
  1. BCMA Medication Administration History report was printing an extra
  user line in the Legend of the report, which had mismatched name and
  initials.
  
  2. BCMA Medication Therapy report was not printing the User name and 
  Initials, in the Legend, for the associated administrations to
  medications that have been Removed.
  
  
  Resolution:
  ===========
  1. Corrected a new call when finding associated administrations to
  medications that have been Removed, to not print twice, once with correct
  information and again with incorrect information.
  
  2. Corrected by retrieving the user's IEN during the finding of the
  associated administration to a medication that has been Removed call.  
  Followed by getting the user's initials and name for printing in the
  Legend.
