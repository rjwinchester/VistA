 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. I9592038FY16 - Frequently, BCMA users are not able to access the BCBU
                   database
    
 Problem: 
 --------
 Frequently, BCMA users are not able to access the BCBU database. This result
 in local IT support spending time to resolve what should be a minor issue.
 However, the fix is not always simple or straight forward. Typically, the
 problem is that the user has had a Verify Code change since they last
 accessed a contingency. Normally, doing a User Initialization does not
 resolve the issue and IT support has to either replace the database or
 manually give the user a new Verify code on the contingency computer.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the routines ALPBGEN, ALPBGEN1 and ALPBGEN2 to remove some
 unnecessary restrictions for sending a user update over to the BCBU
 workstation. For example, if a user was terminated in the main VistA System
 it would not be sent to the BCBU workstation. This caused terminated users
 in the main VistA System to remain active in the BCBU workstation.
   
  
 2. I8652828FY16 - Getting ALERT BCBU Contingency Error 46364090 / Missing HLL
                   Links Array Med-Log
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 In a multi-divisional BCBU configuration all Divisions are required to have
 an HL7 Logical Link associated. When a division is missing the association an
 alert is generated for every transaction that is supposed to go to the BCBU
 workstation for that division. The problem is that the Alert does not identify
 which division is missing the Logical Link, which makes it hard for the users
 to identify the source of the problem and resolve it. Furthermore, the fact 
 that the Alert does not identify which patient was being processed when the 
 issue happened makes it hard to troubleshoot and fix the problem as well.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the routine ALPBCBU to include the site number and the patient DFN
 number in the Alert subject. This way users will know exactly which division
 and the patient that was being processed when a BCBU Alert is generated due to
 an error. 
   
 Here is how the Alert text will be modified:
   
  Before: BCBU Contingency Error
          Missing HLL Links Array Med-Log
  
  After:  BCBU Contingency Error / Site: 442 / DFN: 1930382
          Missing HLL Links Array Med-Log
  
  
 3. I6161931FY16 - Received the error $ZE= <UNDEFINED>ZPD+5^IVMPREC8 *HLFS
    I16851052FY18 - Undefined: GENACK+10^RGADTP *HL("MID") 
  
 Problem: 
 -------- 
 When an HL7 message is received from an Income Verification Match (IVM) Center
 containing demographics data for a patient that includes a date of death the
 BCBU application is automatically invoked if such patient has active inpatient
 orders. Many other subscribing applications are automatically invoked by the 
 same process and they all share the same local variables from the invoking
 process. The routine ALPBINP was incorrectly killing HL7 local variables such
 as HL, HLA, HLCS, HLCTR and HLFS, which were being used by other applications
 and in these two specific incidents reported caused the Income Verification
 Match (IVM) and Registration applications to error out.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the routine ALPBCBU to initialize the variables HL, HLA, HLECH
 and HLQ and also modified the routine ALPBINP to no longer kill the HL7
 variables HLCS, HLCTR and HLFS.
  
 NOTE: This fix could not be tested in a development or an SQA environments
       because it requires an incoming HL7 message from an external entity.
     
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Kansas City VAMC
 Upstate NY HCS   
   
  
 Pre-Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 This patch required Fileman v22.2 to be installed before this patch can be
 installed. Therefore it is important that the BCBU workstations where the
 this patch will be installed already have been updated with the latest
 version of Fileman (v22.2).
  
   
 Patch retrieval Instructions: 
 ----------------------------
 1. Retrieve the KIDS distribution host file. This patch will be
    distributed in a host file. The name of the host file is:
  
         PSB_3_102.KID
     
     Files can be obtained from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of
     the OI Field Offices. The preferred method is to retrieve the file
     using Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from
     DOWNLOAD.VISTA.DOMAIN.EXT, which will transmit the file from the first
     available server. Alternatively, sites may elect to retrieve the file
     from a specific OI Field Office.
   
     OI FIELD OFFICE     FTP ADDRESS                    DIRECTORY 
     Hines               DOMAIN.EXT

 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------- 
 The BAR CODE MED ADMIN (BCMA) users should not be using the application
 while this patch is being installed. It should take less than 2 minutes
 to install this patch.
   
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
    2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
       Installation menu.  From this menu, you may select to use the
       following options: 
       when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the patch # PSB*3.0*102:
  
         a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch 
            routines, DDs, templates, etc.
  
         c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
  
    4. From the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
       choose the patch to install.
  
    5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//' respond NO.
  
    6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//' respond NO.
  
    7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
  
 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the patch
 number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
 3.0;BAR CODE MED ADMIN;**[PATCH LIST]**;MARCH, 2004
    
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run to
 compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch description.
  
  
 Post-Installation Overview
 --------------------------
 None. 
  
   
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install).
 The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract
 PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function
 "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up routines onto
 the VistA System. 
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of the
 PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line Routine
 Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the PSB*3.0*102
 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the Routines will no
 longer contain the designation of patch PSB*3.0*102 in the patch list section
 on line 2.
