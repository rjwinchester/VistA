Subject: BCMA MED ADMIN HISTORY REPORT ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue:
  
 The Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Medication Admin History 
 report (also known as the Med Admin History (BCMA) report in CPRS) throws
 an <UNDEFINED> error (and causes CPRS to exit) when generated for a
 specific date range.
  
       
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 -------------------------------------------
 1) INC3683945 - AEU can't look at med admin history (BCMA) due to an 
                 error after inputting a date range
     dup INC3570947
     dup INC3507924
     dup INC4109840
     dup INC4866891
            
 Problem: 
 -------
 After the release of PSB*3*112 a new issue was introduced that causes the 
 BCMA Medication Admin History report to throw an <UNDEFINED> error. 
 Similarly, in CPRS, the Med Admin History (BCMA) report throws an 
 <UNDEFINED> error and then exits the application. The problem is specific
 to a patient with a PATCH medication that has a ONE TIME schedule (e.g.
 Start Date of D and End Date of D+1); after the PATCH is given on day D
 and marked removed on day D+1, the error occurs when the user runs the
 report for the date range D through D.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This patch prevents the error from happening when the BCMA Medication Admin
 History Report is run following the instructions above. The PSBOMH and
 PSBOMH1 routines have been modified to prevent the PSBAR array from 
 crashing when the subscript is undefined.
     
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital (Madison)
 VISN 2 - Upstate New York HCS
    
  
 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ----------------------------- 
 This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize potential
 disruption to users. This patch should take less than 2 minutes to install.
   
 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
   
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the  
    Installation Menu.
  
 4. From the Installation menu, select Backup a Transport Global and when
    prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch PSB*3.0*116. This option
    will create a backup message of any routines exported with this patch.
    It will not backup any other changes such as DDs or templates. If for
    any reason the patch is to be rolled back, this backup will be required
    to restore the patch's routine(s) to the pre-installation version(s).
  
 5. From the Installation Menu, you may elect to use the following options.
    When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch: PSB*3.0*116 
  
     a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
     
     b. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to print only 
        a summary of the patch, to print a summary of the patch and the
        routines in the transport global, or to print only the routines in
        the transport global.
  
     c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed. (It compares all components of this patch's routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
   
 6. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    choose the patch to install.
  
 7. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
    NO//" respond NO.  
   
 8. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
  
 Installation Verification:
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
 ;;3.0;BAR CODE MED ADMIN;**[Patch List]**;Mar 2004
  
 The Calculate and Show Checksum Values option [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in this patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
