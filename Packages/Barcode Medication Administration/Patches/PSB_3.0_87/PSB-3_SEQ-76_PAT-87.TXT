  Installation of BCMA Patch PSB*3.0*83 may cause your WMA application to
  stop functioning as you would expect it to. In order for the WMA devices
  to work properly with PSB*3.0*83 installed, you must contact CareFusion,
  the WMA vendor, to obtain the most current version of the WMA software.
  
  Please test this patch thoroughly in your TEST environment before 
  installing into PRODUCTION. If you encounter any issues with the WMA
  application, please report them to CareFusion.
  
  
  For retrieval and installation instructions for BCMA GUI, please see the
  Client Installation Instructions section in patch PSB*3*83.
  
 **************************************************************************
  
 PSB*3*87 will enhance the BAR CODE MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION (BCMA) Backup
 System (BCBU) to support Medications Requiring Removal (MRR). The Backup
 System will be able to store the Removal times and duration of
 administration associated with each medication order.
  
 This patch will add two new fields to the ORDER NUMBER (#53.702) 
 sub-file  under the BCMA BACKUP DATA (#53.7) file.  The two new fields 
 are the REMOVE TIMING (#7.4) field and DURATION OF ADMINISTRATION (#7.5) 
 field. These fields implement changes that will support enhancements to 
 Medical Administration Record(s) MAR reports in the BCBU application.
  
 The MAR reports will print each Scheduled Removal times for MRR 
 medications in the Grid in the same manner as Admin times.  The Remove
 times will appear below the current scheduled Administration time in the
 Grid and will be separated by the Label "Remove" in the times column.  
 Asterisks will print in the body of the Grid in each Removal action box
 for removal times that are not valid per the Date in that column heading.
  
 In the BCMA BACKUP DATA (#53.7) file, under the ORDER NUMBER (#53.702) 
 sub-file, there are three new fields that have been added to the MED LOG 
 DATE/TIME (#53.70213) multiple.  These new fields are ASSOC. MED LOG GIVE 
 DATE/TIME (#4), ASSOC. MED LOG GIVE ENTERED BY (#5) and ASSOC. MED LOG 
 GIVE STATUS MSG (#6). These fields are being added for saving associated 
 Give information when a Remove action has occurred.  This allows the MAR 
 reports and also the Display Order reports to print the Med Log history 
 and show both the Removals and their associated Gives.
  
 The MAR reports will also no longer display the Order number of the
 medications being administered.
  
 Please refer to the BCMA Backup System (BCBU) Installation Guide for 
 PSB*3*87 for installation details.

 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 ------------------------------
 PSPO00002876: National BCMA contingency (BCBU) shows order number that is 
               confused with units to be administered.
 PSPO00003142: Contingency data remains inaccurate - missing medications on
               all Clinic patients.
  
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ----------------------------
 1. INC000001275373 - BCMA Contingency Plan - Other BCBU Issue:
                      remove 'Order:' section from MAR
       I9846294FY16(d) 
  
 2. I6768353FY16    - BCBU - One contingency computer incorrectly reporting
                      Missed Meds.
  
  
 REMEDY OVERVIEW
 ---------------
 1. INC000001275373 - BCMA Contingency Plan - Other BCBU Issue: remove
                      'Order:' section from MAR.
  
 Problem:
 --------  
 The BCBU MAR currently displays the order number for the 
 medication being administered in the 'Order:' section of the
 report.  At times the order number contains the letter 'U' which
 has caused confusion regarding the amount of units to give to a
 patient. 
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine ALPBFRM1 has been modified to remove the 'Order:'
 section from the BCBU MAR.  The medication type will remain on
 the same line.  This change will only correct future medication
 orders on the BCBU MAR that are done after the installation of
 this patch.
  
  
 2. I6768353FY16 - BCBU - One contingency computer incorrectly reporting 
                   Missed Meds.
  
 Problem:
 --------  
 The BCBU divisional initialization option [PSB BCBU INIT WRKSTN DIV] has a
 defect which is only affecting clinic orders in BCBU.  A site found that
 the data that is reflected in BCBU was determined to be incorrect for all
 patients listed in the clinic at the time.  It took sending single patient
 updates using the [PSB BCBU INIT SINGLE PT] option in BCBU, some of which
 required multiple single patient initializations, to bring the data
 current.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The BCBU routines ALPBIN and ALPBIND were updated to verify if a clinic 
 is within a particular division.

 Uninstall Instructions
 ----------------------
 This procedure assumes that a backup copy of the routines was done during 
 the installation process.
 Only routines are backed-up; other components such as DDs, templates, 
 protocols, options or HL7 components are not backed up. 
  
 To back out the patch, restore the backup copy saved in the MailMan 
 message. This action will restore the routines to the state before 
 installing the PSB*3*87 patch.
  
 Note: In order to completely back out all components, development will 
 make a patch available that will restore non-routine components to 
 pre-PSB*3*87 state.
