Subject: MISSING DOSE REPORT BY DIVISION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Patch PSB*3.0*100 enables Pharmacy personnel to display unresolved 
 missing dose requests for a single division within a multidivisional site 
 when using the Missing Dose Followup [PSB MISSING DOSE FOLLOWUP] option 
 in VistA. Division selection is enabled when the site is defined as 
 multidivisional in the MAS PARAMETER (#43) file. If the site is 
 multidivisional, then the user can select one or all divisions when 
 displaying missing dose requests. If the site is not multidivisional, 
 then there is no change to existing functionality; reporting procedures 
 and results for single-division sites are not affected by this patch.
  
 If a user at a multidivisional site enters "O" (One) at the "Do you want 
 'A'll Divisions or just 'O'ne Division:" prompt, then VistA displays
 the "Select Division:" prompt. The prompt defaults to the division used 
 for VistA log in. The user can accept the default or enter "?" to choose 
 from a list of site divisions. The divisions available for selection are 
 those in the MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION (#40.8) file. If a multidivisional 
 user selects all divisions, then missing dose requests for all divisions 
 in the MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file are displayed.
  
 Currently, the Missing Dose Followup option lists missing dose requests 
 for patients across all divisions at a multidivisional site. Users must 
 manually search through multiple screens to select patients from their 
 division who require follow-up. This enhancement adds the new DIVAS cross 
 reference for the BCMA MISSING DOSE REQUEST (#53.68) file, enabling the 
 Missing Dose Followup option to sort and present file entries by status 
 (Unresolved) and division. At the end of the installation process, this 
 file will be re-indexed with the new cross reference. No user action is 
 required to start the re-indexing operation.
  
 By filtering the display of missing dose requests by division, this 
 modification helps ensure the timely reporting and administration of 
 missed medication doses.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 Review the Pre-Installation Instructions provided before beginning 
 installation of the patch.
  
 At the end of the installation process, the routine PSB3P100 runs to 
 re-index the entire BCMA MISSING DOSE REQUEST (#53.68) file with the 
 'DIVAS' New-Style Regular cross reference. Once the process is completed, 
 the routine is deleted automatically. No additional user action is
 required for this process to complete.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system, although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes 
 to install.
 The site/region should save a copy of the DIVISION (#.04) field and the 
 STATUS (#.07) field from the BCMA MISSING DOSE REQUEST (#53.68) file.

 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of this patch, it is not recommended for 
 backout. However, in the event that a site decides to back out this 
 patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit 
 a CA Technologies Service Desk Manager (CA SDM) ticket. The development 
 team will then assist with the backout process.
  
 The site/region should also save a copy of the DIVISION (#.04) field and 
 the STATUS (#.07) field from the BCMA MISSING DOSE REQUEST (#53.68) file.
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the PSB routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the PSB routines have been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain 
 the designation of patch PSB*3.0*100 on line 2 in the patch list section. 
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out; it does not confirm that other patch component changes 
 have been backed out.
  
 The site/region must manually restore the two fields from file #53.68 
 modified by this patch.
