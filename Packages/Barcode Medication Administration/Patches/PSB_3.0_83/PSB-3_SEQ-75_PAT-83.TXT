 **************************************************************************
  
 The Clinical Ancillary Services Development-Delivery of Pharmacy 
 Enhancements (CAS DDPE) project addresses several NSRs, which center 
 around providing a means for properly handling Transdermal Medications 
 Requiring Removal (MRR) beyond the current medications of dosage form 
 Patch.  These enhancements interface with Inpatient Pharmacy package, 
 which will be storing Scheduled Removal Times, for inpatient orders that 
 are designated as MRR type medications.  See associated patches PSS*1*191 
 and PSJ*5*315 for details on how MRR medications are designated.
  
 Features of the BCMA GUI provided by this project are listed below.
  
  1. Change the current GUI Unit Dose tab column labeled "Admin Time" to 
     "Next Dose Action".
  
  2. The "Next Dose Action" column will now contain both the next admin
     times for scheduled administrations as well as the next Removal time
     for MRR type medications. The initial login to BCMA will sort the
     Unit Dose tab in ascending order by this column, so older actions for
     medications will be at the top of the VDL display.
  
       a. The Next Action of an administration will contain the word "DUE,"
          followed by the scheduled admin time in the standard date@admin
          time format currently in use.
       b. The Next Action of a removal will contain the word "REMOVE,"
          followed by the scheduled removal time in the standard
          date@time format.
       c. The Next Action of an administration that is past due to be
          given will contain the word "LATE," followed by the scheduled
          admin time in the standard date@admin time format currently in
          use.                
       d. The Next Action of a removal that is past due to be removed will
          contain the words "LATE-RM," followed by the scheduled removal 
          time in the standard date@time format.
  
  3. Change the current GUI column labeled "Wit" to "Alert".
  
  4. The Alert column will still have the ability to display the Witness 
     required icon and will also be able to display a new Remove icon.  
       a. The icon is displayed only for MRR type meds that were Given and
          whose next Action is for Removal.
  
  5. Early/Late warnings will also be associated with medications being 
     removed early or late using the same early/late time range that is
     used for early or late medication admins.
       a. User comments are prompted for and stored upon continuing with
          the Early/Late removal action.
  
  6. Variances will also be tracked for Early/Late Removals in the same 
     manner as they are currently for Early/Late medication
     administrations and will appear on the Medication Variance Log report.
  
  7. BCMA Medication Administration History (MAH) report will now print
     the associated Give, which was previously overwritten by the Remove
     action, chronologically after the Remove for the Print by Patient 
     report. The Print by Ward report will now include the count of
     Removals scheduled for the report time period.
  
  8. BMCA Medication Log will now show the historical Give date/time below 
     the current status of the medication, which shows the Remove
     date/time.
  
  9. BCMA Missed Medications report will also show Removals that were
     missed or up and coming, similar to how missed Gives are currently
     notated.  The column heading has been changed from "Admin Date/Time"
     to "Missed Date/Time".
  
 10. BCMA Display Order report now includes the Removal Times for this
     order directly below the current Admin Times.
  
 11. BCMA Medication History report now includes a prior Give line item
     directly below the current status line item of Remove (RM). The Remove
     last action on this administration overwrites the Give information and
     was no longer printing on this report.  This information is now being
     retrieved from the Audit log and printed on this report.
  
 12. BCMA Due List report now includes Remove Times on the report below 
     the admin times that are due per Medication.
  
 13. BCMA Coversheet Medication Overview report and the Coversheet 
     Expired/DC'd/Expiring Orders report will now include Missed-Removals 
     and Removals on the reports.
  
 14. BCMA Medication Log report changed the heading from "Inj Site" to 
     "Body Site".  The  Medication detail body text will display the proper
     label of "Inj Site:" or "Derm Site:" just prior to the name of the
     Body site for that medication.
  
 15. BCMA Medication History Heading line changed from "Injection Site" to
     "Body Site".
  
 16. A body site diagram will be added to the BCMA Parameter GUI client 
     application for the purpose of showing a dot on the body diagram that
     is associated with the text representation of that site location on
     the body.
  
 17. The BCMA Parameter GUI client application has access to a new kernel 
     parameter titled in GUI application as "Dermal Site History Max
     Days:".  This allows the BCMA coordinator the ability to control how
     many days of prior dermal body site location history will appear, when
     a clinician is giving a new dermal medication that is prompting for a
     body site location.
  
 18. The Orders for MRRs With Removal Properties [PSS MRR ORDERS DIAGNOSTIC
     RPT] option, found on the Pharmacy Data Management [PSS MGR] menu, 
     will also be placed on the Bar Code Medication Administration Manager
     [PSB MGR] menu.
  
  
 NOTE: Non-standard schedules such as DAY@HHMM, HHMM, or other Odd
       schedules, are not capable of calculating removal times due to a
       lack of a Frequency.  Regardless of the Prompt for Removal in BCMA
       code value they will not prompt for removal in BCMA and must be
       avoided.

 PSPO00001978: BCMA does not prompt user to remove a transdermal patch when
               the removal time differs from the next administration time. 
 PSPO00002222: IV bag that should have been invalid due to provider comment
               changes was inadvertently made available for infusion.
 PSPO00002333: BCMA Missed Medications report does not include orders with
               a status of "Renewed".
 PSPO00002803: Scanning of barcode on medication package focuses the default
               to the "OK" button and removes warning screen from view
 PSPO00003011: Clinic order medication does not appear on the VDL until the
               exact time of the medication start date/time
  
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ----------------------------
 INC000000216580 - No "G" for a given patch dose.
    INC000000218095(d) - Patch removal deletes
                  original administration.
 INC000000960057 - Provider Comments IV Bag Parameter has no
                   effect on IV Bag Administration
    I9879098FY16(d)
 INC000000984066 - Orders with a Status of Renewed don't display on
                   the Coversheet
    I9890583FY16(d)
 INC000001224198 - The "Invalid Medication Lookup" and "Scanned
                   Drug Not Found" pop-ups have the focus set to
                   "OK"
    I9891800FY16(d)
  
 1. INC000000216580 - No "G" for a given patch dose.
        INC000000218095(d)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In BCMA, when a patch is marked as removed using the right mouse click
    pop-up menu, the original administration disappears from the medication
    log. The only way to tell when the patch was originally placed is to look
    at the medication log for the date the patch was removed.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch will enhance the BCMA reports to show both Give and Remove 
    date/times that occurred after a Remove action was performed on an 
    administration time.
  
 2. INC000000960057 - Provider Comments IV Bag Parameter has no
                      effect on IV Bag Administration
       I9879098FY16(d)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Provider Comments IV Bag Parameter has no effect on IV Bag
    Administration.  Regardless of the setting of the parameter,
    a warning message will never display, and the bag will be
    allowed to be given. 
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Files BCMAParameters.pas and BCMAParameters.dfm of the BCMA
    Parameters GUI were modified to remove the Provider Comments
    parameter.  Because provider comments do not display in BCMA,
    there is no need for this parameter.  Provider Comments can be
    copied into Other Print Info/Special Instructions when finishing
    an order in Inpatient Meds.
  
 3. INC00000984066 - Orders with a Status of Renewed don't display on
                     the Coversheet
       I9890583FY16(d)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Orders with the STATUS (#28) field defined as "Renewed" in the UNIT
    DOSE (#55.06) sub-file, or a STATUS (#100) field defined as "Renewed"
    in the IV (#55.01) sub-file of the PHARMACY PATIENT (#55) file, don't
    display on the BCMA Coversheet.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    File oCoverSheet.pas of the BCMA GUI was modified to display
    orders with a Status of "Renewed"
  
  
 4. INC0000001224198 - The "Invalid Medication Lookup" and "Scanned
                       Drug Not Found" pop-ups have the focus set to
                       "OK"
      I9891800FY16(d)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The "Invalid Medication Lookup" and "Scanned Drug Not Found"
    pop-ups have the focus set to the "OK" button.  If the users
    scan an invalid medication, and then scan another medication,
    the 2nd scanning will close the pop-up window.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Files BCMA_Main.pas, BCMA_Objects.pas, BCMA_Util.pas, MultipleDrugs.pas
    and uFiveRights.pas of the BCMA  GUI were modified to no
    longer default the focus to the OK button.  The button can either be
    clicked on or tabbed to.
