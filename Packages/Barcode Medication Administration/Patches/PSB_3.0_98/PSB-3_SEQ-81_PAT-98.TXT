 CA OVERVIEW:
 ============
 1. I9891926FY16  - On Call Order not DC after BCMA Administration 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) IVP/IVPB tab continues
    to display orders on the Virtual Due List (VDL) with a Schedule Type of
    On Call after the order is administered, regardless of the setting of the
    Allow Multiple Admins for On-Call parameter.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBVDLPB was modified to no longer display orders with a
    Schedule Type of On Call on the IVP/IVPB for On Call orders when the 
    Allow Multiple Admins for On-Call parameter is set to no.
  
 2. I6974506FY16  - BCMA EXPIRED notation automatically applies to data
    field when a medication is delivered on a one time dose, but a BCMA EXPIRE
    DENIED is also appearing.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Bar code Medication Administration (BCMA) Display Order report
    displays both BCMA EXPIRED and BCMA EXPIRE DENIED in the data field
    of the Pharmacy Activity section when a one-time dose medication is
    administered. Only BCMA EXPIRED should display.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBML1 was modified to only call the expire routine once, correcting
    the issue of the BCMA EXPIRE DENIED displaying.
  
 3. I8904758FY16 - BCMA ORDER DETAILS DISPLAY ACTIVITY LOG "OLD DATA"
    IN INTERNAL FILEMAN FORMAT 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The BCMA Display Order report displays dates in the data field in internal
    Fileman format.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBODO was modified to display the date in external format.
  
 4.I9891557FY16 - <UNDEFINED>NONSTS+2^PSBOMT *PSBOCRIT
  
    Problem:
    --------
    An Undefined error occurs when the Medication Therapy report is run with no
    Schedule types selected.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBOMT was modified to not to protect against the undefined error
    when no schedule type is passed in.
