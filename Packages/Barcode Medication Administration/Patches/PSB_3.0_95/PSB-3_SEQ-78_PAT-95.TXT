Subject: PS EVSEND OR ITEM SEQUENCE CHANGE

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 There is an issue with the PSB BCBU RECEIVE protocol that is attached to 
 the PS EVSEND OR protocol. The PSB BCBU RECEIVE protocol kills off a 
 needed array used by the HMP XQOR EVENTS protocol. This patch changes 
 the order of operation of the PSB protocol so that it will be a sequence 
 number that always comes after the HMP protocol. The sequences assigned 
 to these two protocols should have them executed after all other 
 protocols attached to the PS EVSEND OR trigger protocol.
  
 **NOTE**
