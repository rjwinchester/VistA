Description:
============

 PSB*3.0*103 adds new option Report for Respiratory Therapy Medications
 [PSB RPT RESP THERAPY MEDS] to the Medication Administration Menu Pharmacy
 [PSB PHARMACY] menu in the Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA)
 package, enabling Respiratory Therapists to create a report that 
 identifies patients who need administration of orderable items that have
 been classified as Respiratory Therapy drugs. These patients are located
 throughout the hospital in critical care areas, medicine areas, surgery
 areas, and Behavioral Health. Currently, Respiratory Therapists must go
 bed-to-bed to find their patients. The new report provides the order
 number, patient name and location, medication name and dosage, and
 administration date and time, thus allowing the therapists to easily
 identify each patient so that they can administer treatment. This report
 obtains patient names and ward locations using the CN cross-reference from
 the Patient file (#2).
  
 Note: Orderable items are classified as Respiratory Therapy drugs in the 
 Pharmacy Data Management package using the Edit Orderable Items [PSS EDIT 
 ORDERABLE ITEMS] option.
  
 Note: PRN orders will not be displayed in the Respiratory Therapy 
 Medications report, since PRN items do not have a defined administration 
 time.
  
 During the post-installation phase, routine PSB3P103 attaches the new 
 option Report for Respiratory Therapy Medications [PSB RPT RESP THERAPY 
 MEDS] to the Medication Administration Menu Pharmacy [PSB PHARMACY] menu. 
 Routine PSB3P103 is deleted automatically at the end of patch 
 installation.

 Backout Procedure: 
 ------------------ 
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of this patch, it is not recommended for 
 backout, and a restore from a backup of the Transport Global should not 
 be attempted. However, in the event that a site decides to back out this 
 patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit 
 a help desk ticket. The development team will need to issue one or more 
 follow-on patches in order to comprehensively back out this patch, after 
 coordination with the VA Project Manager and COR.
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the PSB routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the PSB routines have been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain 
 the designation of patch PSB*3.0*103 on line 2 in the patch list section. 
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out; it does not confirm that other patch component changes 
 have been backed out.
