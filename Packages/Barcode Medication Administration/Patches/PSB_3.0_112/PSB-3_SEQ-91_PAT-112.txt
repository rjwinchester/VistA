 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 INC1697793 - BCMA med log and medication administration history reports
              display
          
 Problem: 
 --------
 Bath VA Medical Center reported a problem with the BCMA Medication Admin
 History report for patch medication orders. For certain situations the report
 omits a patch given action if the same patch removal date falls outside the
 date range selected to run the report. In the report example below run 
 on 08/30/2018, for the date range 08/27/18 thru 08/29/2018 the 'G0800' under
 the 08/29/2018 column would not be displayed because the patch applied on
 08/29/2018 was already removed on 08/30/2018 and 08/30/2018 was not included
 in the report date range.

  TESTING BCMA PATCH ISSUE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
         
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the VistA code responsible for generating the report content to check
 the 'Given' Date/Time when the 'Removal' Date/Time falls outside the date
 range selected for the report. If the 'Given' Date/Time is within the date
 range selected then the entry will be included in the report.
   
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed the routine PSBOMH1 at EN+5 and EN+9 to check for the 'Given' date
 when the 'Removal' date falls outside the date range selected for the report.

 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
 ;;3.0;BAR CODE MED ADMIN;**[Patch List]**;Mar 2004
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
