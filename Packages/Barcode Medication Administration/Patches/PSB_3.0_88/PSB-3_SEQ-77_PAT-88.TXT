    Patient Safety Issue:
    =====================
    
    PSPO #3160 and #3174
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Bar code Medication Administration (BCMA) Due List Report does not
    display Intravenous Piggy Back (IVPB) orders  with an Inpatient Pharmacy
    Status of "On Call".
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBMLVAL was modified to include orders with a STATUS (#100)
    of "On Call" in the IV SUB-FILE (#55.01) of the PHARMACY PATIENT (#55) file.
  
 2. INC000001100985 - Missed Medication Report shows missed administrations
     
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Missed Medication Report incorrectly displays past administrations as
    missed when an order's Administration Times are edited at least 1 day
    after the start date of the medication, and the date/time of the edit are
    not included in the time frame of the report.  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBOMM2 was modified to take into account all edits made for 
    Administration Times, and properly display them on the Missed
    Medications report. 
  
 3. R7187594FY16 - Need to Add BCMA IEN Search option to Pharmacy Menu
  
    Problem:
    --------

    IEN numbers code in VISTA Pharmacy, found at SCANNER^PSBMLTS.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Menu option BCMA Drug IEN Synonym Check [PSB DRUG IEN CHECK] was created.
    Post install routine PSB388P will add the option to the Medication 
    Administration Menu Pharmacy [PSB PHARMACY] menu.

    Routine PSBRPC2 was modified to use the correct patient Internal Entry
    Number (IEN) when checking for IV bag history.
