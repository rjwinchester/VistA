Subject: eHMP FIX TO PATCH PSB*3*72 CODE LOSS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 PSB*3.0*94 is an emergency release but will have a compliance date of 
 6/10/2016 due to the controlled rollout of eHMP and the requirement to 
 install PSB*3.0*94 after PSB*3.0*79. Any site that has installed 
 PSB*3.0*79 in their Production account must install PSB*3*94
 immediately.  All other sites will install PSB*3.0*94 as part of the eHMP
 phased implementation.
  
 During the PSB*3.0*79 merge with PSB*3.0*72 a single line of code in the
 routine ^PSBML was not removed. The line not removed conflicts with
 another line that contains filters.
  
 This patch is solely for the purpose of removing this single line of 
 code. The purpose of one of the changes in PSB*3.0*72 was to only store
 the DOSE GIVEN (#.03) in the ADDITIVES (#53.796) and SOLUTIONS (#53.797)
 sub-files  of the BCMA MEDICATION LOG (#53.79) when the order is
 marked Given or Infusing.
  
 Removing the conflicting line restores this functionality.
  
 After the installation of the new routine, a modified version of the 
 Post processor PSB394P will run. This is a process similar to the 
 installation of the PSB*3.0*72 patch. This patch however has a reduced
 scope and should not take as long to run. 
  
 Please note this patch should be installed when NO BCMA Client users are on
 the system. Users should remain off the system until the post-processor
 has finished running. 
  
 This post processor has a reduced scope which should reduce the time
 to run, but its run time could still be more than 30 minutes. 
  
                        **IMPORTANT NOTE** 
  
 Patch PSB*3*94 is considered part of the Phased implementation 
 schedule for eHMP. As it CAN NOT be installed until PSB*3*79 is installed
  
 This patch needs to be installed after installing the HMP PREREQUISITE
 BUNDLE which contains the PSB*3.0*79 patch.
