Subject: BCMA GUI 2FA IMPLEMENTATION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch will update the log-in procedure to the Bar Code Medication 
 Administration (BCMA) Client and BCMA Site Parameters Graphical User 
 Interfaces (GUI) to use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) which will 
 require the use of a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card.
  
 In order to make the transition to 2FA, it was also necessary to upgrade 
 the BCMA Client and BCMA Site Parameters GUIs to Delphi version XE8 in
 order to implement the new Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker allowing
 compliance.
  
 This patch also distributes a new version of the Med Order Button 
 Dynamically Linked Library (DLL) file and a parameter that controls the
 version check inside of BCMA. 
  
 NOTE:  If BCMA and Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) are installed
 on the same workstation please make sure that OR*3.0*484 is installed as
 both CPRS and BCMA applications will use the same DLL for the Med
 Order Button.
  
 This patch no longer requires Broker patch XWB*1.1*29 (Shared Broker) to 
 be installed on a workstation to run the BCMA Client or BCMA Parameter 
 applications.
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 No associated tickets
  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 The Department of Veterans Affairs Cybersecurity Task Force has been tasked 
 by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Inspector General (IG) to 
 address identified material weaknesses. This task force has mandated that 
 all internal, user facing VA applications become 2FA compliant by April
 30, 2017. 
  
 In order to be compliant, applications are required to authenticate users 
 via PIV cards.  
  
 Note: Usernames and password will no longer be permitted for employees and
 contractors to access VA applications.  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 As part of the transition to 2FA, the BCMA Client and BCMA Site Parameters
 GUIs were upgraded to Delphi XE8 to allow access to the latest version of
 the RPC Broker implementing 2FA. This change also required a new version of
 the OrderCom.DLL which is used by the Med Order Button. This patch also 
 distributes a parameter, PSB MOB DLL REQUIRED VERSION, which is used by
 the BCMA GUI to determine which version of the Med Order Button DLL file 
 to use.
  
 *********************Notice*********************************************
 New OrderCom.DLL will be located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Vista\Common 
 Files and replace BcmaOrderCom.dll located within the BCMA directory.
