Subject: BCMA MEDICATION UPDATE ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues:
  
 1. The Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) GUI does not store the
    initials of the 2nd user who witnesses a high risk/high alert continuous
    intravenous (IV) order which has been marked stopped and then marked
    infusing again.
  
 2. If an IV order is marked as a missing dose, then as held or refused, then
    infusing, the medication log shows each ingredient of the infusing IV Order
    to have units of zero.
  
 3. When a multiple dose medication has been edited prior to administration,
    it will display on the Missed Meds report after administration.
  
 4. A PRN medication requiring a PRN Effectiveness does not display in the
    BCMA Clinical Reminders section if the patient is discharged and 
    re-admitted.
  
 5. The unsupported Documenting Backlog PRNs [PSB PRN DOCUMENTING] option
    needs to be marked out of order, and removed from the Bar Code Medication
    Administration Manager [PSB MGR] menu option.
  
 6. An error occurs when a site new to BCMA attempts to create their first 
    order.
  
 7. The patient lookup window sometimes lists the wrong patient when users
    are doing a search by the ward name and the first part of the ward name
    matches with a valid date.

 2. I9842129FY16 -  TPN shows 0 units for each ingredient - Med Log
 3. I9892810FY16 -  False missed med when Inpatient Pharmacy edits dispense
                    drug
 4. R12817870FY17 - PRN requiring effective is not showing on BCMA Clinical
                    Reminders

 6. I6216135FY16 -  <UNDEFINED>RESETADM+7^PSBUTL error in BCMA
 7. I10181534FY16 - Extra Data populated when pulling by Ward
  
  
 1. I9892136FY16   - 2nd Witness Initials not stored
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The second witness' information is not stored in the ADMIN WITNESSED BY
    (#.29) field of the BCMA MEDICATION LOG (#53.79) file when an IV bag
    with a high risk/high alert medication is marked stopped and then
    infusing again.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBML2 was modified to remove the first witness' information
    and store the second's information in the ADMIN WITNESSED BY (#.29) 
    field. The first user's information will be preserved in the AUDIT LOG
    sub-file (#53.799).
  
 2. I9842129FY16  - TPN shows 0 units for each ingredient - Med Log
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a missing dose is requested for an IV order, then as held or refused,
    and then infusing, the Medication History report shows each ingredient of 
    the infusing IV Order to display units of zero. 
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBML2 was modified to store the correct units for each IV bag
    ingredient in the UNIT OF ADMINISTRATION (#.04) field of both the 
    ADDITIVES (#53.796) and SOLUTIONS (#53.797) sub-files.
  
 3. I9892810FY16 - False missed med when Inpatient Pharmacy edits dispense
    drug
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A multiple dose medication will incorrectly display on the BCMA Missed
    Medications report when the dosage form of the order was edited after
    a missing dose request is made on the order.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBML2 was modified to store the correct medication dosages
    in the DISPENSE DRUG (#53.795) sub-file when the edited order is
    administered. 
  
 4. R12817870FY17 - PRN requiring effective is not showing on BCMA Clinical
                    Reminders
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A PRN medication requiring a PRN Effectiveness does not display on the
    BCMA Clinical Reminders if the patient is discharged and re-admitted.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBPRN was modified to display the order under the BCMA Clinical 
    Reminders when the patient is discharged and re-admitted, as long as the
    order falls within the PRN Documentation parameter.
  
 5. I10114492FY16 - Mark Documenting Backlog PRNs option OOO
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The unsupported Documenting Backlog PRNs [PSB PRN DOCUMENTING] option
    needs to be marked out of order and removed from the Bar Code Medication
    Administration Manager [PSB MGR] menu option. This option runs a version
    2 routine in BCMA (currently on version 3), and should not be active
    on a nationally released menu option.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Post Install routine PSB399P will mark the Documenting Backlog PRNs
    option [PSB PRN DOCUMENTING] "out of order" and remove the option
    from the Bar Code Medication Administration Manager [PSB MGR] menu.
  
  
 6. I6216135FY16 - <UNDEFINED>RESETADM+7^PSBUTL error in BCMA
  
    Problem:
    --------
    An error occurs the first time an order is administered in BCMA.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBUTL was modified to properly record the first BCMA 
    medication administration.
  
  
 7. I10181534FY16 - Extra Data populated when pulling by Ward
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A BCMA user was attempting to pull data by ward. When data populated
    it listed patients that are not associated with the ward selected.
  
    The problem happened because the ward searched had a name that the first
    characters were similar to a date (e.g., 8-8, 10-11, etc.). The routine  
    PSBMLLKU (line tag PTLKUP) used to perform a Fileman lookup using all
    cross-references in the PATIENT file (#2). This lookup approach
    sometimes produced wrong entries because it would match with a date from
    the "E" x-ref (CV DATED EDITED) because for example "8-8" would trigger
    a match a 08/08/17 (current year) causing such patients to be included
    in the lookup result.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
  
    The code at the PTLKUP^PSBMLLKU was modified to only include the cross-
    references that are relevant to the patient lookup popup window (last 
    name, first name, SSN, ward, room and bed).

 Patch Installation:
  
    Note:
    -----
    Routine APSPFUNC called from PSBMLLKU are Indian Health Services (IHS)
    only routines and will display as an XINDEX error when installing
    this patch in VA Accounts.  This functionality was introduced by patch
    PSB*3.0*42. This enhancement is intended to enable the BCMA 
    application to recognize whether it is operating in the Indian Health
    Service (IHS) or Veterans Health Administration (VHA) environment, and
    respond by recognizing and displaying the patient identifier
    appropriate to the environment. This will enable a single version of
    BCMA to be maintained by VHA and yet be installed and operate in a
    "plug and play" fashion in an IHS or Tribal facility running Resource
    and Patient Management System (RPMS).
