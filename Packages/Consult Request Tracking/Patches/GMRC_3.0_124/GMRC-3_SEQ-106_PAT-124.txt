Subject: DECISION SUPPORT TOOL (DST): ADD COMMENT TO CONSULT AFTER SIGNING

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement ()

Description:
============

 Associated patches: Informational Patch GMRC*3.0*125
 
 When a consult order is signed if there is a DST ID number listed 
 in the Responses Multiple (#100.045) in the ORDER file (#100), this DST 
 patch will query the DST server and retrieve the detailed DST 
 information from the database and create a Consult Comment in the 
 REQUEST/CONSULTATION file(#123) that includes the structured consult 
 factor text to enable analytic reporting using the same approach as 
 Consult Tool Box (CTB).
 
 This patch includes a post-install routine, GMRC124P, that sets up access 
 to the DST Service and attaches the new GMRC SIGNED CONSULT DST Protocol 
 as an item to the OR EVSEND GMRC Protocol. Please see the Pre/Post-
 Installation Overview and the Post-Installation Instructions sections
 below for more details. 
 
 Informational Patch GMRC*3.0*125, contains instructions for System 
 Administrators to manually configure the SSL/TLS configurations. The 
 service will not function until the Cache Management Portal is configured 
 to allow SSL/TLS communication for the Web Server File.

 Patch Installation:
 
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The Post install has two automated steps that are performed by the 
 post-install routine GMRC124P. First the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) 
 and Context components for the DST Service are added respectively to the 
 WEB SERVER and WEB SERVICE files. Second the post-install routine will 
 add the GMRC SIGNED CONSULT DST Protocol as an Item to the OR EVSEND GMRC 
 Protocol (#101) trigger.
 
 The post processor GMRC124P will set the WEB SERVER and the WEB SERVICE 
 values for the DST GET ID SERVICE to the proper URL for the DST Server.
 The post processor will also add the GMRC SIGNED CONSULT DST Protocol to
 the system and then attach that as an Item to the GMRC EVSEND OR Protocol
 (#101)
 
 *Note please be aware the URL is broken into two sections. The Web 
 Address only goes into the WEB SERVER file, while the directory context, 
 the part beginning with "/" is entered in the WEB SEVICE File.
 Details to verify this information are in the Post Install Instructions.

 settings and what is installed, please change your local 
 configuration to match what is below. There should NOT be any need
 in production to change these values.
 
 VA FileMan 22.2
 Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES  
 Input to what File: WEB SERVER//          
 EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL//

 using VA FileMan. If there are differences between these 
 settings and what is installed, please change your local 
 configuration to match what is below. There should NOT
 be any need to change these values. 
 
 VA FileMan 22.2

 This should complete all Post-Install steps and verification.
 
 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------------
 The patch is only functional due to the connection to the 
 Protocol OR EVSEND GMRC. The protocol GMRC SIGNED CONSULT DST 
 is attached as an ITEM. To disable/remove this patch use 
 VA FileMan to edit the Protocol OR EVSEND GMRC and go to ITEM.
 On the ITEM you should see the protocol 
 GMRC SIGNED CONSULT DST. Select this protocol and then at 
 the Name prompt, use the "@" sign to signal to VA FileMan you 
 wish the Item removed. VA FileMan will ask you to confirm this choice. 
 
 VA FileMan 22.2
 Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES  
 Input to what File: WEB SERVER// PROTOCOL    (6625 entries)
 EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// ITEM
 1  ITEM   (MULTIPLE)
 2  ITEM TEXT
 CHOOSE 1-2:1 ITEM  (MULTIPLE)
 EDIT WHICH ITEM SUB-FIELD: ALL//
 THEN EDIT FIELD:
 
 Select PROTOCOL NAME: OR EVSEND GMRC     OE/RR => CONSULTS MESSAGE EVENT
 Select ITEM: GMRC SIGNED CONSULT DST// @ "Enter the "@" sign to delete"
   SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THE ENTIRE ITEM?  Y   "Enter Y for yes"  
 
 To verify you have removed this Item, use Inquiry on the 
 OR EVSEND GMRC protocol and confirm the 
 GMRC SIGNED CONSULT DST is no longer listed.
 Once removed this code is no longer active or called
 by any other function. If desired the code may be
 deleted, but this is unnecessary as the code is no
 longer being invoked by any process.
