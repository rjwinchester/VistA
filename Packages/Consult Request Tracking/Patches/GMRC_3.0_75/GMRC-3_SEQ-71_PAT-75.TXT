Associated patches: (v)GMRC*3*46   <<= must be installed BEFORE `GMRC*3*75'

Subject: NON-VA CARE HCPS HL7 INTERFACE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch creates Health Level 7 (HL7) protocols, applications, a 
 logical link, and routines to send and receive HL7 messages between VistA 
 and the Healthcare Claims Processing System (HCPS) in Austin for Non-VA 
 Care consults.
    
    
 Enhancements
 ============
    
 1. Created new HL7 components (protocols, applications, and a logical
    link) to support messages to HCPS.  REF-I12 (patient referral)
    messages are sent for new or resubmitted consults.  REF-I13 messages
    are sent for updates to consults (status changes, comments added,
    etc.).  REF-I14 messages are sent for cancelled and discontinued
    consults.
    
 2. Created new routines GMRCHL7H and GMRCHL7P to receive consult event
    messages and generate outgoing HL7 v2.5 REF messages.  Only consults
    with 'HCPS' in the SERVICE NAME (#.01) in REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5)
    will be transmitted to HCPS.
    
 3. Created new routine GMRCHL7I to process incoming HL7 v2.5 RRI (return
    referral information) messages.
    
 4. Modified GMRCGUIB and GMRCACMT routines to send an HL7 v2.5 REF
    message to HCPS when a user adds a comment to a Non-VA Care consult
    through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).
    
 5. Created new routine GMRC75P to add the 'HCPS,APPLICATION PROXY' user
    to the NEW PERSON (#200) file.

 New Service Requests (NSRs)
 ----------------------------
 20100117 - Expanded Fee Pilot - CPRS Integration
 Non-VA care services are initiated by VA providers as a component of 
 Veterans health care services. Having an automated link from CPRS, where 
 the initial requests are entered, to the Referral and Authorization 
 System (RAS), can assure more timely care for Veterans. In addition, VA 
 providers frequently have no insight into when Non-VA care is scheduled, 
 provided and completed. Integration from RAS to CPRS can serve to update 
 VA providers on patient status.
