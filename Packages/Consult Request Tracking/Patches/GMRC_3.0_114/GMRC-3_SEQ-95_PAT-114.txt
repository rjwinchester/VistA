    GMRC*3.0*114.

      any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow
      you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is

 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
 3.0;CONSULT/REQUEST TRACKING;**[Patch List]**; DEC 27, 1997
    
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run 
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of 
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the GMRC Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 GMRC*3.0*114 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch GMRC*3.0*114 in
 the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;3.0;CONSULT/REQUEST TRACKING;**[Patch List]**;DEC 27, 1997;Build 2

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.
