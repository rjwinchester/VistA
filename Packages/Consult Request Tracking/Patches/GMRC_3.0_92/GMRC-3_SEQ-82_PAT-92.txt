 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
      
 1.  I8300448FY16 - Add station Number to Inter-Facility Consults.
  
     Problem:
     --------
     GMRCIBKG computes the Station Number incorrectly.  When the Station
     Number is computed the function returns the 3rd piece which makes 
     STA equal to the IEN instead of the Station Number.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Waiver 394033 modified the process in GMRCIBKG to allow the correct
     Station Number to be passed.  The code from Waiver 394033 has been 
     incorporated into GMRCIBKG.  
  
  
 2.  I14588359FY17 - Hard error <UNDEFINED>PTERRMSG+28^GMRCIERR 
     *GMRCSITE("NAME")
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The hard error <UNDEFINED>PTERRMSG+28^GMRCIERR *GMRCSITE("NAME") 
     occurs sporadically when the IFC background job GMRCIBKG attempts to
     return the station number for a group mail message.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The routine GMRCIBKG has been modified to correctly return the Station
     Number so a mail group message can be created.  The routine GMRCIBKG
     will be corrected to return the correct Station Number instead of the
     IEN.
  
  
 3.  I10472783FY16 - Documentation change.
  
     Problem:
     --------
     If a user has a last name with 2 names without hyphenation there is a 
     potential for the spaces between the last names to be stripped out and
     the names to appear as one.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Documentation change to the CONSULT/REQUEST TRACKING USER manual 
     to clarify how a user with two last names should enter their names 
     for it to appear correctly. 
  
  
 4.  I10570396FY16 - Error received when attempting to transmit 
     Inter-Facility Consults.
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The hard error <UNDEFINED>EN+28^GMRCIERR *GMRCSITE("NAME") occurs
     sporadically when the IFC background job GMRCIBKG attempts to transmit
     to a remote facility.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Waiver 394033 modified the code at the site to allow the correct
     Station Number to be passed to avoid the hard errors.  The code 
     from Waiver 394033 has been incorporated into background routine
     GMRCIBKG to allow the correct Station Number to be passed.

  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
  2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
      Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the 
      following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch
      GMRC*3.0*92:
  
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not back
         up any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.
  
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
  4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
      choose the patch to install.
  
  5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',

  7.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch. It is imperative that you have performed a
 backup of the routine included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created. No
 data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no rollback
 strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch description.
