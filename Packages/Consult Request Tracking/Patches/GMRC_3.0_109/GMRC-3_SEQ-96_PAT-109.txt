Subject: CONSULT TOOLBOX INFORMATIONAL PATCH GUI ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
 This is an informational patch explaining changes in Consult Toolbox.
 NOTE: This patch is loaded on individual PC workstations via SCCM 
 software update push from local/regional OIT. 
 There is nothing that local sites can or need to do besides  communicate 
 Changes to the clinical users. No code changes were made to the Consult 
 application to accommodate these enhancements. 
 **************************************************************************
  
 This software was created by the Atlanta VA Medical Center in response to 
 a need to manage the process of consult management. During the life of a 
 consult, there are prescribed steps of actions to be taken, and there is 
 a need to be able track these steps at an individual patient level. 
 Additionally, there is a need to be able to understand the overall status 
 of consult management at a macro level, and identify specific services 
 needing attention or resources. Without opening and reading a patient 
 medical record, it is difficult to identify which patients have had which 
 scheduling steps completed.
  
 This software does several things. First, it makes it very easy for staff 
 to document actions completed quickly and consistently. Second, it uses 
 consistent verbiage to document these steps. Third, it eliminates the 
 need to take a second action or make a separate entry to track scheduling 
 steps. Fourth, this consistent verbiage allows software analysis of 
 records without needing to have software changes to VistA or CPRS.
  
 A separate process using corporate data warehouse queries and reports 
 allows creation of views showing such things as patients who have not had 
 first call, second call, scheduling letter sent or how much time has 
 passed between these events.
  
 Together, these allow tracking and managing consults without the need to 
 keep a separate list or other workflow to know which consults need 
 attention.
  
 Additional Information:
 -------------------- 
 The software installs in the PC at the Windows level, and resides in the 
 system tray. It watches keyboard and mouse activity, and comes to life 
 when certain conditions occur.
  
 The first is it only activates when the currently active windows title 
 "Receive Consult", "Add Comment to Consult" or "Discontinue Consult." 
 Otherwise it does nothing.
  
 The second is when the user initiates a trigger event when either of 
 these windows have the focus, then depending on the open window a menu 
 appears for the user to select the appropriate action, then the software 
 inserts the appropriate text into the comment box.
  
 The defined trigger is a right mouse click in the supported CPRS consult 
 actions.
