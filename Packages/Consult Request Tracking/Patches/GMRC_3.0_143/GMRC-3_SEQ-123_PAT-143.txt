Subject: STANDARDIZED EPISODES OF CARE (SEOC) UI AND API UPDATES (V1.9)

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

  
 **************************************************************************
 This is an informational patch explaining development of the Standardized 
 Episodes of Care (SEOC) application.
  
 NOTE: This patch is loaded to an internal VA hosting environment and will 
 be available for use within the VA network.
  
 There is nothing that local sites can or need to do. 
 **************************************************************************
  
 This software is a reference database for managing care bundles for use by
 Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) and other
 VA systems. Services are grouped together within the SEOC system into 
 bundles so that clinicians can add these bundles to patients consult 
 records in a standardized fashion, reducing the amount of time spent 
 manually entering consult instructions, and providing uniformity among 
 the patient records and across facilities for how patient care is 
 prescribed for similar complaints.
  
 These bundles group together one or more services that are preselected for
 different specialties to be added to the consult records. In addition, the
 clinician is provided with information regarding prescribing rules and
 preauthorization requirements, so they can make the most informed 
 decisions regarding patient care.
  
 Additionally, SEOC data will be accessible outside of the 
 VistA/Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) so that users of 
 downstream applications will be accessing the same data, and SEOC 
 descriptions, reducing the chances of discrepancies.
  
 Additional Information:
 -------------------- 
 The software is installed in the VA Austin Information Technology Center
 (AITC) environment, and is accessible via the VA intranet. An API is made
 available for downstream applications to access SEOC data in a JavaScript 
 Object Notation (JSON) format.
  
 **************************************************************************
 Version 1.9 provides updates to the user interface layer for the SEOC
 database consistent with business requirements. An updated API layer is 
 also included to support requirements of the UI.
  
 The Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) ser Interface (UI) for authorized 
 SEOC Administrators will be enhanced based on business priority. Updates 
 included in this build are:
  
 - the ability for both PRCT and REV to be included in the name of the 
   SEOC as appropriate 
  
 - the ability to view the SEOC PreCert VA Webpage which displays the 
   table listing of SEOCs and their billing codes updated with live 
   data
  
 - the abiltiy to sort the SEOCs in alphabetical order
  
 - the length of the total visits per payable service line has been
   increased from 3 to 4 digits
  
 - the ability to associate a frequency type to each frequency number is 
   now enforced
  
 - the length of the frequency number has been increased to 3 digits
  
 - functionality has been modified to ensure extra spaces are no longer 
   considered when checking for duplicate SEOC names
  
 - a list of acceptable characters has been implemented to ensure   
   consistency throughout the API and UI
  
 - the method for monitoring activity within the application has been 
   modified so users are not incorrectly logged out of the application for 
   inactivity
  
 - a confirmation pop-up box has been added after selecting Activate to 
   ensure the correct acitivation date was selected
  
 - the visits field at the payable service level has been modified to 
   accept a null value
  
 - updates to core libraries and settings have been made to maintain 
   consistency with VA standards
  
 - outstanding 508 and other defects have been remediated
