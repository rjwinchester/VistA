Subject: CANCELLED TO DISCONTINUED CONSULTS

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch contains a new routine that does the following:
 1.      An overnight TaskMan job called GMRC CHANGE STATUS X TO DC 
 will run for a period of time specified by a new parameter called CSLT 
 CANCELLED TO DISCONTINUED. Following the installation of this patch, that 
 period of time will be 31 days prior to today, and going back in time to 
 365 days prior to today. **NOTE: The GMRC CHANGE STATUS X TO DC option 
 should never be run from any menu. If that were attempted, the user will 
 receive a message "This option is only for use by TaskMan as an overnight 
 job"**
 2.      The overnight job will find consults that were cancelled in the 
 period defined in 1. above, and will discontinue those consults.
 3.      A new option called GMRC CX TO DC PARAMETER EDIT will be 
 installed by the patch. This option will allow users at VA sites to 
 change the timescale referred to in 1. above.
 4.      The patch will install an option in file #19.2 (OPTION 
 SCHEDULING) called GMRC CHANGE STATUS X TO DC. It will initially be 
 set to run at 11:00 PM every night.
 5.      A temporary file in the XTMP namespace will be created during the 
 overnight job. This file will contain details of every consult that was 
 discontinued. The file will be set to be purged after 60 days.

 Patch Installation:
  
 *****************************************
 DO NOT QUEUE the install of this patch.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Please see Pre-Installation Instructions and Post-Installation 
 Instructions below.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch creates a new index on file
 #123 (REQUEST/CONSULTATION) on the complete file. The index is called
 "ASTATUS".
  
 During a post-install process, it is necessary to add to the index all 
 existing consult records in file #123. In a production environment this 
 could go into the millions. The job of doing this is transferred into the 
 background using TaskMan, and the TaskMan job number will be displayed in 
 the install log. The job starts with the most recent consults and works 
 its way backwards. In order not to consume system resources 
 exhaustively, this background job will pause every 10,000 records, and 
 will hang for 10 seconds. 
  
 Please note that if any consults were to be created during the time that 
 the background job is running, the index will be updated for those new 
 consults since the data dictionary has already been changed at this point.
  
 PLEASE NOTE: Since the background job is processing the whole consult 
 file, depending upon the number of consults at any site, it could take up
 to 8 hours to finish.
  
 Also, for system administrators, the background job can be stopped as
 follows:

                Select Action (Task # 270120): ST  Stop task.
  
 This task has already started running, but it has been asked to stop.
 If the job is stopped a MailMan message will be sent to the installer. At 
 the end of the job, a MailMan message will be sent to the installer.
 In the event where the job is stopped, it can be run again by typing D 
 QUEUE^GMRC113P at the programmer prompt. The job will then pick
 up where it left off.
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select

 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 The patch includes a multi-valued parameter called CSLT CANCELLED TO
 DISCONTINUED. There are three fields in the parameter as follows:
  
   1. Is the overnight cancelled to discontinued job active? 
      Value is either "Y" or "N" and is defaulted to "N" in the patch.
   2. How many days back to start with? 
      Value is a number and can be 0 (zero) and is defaulted to 31 days in
      the post-install routine in this patch.
   3. How many days back to end with?
      Value is a number and can be 0 (zero) and is defaulted to 365 days in
      the post-install routine in this patch.
  
 An overnight job called GMRC CHANGE STATUS X TO DC is scheduled
 by the post-install routine to use the index referred to in the
 Pre-Installation Instructions above, find consults that were cancelled in
 the date range indicated by values 2. and 3. above (by default 31 days 
 back to 365 days back), and discontinue them.
  
 The overnight job is scheduled to run at 11 PM. This setting can be 
 changed by appropriate persons by editing the GMRC CHANGE STATUS X TO DC
 schedule in file #19.2 (OPTION SCHEDULING).
  
 In order to change any values in the CSLT CANCELLED TO
 DISCONTINUED parameter, the patch installs a new option for this
 purpose. It is called GMRC CX TO DC PARAMETER EDIT.
  
 After installation, or when the overnight job is set to run, the "How 
 many days back to start with" parameter should be set to 91.
  
 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------
 Backout Routines:
 This patch contains two GMRC routines, one being the post-install. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between
 development team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA
 personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routine in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of 
 install). The message containing the backed-up routine can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed-up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 Go to the Backup of Patch_GMRC*3.0*113 message in Mailman. 
 At the Enter message action prompt, enter "X" to "Xtract PackMan" 
 At the Select PackMan Function prompt enter the number 6 to Install/Check 
 Message. 
 At the end of this process the pre-patch routines are restored.
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
 ----------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by the fact that the two 
 routines will have disappeared since they are both new.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
     
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines
 included in this patch prior to installation.
    
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
    
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
    
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
