Subject: DECISION SUPPORT TOOL (DST) CACHE SSL/TLS ENCRYPTION SETUP

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 When a consult order is signed if there is a DST ID number listed 
 in the ORDER file (#100), this DST patch will query the DST server 
 and retrieve the detailed DST information from the database and 
 create a Consult Comment in the REQUEST/CONSULTATION file(#123) 
 that includes the structured consult  factor text to enable 
 analytic reporting using the same approach as 
 Consult Tool Box (CTB).
 
 This Information only patch guides the setup for enabling DST to
 communicate through an encrypted connection.
 
 *NOTE: Unless the instructions in this patch are followed
 the features and functions in patch GMRC*3.0*124 will not function. 
 
 In order for patch GMRC*3.0*124 to connect to the DST servers
 it is necessary to add SSL/TLS encryption to the Cache Management
 Portal. This MUST be done for ALL nodes. The following instructions 
 will guide a system administrator through this process.
   
  
 The instructions for Cache 2014 and 2017 are slightly different - see 
 step 12 below.
  
 *NOTE*- Private key type RSA is automatically checked.  Do not change.
    
 Steps:
    1. Access the Cache Management Portal using either the appropriate
    URL for the site or the link via the Cache Cube
    2. Navigate to the System > Security Management > SSL/TLS 
    Configuration
    3. If a configuration called "encrypt_only_all" already exists then 
    use the Edit option to ensure the configuration is correct
    4. If no "encrypt_only_all" configuration exists use the "Create New 
    Configuration" option
    5. Configuration Name: encrypt_only_all
    6. Description: encrypt only all for DST
    7. Enable: Ensure check box is checked
    8. Type: Client radio button should be selected
    9. Peer Certificate Verification level: None radio button should be 
    selected
    10. File Containing Trusted Certificate: Leave Blank
    11. This Client Credentials: Leave entire section blank, see NOTE above
    12. Cryptographic settings for Protocols: For Cache 2014, TLSv1 should 
    be checked, uncheck other boxes
    For Cache 2017, check TLSv1.0, uncheck other boxes
    13. Enabled ciphersuites should remain default as shown below
    Cache 2014 - TLSv1:SSlv3:!ADH:!LOW:!EXP:@STRENGTH
    Cache 2017 - ALL:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXP:!SSLv2
    14. Save configuration. *Note test option will not work.
