Description:
============

 GMRC*3.0*89 provides the following enhancements to VistA:
  
 - Improves the process of managing pending consults by providing a 
 Consult Closure Tool that identifies consult requests that are 
 incorrectly left in Pending status and efficiently closes out those 
 consults. Current VistA tools provide lists of patients with pending 
 consults, but do not provide the ability to act on those lists directly. 
 The use of non-consult class Text Integration Utility (TIU) notes, 
 duplicate consult requests, and other workaround options to close out 
 consult requests leads to errors in consult completion rates and creates 
 redundant work during consult clean-up actions. Currently, the 
 'administrative completion' option in the Computerized Patient Record 
 System (CPRS) is the only method for closing out completed consults with 
 incorrect note titles. 
  
 This modification adds a new option [GMRC CONSULT CLOSURE TOOL] to
 the VistA Consult Management [GMRC MGR] menu. The Consult Closure Tool
 menu provides Edit Configuration and Run Configuration options.
  
 The Edit Configuration option is used to create or edit a consult closure 
 Configuration for a specified CPRS Team. The Configuration consists of 
 search parameters-including Clinic, Procedure, Service, and Order Item-to 
 be used in finding pending consults, as well as a list of existing TIU 
 notes to be used to close out the consults. The Run Configuration option 
 can then be used to: 1.) generate a printed list of patients 
 with pending consults that meet the parameters specified in the 
 Configuration and populate the Team list in CPRS, or 2.) immediately 
 resolve and close each of the pending consults by selecting a TIU note to 
 associate with it.
  
 - Provides a veteran's cell phone number and age (from the PATIENT file 
 (#2)) on the Consultation Form (SF-513) in CPRS. Many veterans do not 
 have a home phone number, so a cell phone number is vital information if 
 it is the primary contact number. Printing a veteran's age on the form 
 eliminates the chance of a math error being made by the provider when 
 considering treatment options that are reliant on age.
  
 -Enables a Consultation Form (SF-513) to be simultaneously printed to 
 printers at two different locations by adding a SECONDARY PRINTER field 
 (#689) to the REQUEST SERVICES file (#123.5) using the input template 
 [GMRC SETUP REQUEST SERVICE]. The modification allows both services to be 
 notified of a new consult at the same time, allowing representatives at 
 both locations to begin their reviews concurrently.

 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the GMRC routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the GMRC routines have been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain 
 the designation of patch GMRC*3.0*89 on line 2 in the patch list section.
  
 To ensure complete backout of the patch:
  
 1.      Inquire into the REQUEST SERVICES file (#123.5) to verify that 
 the SECONDARY PRINTER field (#689) does not exist. Inquire into the GMRC 
 CONSULT MAPPING file (#123.033) to verify the file does not exist.
  
 2.      Attempt to run all the GMRC CONSULT OPTIONS to verify that they 
 do not exist.
  
 3.      Attempt to edit the Print template GMRC CONSULT MAPPING to verify 
 that it does not exist.
  
 4.      View the GMRC SETUP REQUEST SERVICE Input template in file #123.5
