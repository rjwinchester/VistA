Subject: DECISION SUPPORT TOOL (DST) INFORMATIONAL PATCH FOR VERSION 1.0.07

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

  ******************************************************************************
  This is an informational patch for the Decision Support Tool application
  version 1.0.07. There is no VistA component to this new build.
  This patch is for informational purposes only and defines the scope of the
  changes that have been made including defects that have been resolved in DST. 
  ******************************************************************************
  
  Decision Support Tool version 1.0.07 has the following functionality changes
  and defect fixes:
  
 
 1. Story 1064322: DST will show all facilities with service availability
 within the search radius (Specialty Care = 100 miles, Primary Care/Mental
 Health = 40 miles).
 
 2. Story 1066852:  This update supports revisions to the GFI mapping table
 to support updates to the clinical service/stop code/SEOC mapping table from
 the DST Support Team in Office of Care Coordination.
 
 3. Story 1064828:    The DST dashboard will display a message on the
 facility list when no facilities are found so that notification to the user is
 provided that the search completed when no facilities are found.   
 
 4. Story 1025031: This is a technical story.  It fixes infrastructure
 changes to the local development setup for developers. The kubernetes
 deployment files were updated so that when running the app on the developer's
 machines, kubernetes only uses the environment variables for local development.
 
 5. Story 1023656: This update will allow the user to accept the default
 mapping or select the desired clinical service from the drop-down (typeahead)
 list on the DST dashboard.  It also adds a dropdown list capability to the user
 interface control to allow the user to browse the entire list of clinical
 services without having to enter a search string.
 
 6. Defect 1052271: This fix was to make sure that Social Security Numbers
 (SSN) are not being logged anywhere in the application logs to protect PII
 data.
 
 7. Defect 1025039: The blacklist conditions are provided with every new
 GFI mapping spreadsheet.  The logic is put into the nightly etls jobs.  9999 is
 still going to be used.  The requirement for blacklist is listed in the GFI
 spreadsheet.  Each night when the ETL jobs run, the blacklisted consults are
 assigned to stop code 9999, which will prevent DST from opening.
 
 8. Defect 1024321:  This is a technical defect.  Column service_NA for the
 clinical service has been removed with the new mappings received from the
 business. Changes were made to the backend and the DST database to remove this
 column that is no longer being used.
 
 9. Defect 1021687: The "No Appointment Available" Community Care
 eligibility flag for Veterans Community Care Program Eligibility consults will
 now update correctly on the DST dashboard when the No Later Than Date is
 changed.
 
 10. Defect 1064335: This is a technical defect.  This update is to set an
 AppDynamics key associate with End User Monitoring, where the output will be
 sent to a defined Production section (DST-PROD) within the production
 AppDynamics dashboard.
