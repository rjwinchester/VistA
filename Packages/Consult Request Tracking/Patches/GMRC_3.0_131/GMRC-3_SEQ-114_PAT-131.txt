Subject: CONSULT TOOLBOX 1.9.0044 DEFECT REMEDIATION

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
 This is an informational patch explaining changes in Consult Toolbox.
 NOTE: This patch is loaded on individual PC workstations via SCCM 
 software update push from local/regional OIT. 
 There is nothing that local sites can or need to do besides communicate 
 changes to the clinical users. No code changes were made to the Consult 
 application to accommodate these enhancements. 
 **************************************************************************
  
 Version 1.9.0044 modifies the Consult Toolbox application as described 
 below: 
  
 1.      Modified the text of the Launch DST dialog to "Mission Act 
         Requires the use of DST to complete the consult, when clinically 
         appropriate"
  
 2.      Remediated the defect related to the DST window moving behind all 
         open windows after selecting the Provisional diagnosis 
  
 3.      Remediated the defect related to Consult Toolbox not auto 
         displaying; previously, when the CPRS Window opens (e.g. Add
         Comment to Consult or Receive Consult), Toolbox automatically
         opens it's right click menu (auto display)
  
 4.      Remediated the defect related to patients with a CAN Score of 75; 
         this particular CAN Score was not placed into the correct range
         when displayed on the Admin Triage page, it now does
  
 5.      Remediated the defect related to incorrect comments from the 
         Receive Consult dialog; the error was when a radio button is
         selected, the text corresponding to that selection is NOT
         displayed; the fix placed the selected radio button text into the
         Consult Comment
  
 6.      Remediated the defect related to DST not being disabled when CTB 
         is Disabled; previously when Toolbox is disabled in the CPRS Tools
         submenu, only the ConsultToolbox was closed; now when the disable
         option is selected both ConsultToolbox and DSTLauncher are closed
         (the windows processes are ended)
  
 7.      Remediated the defect related to the CPRS Order a Consult Window 
         being hidden behind the Orders Menu when User Closes the Launch
         DST Pop Up Box
  
 8.      Remediated the defect related to the Link DST window (that 
         includes a button to add the information retrieved from DST to a
         consult note) does not display after the DST browser is closed
  
  
 This software was created by the Atlanta VA Medical Center in response to 
 a need to manage the process of consult management. During the life of a 
 consult, there are prescribed steps of actions to be taken, and there is 
 a need to be able track these steps at an individual patient level. 
 Additionally, there is a need to be able to understand the overall status 
 of consult management at a macro level, and identify specific services 
 needing attention or resources. Without opening and reading a patient 
 medical record, it is difficult to identify which patients have had which 
 scheduling steps completed.
  
 This software does several things. First, it makes it very easy for staff 
 to document actions completed quickly and consistently. Second, it uses 
 consistent verbiage to document these steps. Third, it eliminates the 
 need to take a second action or make a separate entry to track scheduling 
 steps. Fourth, this consistent verbiage allows software analysis of 
 records without needing to have software changes to VistA or CPRS.
  
 A separate process using corporate data warehouse queries and reports 
 allows creation of views showing such things as patients who have not had 
 first call, second call, scheduling letter sent or how much time has 
 passed between these events.
  
 Together, these allow tracking and managing consults without the need to 
 keep a separate list or other workflow to know which consults need 
 attention.
  
  
 Additional Information:
 ----------------------- 
 This software watches keyboard and mouse activity, and comes to life 
 when certain conditions occur.
  
 1. It only activates when the currently active windows title 
    "Receive Consult", "Add Comment to Consult" or "Discontinue Consult." 
    Otherwise nothing happens 
  
 2. When the user initiates a trigger event when either of 
    these windows have the focus, then depending on the open window a menu 
    appears for the user to select the appropriate action, then the
    software inserts the appropriate text into the comment box.
  
 3. The defined trigger is a right mouse click in the supported CPRS 
    consult actions.

 get it to work properly - this could cause data accuracy errors. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 In Receive Consult, the selections made will display correctly in the 
 Receive Consult Comments.
