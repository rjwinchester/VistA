Subject: DST Information patch for Version 1.0.03

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This is an information only patch for the Decision Support Tools application
 version 1.0.03 Build 13. There is no VistA component to this new build. This
 patch is for informational purposes only and is to list the defects that have
 been resolved in the application release.
  
 Google Analytics Integration Google Analytics is a web analytics that is 
 provided as software as service that tracks and reports website traffic. 
 The tool provides basic page metrics for tracking but can also be 
 expanded in complexity over time, with support Google Tag Manager to 
 follow specific fields and events on the site.  The tool is served in 
 dashboard format with a different endpoint for any approved user to view, 
 configure, and monitor page traffic for the DST site.  The tool will 
 monitor the following environments DEV, SQA, DEMO, PREPROD, and PROD for 
 complete insight to all of DST.  Google Analytics is configured per TRM 
 requirements, such as the removal of identifying data and the prevention 
 of cookies being shared by domains.  
  
 Planned Metrics:
  - Page Views
  - Page Timings
  - Custom Event metrics (e.g., Button Click)
  - Association with back-end services
  
 Google Analytics is not visible to the average end user of DST.
