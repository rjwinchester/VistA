Subject: VISTA INTAKE 1 NSR20130715 SF 513 MASK FIRST 5 DIGITS OF SSN

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch implements the New Service Request (NSR) 20130715 by masking the
 first 5 digits of the patient's Social Security Number (SSN) with X's on
 Standard Form (SF) 513. This code modification has been approved by Patient
 Safety and the SSN Reduction team because SF 513 has two other unique
 identifiers (name and DOB).
  
 This NSR is part of the VistA Intake Program (VIP), which delivers Class 3
 field-developed VistA modifications as Class 1 nationally-distributed VistA
 software.
