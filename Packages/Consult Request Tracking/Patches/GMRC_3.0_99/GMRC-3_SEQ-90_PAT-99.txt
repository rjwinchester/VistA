 HealthShare Referral Manager (HSRM) is an enterprise-wide system in 
 support of community care used by facility community care staff to 
 generate referrals and authorizations for Veterans receiving care in the 
 community. Clinical and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) community 
 care staff located at VA medical centers, outpatient clinics, 
 community-based outpatient clinics, and Veterans Integrated Service 
 Network offices use this solution to enhance Veteran access to care. HSRM 
 is an integral component of the community care information technology 
 (IT) architecture that allows Veterans to receive care from community 
 providers. 
  
 HSRM allows VA to transition from what is currently a largely manual 
 process to a more streamlined process that generates standardized 
 referrals and authorizations according to clinical and business rules. 
 HSRM supports clinical and administrative processes expected to:
  
 Seamlessly provide eligible Veterans with prompt referrals to a
 community provider of their choice Provide community providers with
 referrals and authorizations consistent with industry standards
  
 Decrease the administrative burden on VA clinical and facility
 community care staff members by establishing clinical and business
 pathways that reflect best practices, consistent outcomes, and reduced
 turnaround times, along with a solution that automates those pathways
  
 Facilitate communication between facility community care staff and 
 community providers via a unified platform that enables the secure 
 exchange of medical information
  
 VistA patch GMRC*3.0*99 delivers capability to transmit Community Care
 consult messages from Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) as an HL7 
 message to HSRM.
