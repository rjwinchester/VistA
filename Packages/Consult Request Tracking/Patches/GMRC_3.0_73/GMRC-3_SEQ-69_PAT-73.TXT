Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_PROD_OVERVIEW_GUIDE_GROUPS_5_6_7.pdf)posted on the Anonymous
 directory for installation order. This is critical for proper
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 This patch is part of the Computerized Patient Records System CPRSv30 
 project. This project will modify the Computerized Patient Record 
 System, Text Integration Utilities, Consults, Health Summary, Problem 
 List, Clinical Reminders, and Order Entry/Results Reporting to meet 
 the requirements proposed by the Dept. of Health and Human Services 
 to adopt ICD-10 code set standards Clinic Orders.
  
 On January 16, 2009, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 
 released a final rule for replacing the 30-year-old ICD-9-CM code set 
 with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) and International Classification of Diseases, 
 Tenth Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) with dates of 
 service, or date of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or after 
 the industry activation date. The classification system consists of more
 than 68,000 codes, compared to approximately 13,000 ICD-9-CM codes.  There
 are nearly 87,000 ICD-10-PCS codes, while ICD-9-CM has nearly 3,800
 procedure codes.  Both systems also expand the number of characters
 allotted from five and four respectively to seven alpha-numeric
 characters.  This value does not include the decimal point, which follows
 the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set.  There is no decimal point
 in the ICD-10-PCS code set.  These code sets have the potential to reveal
 more about quality of care, so that data can be used in a more meaningful
 way to better understand complications, better design clinically robust
 algorithms, and better track the outcomes of care.  ICD-10-CM also
 incorporates greater specificity and clinical detail to provide
 information for clinical decision making and outcomes research.
  
 NOTE: Functionality specific to activation of the ICD-10 code set shall 
 not be seen by end users until the code set has been activated.

     Two new fields were added to this file: 30.1;2 (PROVISIONAL DIAGNOSIS 
     DATE) and 30.1;3 (PROVISIONAL DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM).  These fields are 
     required to perform lookups on ICD data.

 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Hines          ftp.domain.ext   <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>

 Installation Overview
 ---------------------
 This patch installs the necessary routine updates to make the GMRC 
 package compliant with the mandate to use ICD-10 codes.  The installation 
 also contains one post-install routine that will populate the new 
 PROVISIONAL DIAGNOSIS DATE (30.2) and PROVISIONAL DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM (30.3)
 fields for existing entries in the REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file.  The
 PROVISIONAL DIAGNOSIS DATE will be populated using the value pulled from
 FILE ENTRY DATE (.01) field.  The PROVISIONAL DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM field will
 be populated with "ICD" to indicate these diagnoses are from the ICD-9-CM
 coding system.  These fields are only populated for existing entries where
 the provisional diagnosis contains an ICD code.  Consult records with a
 free text diagnosis will not have these fields populated.
  
 Pre-installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 There are no pre-install steps for this patch.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 ==========================
  
   NOTE: This patch should not be queued.  
  
    It is not necessary to disable any options. You should install
    this patch during a period of low usage to avoid potential disruption 
    to users.  The installation time will vary with the number of entries 
    in the REQUEST/CONSULTATION file (#123).  Installation times reported 
    during testing were between approximately 25 and 50 minutes.
     
 1.  Download the GMRC_30_73.KID file from the appropriate
     FTP Server to a directory on your system.
  
 2.  Use the LOAD A DISTRIBUTION option on the KIDS INSTALLATION menu, and
     enter: [DIR:]GMRC_30_73.KID, where [DIR:] is the local directory where
     you have stored the host file.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch:

         of a Transport Global that is currently loaded in the ^XTMP
         global.
     b.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     d.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option
     and choose the patch to install:
     GMRC*3.0*73 
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//'   Answer 'NO'
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//'  Answer 'NO'
