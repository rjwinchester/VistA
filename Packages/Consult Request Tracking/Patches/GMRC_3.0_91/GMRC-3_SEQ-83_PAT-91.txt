Subject: CONSULT ALERT ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch, along with patch OR*3.0*452, introduces changes so that
 users who are specifically identified to receive an alert by the person 
 making a comment on a consult will receive the alert regardless of 
 whether the alert is enabled or disabled for those users.
  
 Any users added via the "Send additional alerts" checkbox on the Add 
 Comment to Consult dialog will always receive the CONSULT/REQUEST UPDATED 
 alert.
  
 Note About Tracking Alert Activity and Recipients
 -------------------------------------------------
 Users added via "Send additional alerts" have never appeared in the
 alert tools for determining *how* a specific user could receive an alert.
 For example, the Determine Recipients for a Notification [ORB3 DETERMINE
 RECIPIENTS] option does not reflect a user added via "Send additional 
 alerts" other than if that user has the alert Enabled/ON.
  
 The override enhancement in this patch does not change the information 
 above. If a user believes that s/he has received a CONSULT/REQUEST
 UPDATED alert in error, and that user has the alert OFF/Disabled, then it 
 can be assumed that the user was added via the override mechanism. The 
 user who added the comment that triggered the alert, may be able to 
 confirm who was selected as additional recipients.
  
 Once the alert has been generated/sent, all tools/reports for tracking 
 alert recipients and recipient activity (i.e. First displayed to 
 recipient; Processed by recipient; etc.) will display recipients and 
 activity of users added via "Send additional alerts". This is the same 
 system behavior as before this enhancement was installed.

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch. It is imperative that you have performed a
 backup of the routines included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created. No
 data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no rollback
 strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
