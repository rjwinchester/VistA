Subject: VS GUI v2.0.0.8 Informational Patch

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

  
 Informational Patch for VS GUI
  
 The VistA Scheduling Enhancements (VSE) project provides critical, near-term
 enhancements to the existing scheduling system in the absence of a new,
 Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) enterprise solution.   The purpose of VSE is
 to provide immediate relief to the scheduling clerks by improving how
 information is presented.  The selected solution will deliver a Graphical
 User Interface (GUI) developed in C# which will be installed on the user's
 desktop (thick client) and interface with Legacy VistA.  Additionally, the VSE
 project will deliver a series of enhancements to legacy VistA Scheduling v5.3.
  
 Patches SD*5.3*627, SD*5.3*628, SD*5.3*642, SD*5.3*643, SD*5.3*645 and
 GMRC*3*83 were approved for National Release on 4/29/16 and released on
 5/3/2016 with the constraint that patches would not be installed in the
 Production environment until patches GMRC*3.0*86, SD*5.3*651 and SD*5.3*658
 were approved for National Release.  At this time, GMRC*3.0*86, SD*5.3*651 and
 SD*5.3*658 have been approved for National Release. 
  
 Patches SD*5.3*627, SD*5.3*628, SD*5.3*642, SD*5.3*643, SD*5.3*645, and
 GMRC*3*83 each have a statement in the patch description instructing sites
 not to install in production.  With the release of patches GMRC*3.0*83,
 SD*5.3*651, SD*5.3*658 and MBAA*1*4 sites can disregard that message and
 are now approved to install patches SD*5.3*627, SD*5.3*628, SD*5.3*642,
 SD*5.3*643, SD*5.3*645, and GMRC*3*83.
  
 Patches must be installed in the following order:
  
  GMRC*3.0*83 
  SD*5.3*627 
  SD*5.3*628 
  SD*5.3*643 
  SD*5.3*642 
  SD*5.3*645
  GMRC*3.0*86
  SD*5.3*651 
  SD*5.3*658
  MBAA*1*4
   
 Sites may experience extended install times for patches GMRC*3.0*83 and
 GMRC*3.0*86.  The duration depends on several factors including the Operating
 System (VMS/Linux), Hardware Configuration and the number of records stored
 in Outpatient Encounter File #409.68.  The team collected data from 24 sites
 and the median install time was 88 minutes.  Two sites reported install times
 over 50 hours however those sites have over 40 million records in File #409.68
 and run on VMS.  If your site has a high number of records
 in File #409.68, runs on VMS and/or has a hardware configuration that shares
 resources with other instances it is recommended that these patches be
 installed during off-peak hours or over a weekend.  During installation it is
 recommended that consults be disabled; however, it is not required.
  
 If your site plans to disable consults during the installation of the GMRC
 patch, the following checklist and procedures are intended to assist
 facilities in implementing their contingency plan.  Commonly, facility
 contingency plans are to "use paper".  
  
 Plan and prepare for the installation.
   1. Engage the Clinic Application Coordinator (CAC).
   2. Review your facility's contingency plan.
   3. Install at night or on a weekend to minimize clinical impact.
   4. For large sites, weekend installation is recommended in case of longer
      than expected installation times.
   5. It is important to have your site's CAC on call and/or accessible during
      the installation.  If your CAC doesn't have access to unlock patients'
      records that have been erroneously locked, you may need a local/regional
      Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) VistA programmer on call, as
      well.
  
 Communicate, communicate, and communicate.
   1. Ensure that entire staff is aware of the installation and what it will
      entail.
   2. Broadcast information about the installation, well in advance of the
      event.
   3. Send an informational email to all staff.
      a. It should outline what can and cannot be done in Computerized
         Patient Record System (CPRS) during installation of the patch.
      b. The email should also provide - phone numbers for application support.
   4. Send targeted communications to specific groups such as Clinic Staff.
   5. Plan to have face-to-face discussions with specific staff such as the
      Medical Officer of the Day, Emergency Department, and Intensive Care
      Unit staff.
   6. Announce the consult down-time using the overhead speaker system.
   7. Notify the Help Desk of the upcoming installation.
  
 What happens with clinical care?
   1. Disable the CPRS icon for 5-10 minutes in order to alert users that they
      need to finish what they are working on/doing. This will give your CAC
      time to temporarily disable consults and avoid having a user in the
      middle of creating a consult.
   2. If a STAT consult is needed, use the telephone.
   3. For routine consults, consider entering them after the install.  Perhaps
      the staff member who enters consults can "keep track" of the consults
      they write so they can be entered electronically after completion of the
      installation.
   4. Consider using paper consults during the installation.
  
 Documentation Updates:
 The VS GUI Install Guide has been updated to reflect the new patch order
 install as well as removing the comments not to install in Production.  As
 previously stated, the patch descriptions in FORUM for patches SD*5.3*627,
 SD*5.3*628, SD*5.3*642, SD*5.3*643, SD*5.3*645, and GMRC*3*83 will not be
 updated and will continue to state "DO NOT INSTALL IN PRODUCTION"  That
 statement should be disregarded as the patches are now approved for
 installation into the production accounts.
  
  
 Please note that the release includes several patches and the VS GUI 
 client.  Instructions for installation are included in the VS GUI Install
 Guide Version 2.0 and should be reviewed prior to attempting
 installation.  Failure to follow these instructions could result in data
 corruption.
