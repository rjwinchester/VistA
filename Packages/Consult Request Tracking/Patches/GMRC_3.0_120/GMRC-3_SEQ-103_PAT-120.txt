Subject: STANDARDIZED EPISODES OF CARE (SEOC) UI AND API UPDATES

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
 This is an informational patch explaining development of the Standardized 
 Episodes of Care (SEOC) application.
  
 NOTE: This patch is loaded to an internal VA hosting environment and will 
 be available for use within the VA network.
  
 There is nothing that local sites can or need to do. 
 **************************************************************************
  
 This software is a reference database for managing care bundles for use by
 Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) and other
 VA systems. Services are grouped together within the SEOC system into 
 bundles so that clinicians can add these bundles to patients consult 
 records in a standardized fashion, reducing the amount of time spent 
 manually entering consult instructions, and providing uniformity among 
 the patient records and across facilities for how patient care is 
 prescribed for similar complaints.
  
 These bundles group together one or more services that are preselected for
 different specialties to be added to the consult records. In addition, the
 clinician is provided with information regarding prescribing rules and
 preauthorization requirements, so they can make the most informed 
 decisions regarding patient care.
  
 Additionally, SEOC data will be accessible outside of the 
 VistA/Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) so that users of 
 downstream applications will be accessing the same data, and SEOC 
 descriptions, reducing the chances of discrepancies.
  
 Additional Information:
 -------------------- 
 The software is installed in the VA Austin Information Technology Center
 (AITC) environment, and is accessible via the VA intranet. An API is made
 available for downstream applications to access SEOC data in a JavaScript 
 Object Notation (JSON) format.
  
 **************************************************************************
 Version 1.7 provides updates to the user interface layer for the SEOC
 database consistent with business requirements. An updated API layer is 
 also included to support requirements of the UI.
  
 The CRUD User Interface (UI) for authorized SEOC Administrators will be 
 enhanced based on business priority. Updates planned for this build 
 include:
 - Add the ability to Edit a Billing code record. 
 - Add the ability to Delete a Billing code record. 
 - Add the ability to add more than 1 Clinical Service with different 
   Medicare codes to Payables services. 
 - Add SEOC display text added to the API. 
 - Remove Max Visits from the SEOC system 
 - Modify the third digit of the Version number to be incremented for all 
   revisions
 - Expand the size of description fields in SEOC and Service tables
 - Update the SEOC database schema as required to support these features
