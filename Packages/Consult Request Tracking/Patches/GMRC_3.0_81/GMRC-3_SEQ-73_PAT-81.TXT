Subject: RENAME EARLIEST DATE TO CLINICALLY INDICATED DATE

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 A request has been made to rename a field in the CONSULTS/REQUEST
 TRACKING package (GMRC) and in the Computerized Patient Record System
 (CPRS) Consult Order Dialog from 'Earliest Appropriate Date' (EAD) to
 'Clinically Indicated Date' (CID). This is being done to support new
 Veterans Access, Control, and Accountability Act (VACAA) guidelines for
 measuring wait times. 
  
 This patch is being released in conjunction with CPRS GUI v30.B 
 (OR*3*350) and GMTS*2.7*112 which also contain modifications related to 
 this change request. The following changes are being implemented in this 
 GMRC patch.  Please refer to the other patches mentioned for items 
 specific to those patches.
  
  a) The new and edit/resubmit order processes for both consult and
  procedure orders, the SF-513 display and print, and the Consults tab
  detail display are all updated to use the CID nomenclature.
  
  b) The REQUEST/CONSULTATION file (#123) data dictionary is being updated.
  The EARLIEST DATE field (#17) will be renamed to CLINICALLY INDICATED
  DATE.
  
 The EARLIEST DATE field, more commonly referred to as Earliest 
 Appropriate Date, was released with GMRC*3.0*66 as part of CPRS GUI v28 
 and was first used in a production environment (test site) beginning 
 August 4th, 2010.  Upon release of this GMRC patch, the EARLIEST DATE 
 field will be renamed to CLINICALLY INDICATED DATE and all consult
 orders will carry that field name.  For a given VistA system, the 
 time period for which the field was referred to as EARLIEST DATE begins 
 with the installation of GMRC*3.0*66 and ends with the installation of 
 GMRC*3.0*81.
  
  
 LOCAL OBJECTS BASED ON EARLIEST DATE
 ====================================
 If your site has created any local data objects based on the EARLIEST DATE
 field, those objects will continue to function normally.  However, it is 
 likely that the displayed name/header for such an object would need to be
 updated to reflect that the underlying field name has changed from
 EARLIEST DATE to CLINICALLY INDICATED DATE.
  
  
 Patch Components:
 =================
  
 This patch contains:
  
 The data dictionary change to rename the EARLIEST DATE field to CLINICALLY
 INDICATED DATE.  
  
 The 11 routines that have been updated to incorporate this change into the
 GMRC package.
  
 The input template GMRC SETUP REQUEST SERVICE is being re-exported to 
 resolve a Remedy ticket.  Reference that section below for additional 
 information.
  
 ********************************NOTE********************************
 Three of the included routines contain comment-only changes. The
 checksums for these routines will appear the same with GMRC*3.0*81 as
 in the previous patch for each routine.  The comments were updated to
 remove references to 'earliest appropriate date'.  This change was made
 primarily to assist any development or support staff when reading the
 GMRC code.
  
 Those routines are:
       GMRCHL7
       GMRCHL7A
       GMRCSTL8

 INC000001115226 - Editing consult service name CARE COORDINATION HOME 
                   TELEHEALTH SCREENING
  
 Problem: Sites are occasionally renaming the "CARE COORDINATION HOME 
 TELEHEALTH SCREENING" Consult service which breaks the ability for a
 site to enroll/activate/inactivate patients for home telehealth. 
  
 Solution: The INPUT TEMPLATE, GMRC SETUP REQUEST SERVICE has been 
 modified to prevent the CARE COORDINATION HOME TELEHEALTH SCREENING 
 consult service name from being edited. All other fields for that 
 service should remain available for edit.

 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 -------------------------------------------------- 
 Software being released as a host file and/or documentation describing 
 the new functionality introduced by this patch are available.
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) address as directed by the CPRS
 Implementation team. Installation instructions will be distributed when
 your site begins the implementation process.
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at:
 http://www4.domain.ext/vdl/
  
 The updated documentation will not be on the vdl until after the phased
 deployment has completed.

 Patch Installation:

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.30.b Installation Guide" for installation 
 and set-up information. This document is exported as OR_30_350_IG.doc and
 OR_30_350_IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_350.ZIP and will be emailed to 
 the installation point of contacts by the CPRS Implementation team.
  
 Installation of these host files must be coordinated among the personnel 
 affected because these host files will be installed in one installation 
 session.
