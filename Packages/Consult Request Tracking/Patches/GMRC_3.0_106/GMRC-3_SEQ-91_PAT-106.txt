Description:
============

 Associated patches:  (v)GMRC*3.0*99  <<= must be installed
  
 HealthShare Referral Manager (HSRM) is an enterprise-wide system in 
 support of community care used by facility community care staff to 
 generate referrals and authorizations for Veterans receiving care in the 
 community. Clinical and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) community 
 care staff located at VA medical centers, outpatient clinics, 
 community-based outpatient clinics, and Veterans Integrated Service 
 Network offices use this solution to enhance Veteran access to care. HSRM 
 is an integral component of the community care information technology 
 (IT) architecture that allows Veterans to receive care from community 
 providers. 
  
 HSRM allows VA to transition from what is currently a largely manual 
 process to a more streamlined process that generates standardized 
 referrals and authorizations according to clinical and business rules. 
 HSRM supports clinical and administrative processes expected to:
  
 Seamlessly provide eligible Veterans with prompt referrals to a
 community provider of their choice Provide community providers with
 referrals and authorizations consistent with industry standards
  
 Decrease the administrative burden on VA clinical and facility
 community care staff members by establishing clinical and business
 pathways that reflect best practices, consistent outcomes, and reduced
 turnaround times, along with a solution that automates those pathways
  
 Facilitate communication between facility community care staff and 
 community providers via a unified platform that enables the secure 
 exchange of medical information
  
 This patch contains changes to the code that generates the HL7 consult 
 messages introduced by patch GRMC*3.0*99. The CCRA project required the
 addition of the following information to the existing HL7 message to
 support additional functionality in the HealthShare Referral Manager
 (HSRM). These include:
 a. The addition to IN1 segments to support Other Insurance Information 
 (OHI)
 b. The addition of the Reimbursable flag to the interface to communicate 
 to HSRM that the VA may not be the primary insurance plan for the 
 requested service
 c. The addition of the division or site ID that is separate from the 
 station ID of the site hosting the VistA instance. This is necessary for 
 VistA instances supporting multiple division sites so that HSRM has the 
 division identifier.
