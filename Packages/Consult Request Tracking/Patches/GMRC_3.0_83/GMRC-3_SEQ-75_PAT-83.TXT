 This patch will support the VistA Scheduling Enhancements E1-E2 project with 
 data dictionary changes in the REQUEST/CONSULTATION file #123. A brand new 
 MUMPS cross reference ("AG") is created in the file for the exclusive use of a 
 report from patch SD*5.3*627. 
  
 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: GMRC*3.0*83 MUST BE INSTALLED BEFORE SD*5.3*627.
 Any VistA application that would normally make changes to file #123 must
 not do so until after this patch has completed installation. The time to
 complete installation depends on the number of entries recorded in the
 file.
