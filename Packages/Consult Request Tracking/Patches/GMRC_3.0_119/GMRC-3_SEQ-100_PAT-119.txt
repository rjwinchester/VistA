Subject: ADMIN KEY-FIX THE ADMINISTRATIVELY RELEASED BY POLICY GROUP REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. GMRC*3.0*119 is being released to correct a defect identified in
    Incident INC3759691. In the Consult Management menu option [GMRC MGR]
    under the Consult Tracking Reports [GMRC REPORTS] option, the following
    report is being fixed:
    GR  Administratively Released Consults by Group [GMRC RPT ADMIN REL 
    CONS GROUPR]
  
    If a consult service placed with a service name containing -DS or
    -ADMIN is forwarded to a different consult service that does not
    contain -DS or -ADMIN, it creates a hard error in VistA when pulling
    the report. This patch fixes the defect so that the report will display
    without getting a hard error.
  
 2. In the same circumstance as described above, when the consult was 
    forwarded, it no longer included that consult in the count. This patch 
    fixes that issue.
  
 3. Descriptions were added to three options for the following local 
    reports on the Consult Management menu [GMRC MGR]:
  
    GR     Administratively Released Consults by Group [GMRC RPT ADMIN 
           RELEASE CONSULT]
    ST     Completion Time Statistics [GMRC RPT ADMIN REL CONS GROUPR]
    US     Administratively Released Consults by User [GMRC RPT ADMIN REL 
           CONS USER]

 Post-Installation Instructions

 Back-Out Plan:
 -------------------------------
  
 This patch contains 1 routine, GMRCADG.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routine in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of 
 install). The message containing the backed-up routine can be loaded with 
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman 
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed-up 
 routines onto the VistA System. 
  
 Go to the Backup of Patch_GMRC_3_119 message in Mailman. 
 At the Enter message action prompt, enter "X" to "Xtract PackMan" 
 At the Select PackMan Function prompt enter the number 6 to Install/Check 
 Message. 
 At the end of this process the pre-patch routines are restored.
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
 ----------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the GMRC routine GMRCADG contained in this patch using the option First
 Line Routine  Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routine contained in
 the GMRC*3.0*119 patch has been rolled back, the first two lines of the
 Routine will no longer contain the designation of patch GMRC*3.0*119 in
 the patch list section on line 2.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
     
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines
 included in this patch prior to installation.
    
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
    
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
    
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch description.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;3.0;CONSULT/REQUEST TRACKING;**[Patch List]**;DEC 27, 1997;Build 9
