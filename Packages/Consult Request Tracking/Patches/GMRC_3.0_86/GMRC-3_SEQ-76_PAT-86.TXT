Subject: VS GUI CONSULT PROCESSING UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
  1. REQUEST/CONSULTATION entries that are linked to appointments in a cancelled
     or no-show state are occasionally not displaying in VS GUI as expected.
     In order to resemble VistA processing, this has been corrected by looking
     in the COMMENT field (#5) of the REQUEST PROCESSING ACTIVITY multiple
     field (#40) of the REQUEST/CONSULTATION file (#123) for the expected text
     of 'no-show' for No-shows and 'cancel' for cancelled appointments.
  2. REQUEST/CONSULTATION entries that have a FILE ENTRY DATE that is older than
     365 days were displaying in VS GUI.  This has also been corrected.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. I8720696FY16 - In the VSE GUI, consults that have been cancelled by clinic
                   or no-showed do not return to the request grid.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   REQUEST/CONSULTATION entries that are linked to appointments in a cancelled
   or no-show state are occasionally not displaying in VistA Scheduling GUI as
   expected.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   In order to resemble VistA processing, the 'AG' cross-reference has been
   corrected to look in the COMMENT field (#5) of the REQUEST PROCESSING
   ACTIVITY multiple field (#40) of the REQUEST/CONSULTATION file (#123) for the
   expected keyword of 'no-show' for No-shows and 'cancel' for cancelled
   appointments.
  
 2. I8754980FY16 - Consults greater than 365 days old should not show up in the
                   RM Grid of the GUI
   Problem:
   -------
   Entries from the REQUEST/CONSULTATION file (#123) are being displayed in
   VistA Scheduling GUI even if the FILE ENTRY DATE field (#.01) of the
   REQUEST/CONSULTATION file (#123) is older than 365 days.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The 'AG' cross-reference of the REQUEST/CONSULTATION file (#123) has been
   modified to NOT include Consult Requests that are greater than 365 days
   old.
