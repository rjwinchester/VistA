Subject: FIX CONTROL CHARACTERS IN CONSULT MESSAGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
    
   Associated patches:  (v)GMRC*3.0*106  <<= must be installed
  
    
   The Community Care Referrals and Authorizations (CCR&A) application is 
   an enterprise-wide system used by Community Care (CC) staff to 
   automatically generate referrals and authorizations for all Veterans 
   receiving care in the community. Clinical and VA CC staff located at VA 
   Medical Centers, Outpatient Clinics, Community Based Outpatient 
 Clinics, 
   and VISN offices use this application.  The CCR&A solution is an 
   integral component of the VA Community Care Information Technology
   (IT) architecture that allows Veterans to receive care from Community 
   Providers. 
   
   This patch builds upon the HL7 processes created in patches GMRC*3.0*99 
   and GMRC*3.0*106.  It includes a critical fix to the HL7 message
   processing, where control characters in the consult data were creating
   problems and putting the logical link in an infinite loop.  This fix
   strips out those control characters so that the consult can be sent
   without incident and the link integrity maintained.

   Backout and rollback Procedure:
   -------------------------------
   In order to back out this patch, sites must use the
   KIDS option to Backup a Transport Global after loading
   the patch. They can then restore the routines from the
   backup message. If this option is not used, then backing
   out is not possible.
  
   In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
   decision to back-out the patch.
     
   It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines
   included in this patch prior to installation.
    
   The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
    
   No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
   rollback strategy is required.
    
   To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
   matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch description.
