Description:
============

 This patch addresses two urgent issues in the Consult/Request Tracking 
 package.
 1. Order rejection upon signature
 2. Diagnosis codes missing from consult transmissions to the Healthcare 
    Claims Processing System (HCPS).
  
 Issue #1
 --------
 In GMRC*3.0*33, the Consult/Request Tracking package implemented Code Set
 Versioning (CSV).  Part of that change was to validate the diagnosis code 
 contained in any consult or procedure requests.  With the activation of 
 ICD-10, this diagnosis validation logic is the root cause of numerous 
 orders being rejected by Consults with the message: "Provisional DX code 
 rejected: code not valid for the Coding System unable to file request".
  
 This patch, GMRC*3.0*85, removes the CSV logic from the new order and 
 edit/resubmit processes in VistA.  When an order is signed and released 
 to the Consult/Request Tracking package, Consults will no longer validate 
 the ICD code being placed with that order.  Therefore, Consult/Request 
 Tracking will now accept an order that contains an ICD-9 diagnosis code 
 while ICD-10 is the active coding system.
  
 This patch does nothing to alter the ICD code validation that is done in 
 CPRS GUI.  That logic will still be in effect if a user selects a consult 
 quick order (QO) where an ICD-9 code has been saved for the Provisional 
 Diagnosis prompt.  **The consult order can still be saved and signed.  It 
 will not be rejected by Consults.**
  
 In this scenario, the user may see a popup dialog entitled "Inactive ICD 
 Code" that states:
    "The provisional diagnosis is not active as of today's date.
    Another code must be selected before the order can be saved."
 Upon clicking OK in the popup dialog, the user is taken to the consult 
 (or procedure) order dialog so that the provisional diagnosis value can 
 be changed (if a diagnosis is required) or omitted entirely.
  
 To avoid this quick order scenario, sites may use the Review Quick Orders 
 for Inactive ICD9 Codes [ORCM GMRC CSV CHECK] option found on the Order 
 Menu Management [ORCM MGMT] menu.  This option produces a list of all 
 consult quick orders that contain inactive diagnosis codes.  These quick 
 orders may be reviewed for continued use and subsequently edited to 
 update them with active diagnosis codes.
  
 The following are the known scenarios in which a consult can be ordered 
 with an ICD-9 diagnosis code despite ICD-10 being active.  These 
 scenarios apply to outpatient orders.
  
 1. When a user interacts with a patient chart and the date/time set 
 for current activities predates ICD-10 activation and the user then 
 proceeds to enter a consult for today where a provisional dx is 
 required/entered, the Lexicon search will return ICD-9 codes.
  
 2. If a user selects a consult quick order that is configured for 
 AUTO-ACCEPT QUICK ORDER=YES and that quick order has an ICD-9 code saved 
 for the provisional diagnosis prompt.
  
 Previously, in all scenarios above, upon signing the consult order, the 
 user would receive the rejection message.  With the installation of 
 GMRC*3.0*85, these orders will no longer be rejected and consults will 
 continue to be processed as usual.
  
  
 Issue #2
 After the transition to ICD-10, the HCPS began receiving consult requests 
 that did not contain a diagnosis code. This creates a delay in processing 
 these requests as the consult must be manually edited in the Referral and 
 Authorization System (RAS) to re-enter the diagnosis code.
  
 The root cause for this was found to be a bug in the consults code with
 how the diagnosis code was being extracted from an array of data before
 transmission to the HCPS. Previously, the code was trying to extract the
 diagnosis code from the provisional diagnosis text, and it was 
 discovered that the extracted code was often a SNOMED code instead of the 
 actual ICD code.
  
 E.g. If the diagnosis was:
 Amyotrophy due to type 1 diabetes mellitus (SNOMED CT 427571000) (250.61)
 The routine was extracting the diagnosis code as "SNOMED CT 427571000"
 And the diagnosis text was extracted as:
 "Amyotrophy due to type 1 diabetes mellitus"
  
 After the installation of GMRC*3.0*85, the actual ICD diagnosis
 code will now be extracted, such as "250.61" in the above example.  The 
 diagnosis text will remain unaffected.

 CPRS-related Tickets
 Remedy #1304169, 1305953: Code not valid for Coding System
  
  
 Problem:
 -------
 After the ICD-10 implementation, a consult order has been created that 
 uses an ICD-9 code in the provisional diagnosis.  Consults attempts to 
 validate that the submitted ICD code is active and subsequently rejects 
 the order because it cannot find an ICD-9 code in the active coding 
 system (ICD-10).
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 When an order is signed and released to the Consult/Request Tracking 
 package, Consults will no longer validate the ICD code being placed with 
 that order.  Therefore, orders placed in these scenarios will no longer 
 be rejected by Consults.

 Problem:
 -------
 After the ICD-10 implementation, a consult order has been created that 
 uses an ICD-9 code in the provisional diagnosis.  Consults attempts to 
 validate that the submitted ICD code is active and subsequently rejects 
 the order because it cannot find an ICD-9 code in the active coding 
 system (ICD-10).  Provider may submit several consult orders not 
 realizing that each rejected order is creating downstream issues for 
 VistA Imaging.  VistA Imaging is unable to handle the rejected order.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 When an order is signed and released to the Consult/Request Tracking 
 package, Consults will no longer validate the ICD code being placed with 
 that order.  This change removes the condition that caused downstream
 issues where other packages cannot handle the rejected order.

 HCPC/RAS-related Ticket
 R6063960FY16 - Consult diagnosis code no longer transmitting to Healthcare
 Claims Processing System(HCPS)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 After the implementation of ICD-10, consult orders transmitted to the 
 HCPS were arriving without a diagnosis code.  This created a need to 
 manually edit these requests to add the diagnosis code back in.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The GMRC routine that processes these transmissions was obtaining the 
 diagnosis code from an incorrect location in a data array. That code has 
 been updated to reference the correct location in the array.

 Software & Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ------------------------------------- 
 There is no updated documentation provided with this patch.
 This patch is a PackMan build.  Therefore the software may be obtained by 
 forwarding the released patch message to the target system.
  
  
 Patch Installation:
 -------------------
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 This patch contains a simple pre-install routine that will prompt the 
 installer for names of recipients for a post-install generated MailMan 
 message.
 The post-install routine will create a tasked job to search the ORDER 
 file (#100) for a particular subset of orders and then send a MailMan
 report containing the findings to the recipients specified during the 
 pre-install.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 The post-install will create a tasked job to search the ORDER file 
 (#100) and generate a MailMan message containing the search results.  
 IT installers MUST contact and coordinate with site staff to learn the
 names of recipients BEFORE installing the patch. Do NOT install the patch 
 until you have names to specify as recipients.
  
 These recipients should be site staff who will be tasked with reviewing 
 Consult orders that were rejected upon signature with the message: 
 "Provisional DX code rejected: code not valid for the Coding System unable
 to file request".  These recipients may be local Clinical Applications
 Coordinators (CACs) or other staff identified by the site.  The installer 
 must work with the site to identify recipients before installing the 
 patch.  When discussing this issue with sites, referencing the rejection
 message above and the associated trouble tickets should help provide 
 context for the issue and assist with identifying recipients.
  
 Installers are also strongly encouraged to add themselves as recipients 
 for the post-install report as well.  Doing so will allow the installer 
 to notice when the tasked job has completed and the MailMan message has 
 been sent.
  
 No options need to be disabled for the pre-install
  
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install. The tasked job started by the post-install will likely
 take more time to complete.  It could be up to 30 minutes or more before
 the job completes and the recipients receive the specified MailMan
 message.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 The installation will update the routines associated with the diagnosis 
 code validation checks.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the
     patch GMRC*3.0*85:
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this
         patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//' A menu rebuild is not necessary.
     
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//' Inhibiting logons is not necessary.
     
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//' Disabling any options or protocols is not 
     necessary
     
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 No special post-installation steps are necessary.  If installers add
 themselves as recipients for the post-install message, they should verify 
 that the message was generated and received.
  
 As no options were disabled during the pre-install, there is no need to
 re-enable any options.
  
 If the tasked job exits before completion, the installer will receive a 
 MailMan message stating such along with directions on how to restart the
 task.  The task may be restarted by running RESTART^GMRCP85 from the 
 programmer prompt.
  
 Post-Install Tasked Job Details:
 --------------------------------
 The recipients gathered during the pre-install are stored in the 
 following ^XTMP array: ^XTMP("GMRCP85RECIPS")
  
 Any orders found during the tasked job search are stored in the following 
 ^XTMP array: ^XTMP("GMRCP85_ORDERS")
  
 If the tasked job exits before completion, the following ^XTMP array 
 contains the reference point used when the task is requeued: 
 ^XTMP("GMRCP85")
  
 The tasked job searches the ORDER file (#100).  The start date for the 
 search is 9/01/2015 and moves forward chronologically from that date. The 
 orders of interest are limited to Consults and Procedure orders where the 
 NATURE OF DC (100,61) is REJECTED and the DC REASON TEXT (100,66) 
 contains the phrase "Code not valid for Coding System".
 The output of the report is the patient's name + last four; the 
 intended consult service; the date the order was placed; and the order 
 number (IEN from file 100).  The last line of the report will be the 
 total number of orders found.
  
  
 Two abbreviated examples of the post-install generated message follow.  
 The first where orders of interest were found, and the second where no
 orders were found.
