 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. Left over "AC" x-ref for Consult Sub-services
  
    Problem:
    --------
    ServiceNow ticket INC0069411 reported that the Duplicate Sub-Service 
    Report showed a phantom sub-service relationship caused by orphan "AC" 
    and "APC" index entries in the REQUEST SERVICES [#123.5] file. The
    exact cause of the orphan entries was not found but it was determined
    that deleting entries being used as sub-services caused data integrity
    issues and inadvertent duplicate sub-service entries. According to the
    ticket, it is a known issue that duplicate sub-services cause crashes
    when using the Custom Consult view in the CPRS Consults Tab.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The data dictionary entry for the REQUEST SERVICES [#123.5] file was 
    modified to stop the deletion of entries that are a sub-service of
    another entry and show the following message. The modified routine
    is ^GMRCDDX.
  
     This entry cannot be deleted until it is removed as a sub-service of:
          <SERVICE NAME> 
     This is a required response. Enter '^' to exit

 Backout/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch. Because this patch contains data 
 dictionary changes, back-out must be done with the participation of the
 sustainment team.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the SERVICE NAME field's delete test and 
 can be provided upon request. Please call the national help desk or enter
 a help desk ticket, if required.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no data
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the SERVICE NAME 
 field's delete test no longer matched the patch version.
