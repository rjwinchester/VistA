Description:
============

                        XOBW*1*4
  
 ** 
    This patch is a very different patch to install, as it involves
    multiple people with different privileges and must be installed on
    multiple nodes/servers. The patch must also be installed even if
    your site is all-Linux.
 **
  
 VistA packages using HWSC are now being mandated to secure their 
 connections.
  
 VistA packages currently using HWSC as their web service client to remote 
 web services are not securing their connections with TLS/SSL.  This is 
 due to a potential risk of using TLS/SSL on VistA sites running on 
 OpenVMS.  When the HWSC package was released about 7 years ago, the use 
 of TLS/SSL was disabled for VistA sites running on OpenVMS due to a 
 memory leak that accumulates when sending requests. 
  
 Hewlett Packard was to release a fix to the problem but we haven't 
 confirmed if, or when, the fix was issued. The VistA Infrastructure (VI) 
 ran a new performance test to verify if the issue was still there.  The 
 memory leak did not appear, and it may be due to a fix released by Hewlett
 Packard when updating OpenVMS since 7 years ago, or were due to the 
 updates to Cache made by InterSystems.
  
  
 Since the recent tests indicate that there is no potential of 
 a memory leak, the HWSC package will now enable the use of TLS/SSL on 
 OpenVMS.
  
 This patch will create the "encrypt_only" Transport Layer Security 
 (TLS/SSL) configuration if it does not exist in the system, and also
 update the class xobw.WebServiceProxyFactory.
  
 This patch will update and create the following:
  1. routines
  2. update the class xobw.WebServiceProxyFactory
  3. update the class xobw.WebServer 
  4. create the "encrypt_only" Transport Layer Security 
     (TLS/SSL) configuration if it does not exist in the system
  
 Note: The TLS/SSL configuration must be installed in all nodes, both 
 front-end server nodes and database server nodes. See Post-Installation
 section.

 NSD Incident I9175972FY16, Enable SSL for VMS system 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 VistA packages currently using HWSC as their web service client to remote 
 web services are not securing their connections with TLS/SSL.  This is 
 due to a potential risk of using TLS/SSL on VistA sites running on 
 OpenVMS.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Since the recent tests indicate that there is no potential of a memory 
 leak, the HWSC package will now enable the use of TLS/SSL on OpenVMS by 
 making the following changes:
  
 1) Disable the flag that prevents the configuration and execution of 
     TLS/SSL enabled HWSC web service clients, specifically for OpenVMS; 
     and 
  2) Disable verification of remote server's host name.  New versions of 
     InterSystems Cache enable by default the property     
     SSLCheckServerIdentity, which did not exist when HWSC was released
     with Cache 5.2.3.  This is something that is enabled in web browsers 
     where a user is interacting with a browser, but HWSC is a web client
     with no user interaction.  Also RFC 2818, allows for disabling this 
     verification when "the client has external information as to the 
     expected identity of the server" which HWSC applications have when 
     they configure their applications.
