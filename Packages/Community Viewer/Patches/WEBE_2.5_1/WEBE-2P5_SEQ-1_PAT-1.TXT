 User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
 =========================
 User Acceptance Testers: Ann Arbor and Hines - Shannon Asperger (Ann 
 Arbor), Wendy Pardike (Ann Arbor), Bonnie Schweitzer (Ann Arbor), and 
 Luzvimina Clamana (Hines) have signed off following completion of UAT.
  
 The requirements planned for the CV 2.5 Sprints 1-6 were verified and 
 validated during the Development Independent Testing (DIT) phase of 
 testing. All requirements mapped to the test scripts. The scripts are 
 designed to be end-to-end functional tests of the system to evaluate 
 all the technical requirements including the testing of external 
 interfaces where appropriate.
  
 The DIT cycle consisted of smoke testing and the formal DIT. Before 
 starting the DIT cycle, a JLV Web application baseline is installed 
 on the system. Tests are then run against this software baseline. Any 
 issues found and potential resolutions are assessed for possible 
 inclusion in the software baseline.
  
 During DIT, the test team validated the requirements provided in the 
 RM requirements collection using the test scripts and the test cases.
 Any issue encountered is recorded as a defect in Rational CCM.
