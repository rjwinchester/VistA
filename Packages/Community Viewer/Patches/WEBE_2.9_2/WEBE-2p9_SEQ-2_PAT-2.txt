  - CCPM will access Provider Profile Management System (PPMS) data and 
    web service to retrieve Community Care Provider (CCP) data

    (Community Care PPMS Provider Management widget) and Risk Management 
    Providers (Risk Management Provider Management widget)
  - CCPM users will no longer be able to modify CCP provider data in CCPM; 
    Risk Management Provider (RMP) managers will still be able to modify 
    RMP provider data within CCPM
  - CCPM will only use National Provider Identifiers to allow users to 
    search for Community Care Providers

    Care Provider Groups" link
  - The "Community Care Provider Management" widget will be renamed to 
    "Risk Management Provider Management."

    Provider Management and Risk Management Provider Management widgets to 
    support users

  - Community Care Providers will use their NPI as their user name rather 
    than their e-mail address; Risk Management Providers will continue to 
    use their e-mail address as their user name
  
 User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
 =========================
 User Acceptance Tests: Anchorage, Hines, and Phoenix -
 Julie Reloza-Keating (Anchorage), Luz Clamana (Hines), and Carlotta Nez
 (Phoenix) have signed off following completion of UAT.
  
 JR Ruble, CV Business PM, on behalf of the user acceptance testers, has 
 concurred that the UAT was successful and that CV 2.9.1 is ready for 
 production deployment.
  
 The requirements planned for the CV 2.9.1 Sprints 1-3 were verified and 
 validated during the Development Independent Testing (DIT) phase of 
 testing. All requirements mapped to the test scripts. The scripts are 
 designed to be end-to-end functional tests of the system to evaluate 
 all the technical requirements including the testing of external 
 interfaces where appropriate.
  
 The DIT cycle consisted of smoke testing and the formal DIT. Before 
 starting the DIT cycle, a Community Viewer Web application baseline is 
 installed on the system. Tests are then run against this software 
 baseline. Any issues found and potential resolutions are assessed for 
 possible inclusion in the software baseline.
  
 During DIT, the test team validated the requirements provided in the 
 RM requirements collection using the test scripts and the test cases.
  
 Any issue encountered is recorded as a defect in Rational CCM.
