 CV version 2.9 includes the following changes:

   - View Page: Create / Edit Community Care Provider Groups
   - View Page: Search Patient Assignments
   - View Widget: Community Care Provider Management
   - Create New Provider
   - Create New Provider Group
   - Delete Provider

   - View List of Assigned Patient(s)
   - View List of Previously Assigned Patient(s)

   - View Provider(s) in Provider Group
 - Creation of a CCPM jMeadows (CCPMMeadows) component which is separate
   from CV jMeadows which is compartmentalized specifically for CCPM so
   that:
   - Updates to CV will not impact CCPM
   - Integration of future CCPM-only items will not affect or be affected 
     by CV GUI changes
   - Improve efficiency of alignments of CV to JLV.
 - Creation of two separate and distinct GUI components, one for CV and
   one for CCPM, to improve efficiency of alignments of CV to JLV.
  
 User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
 =========================
 User Acceptance Tests: Anchorage, Hines, and Phoenix -
 Julie Reloza-Keating (Anchorage), Luz Clamana (Hines), and Carlotta Nez
 (Phoenix) have signed off following completion of UAT.
  
 JR Ruble, CV Business PM, on behalf of the user acceptance testers, has 
 concurred that the UAT was successful and that CV 2.9 is ready for 
 production deployment.
  
 The requirements planned for the CV 2.9 Sprints 1-3 were verified and 
 validated during the Development Independent Testing (DIT) phase of 
 testing. All requirements mapped to the test scripts. The scripts are 
 designed to be end-to-end functional tests of the system to evaluate 
 all the technical requirements including the testing of external 
 interfaces where appropriate.
  
 The DIT cycle consisted of smoke testing and the formal DIT. Before 
 starting the DIT cycle, a Community Viewer Web application baseline is 
 installed on the system. Tests are then run against this software 
 baseline. Any issues found and potential resolutions are assessed for 
 possible inclusion in the software baseline.
  
 During DIT, the test team validated the requirements provided in the 
 RM requirements collection using the test scripts and the test cases.
  
 Any issue encountered is recorded as a defect in Rational CCM.
