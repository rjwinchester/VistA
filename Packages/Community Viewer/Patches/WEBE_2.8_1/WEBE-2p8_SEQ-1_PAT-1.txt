 User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
 =========================
 User Acceptance Tests: Anchorage, Hines, and Phoenix -
 Julie Reloza-Keating (Anchorage), Luzviminda Clamana (Hines), 
 and Carlotta Nez (Phoenix) have signed off following completion of UAT.
  
 JR Ruble, CV Business PM, on behalf of the user acceptance 
 testers, has concurred that the UAT was successful and that CV 2.8 is 
 ready for production deployment.
  
 The requirements planned for the CV 2.8 Sprints 1-4 were verified and 
 validated during the Development Independent Testing (DIT) phase of 
 testing. All requirements mapped to the test scripts. The scripts are 
 designed to be end-to-end functional tests of the system to evaluate 
 all the technical requirements including the testing of external 
 interfaces where appropriate.
  
 The DIT cycle consisted of smoke testing and the formal DIT. Before 
 starting the DIT cycle, a Community Viewer Web application baseline is 
 installed on the system. Tests are then run against this software 
 baseline. Any issues found and potential resolutions are assessed for 
 possible inclusion in the software baseline.
  
 During DIT, the test team validated the requirements provided in the 
 RM requirements collection using the test scripts and the test cases.
   
 Any issue encountered is recorded as a defect in Rational CCM.
