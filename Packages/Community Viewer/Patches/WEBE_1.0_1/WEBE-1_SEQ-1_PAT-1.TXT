 Participating Test Sites:
 =========================
 Participating Test Sites:  Albany and Hines - Anthony Mazzone (Albany) 
 and Carolina Mosley (Hines) have signed off following completion of 
 UAT.
 The requirements planned for the CV 2.0 (listed in Section 1.3, Testing
 Scope) Sprints 1-8 were verified and validated during the Development 
 Independent Testing (DIT) phase of testing. All requirements mapped to 
 the test scripts. The scripts are designed to be end-to-end functional 
 tests of the system to evaluate all the technical requirements including 
 the testing of external interfaces where appropriate.
  
 The DIT cycle consisted of smoke testing and the formal DIT. Before 
 starting the DIT cycle, a JLV Web application baseline is installed on 
 the system. Tests are than run against this software baseline. Any issues
 found and potential resolutions are assessed for possible inclusion in 
 the software baseline.
  
 During DIT, the test team validated the requirements provided in the 
 RTM using the test scripts and the test cases. Any issues encountered 
 is recorded as a defect in JIRA (internal defect tracking repository 
 used).
