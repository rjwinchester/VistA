Subject: VETERANS HEALTH IDENTIFICATION CARD (VHIC) APPLICATION, VERSION 4.7

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Patch WEBC*1*3  announces the release of the Veterans Health 
 Identification Card (VHIC) web application version 4.7, which provides 
 several upgrades and enhancements within the national release of VHIC.
  
 Enhancements:
 =============
 - Improvements to report functionality
      o  A new report with dynamic reason selection has been created to
         show the number of VHICs on hold. It will enable facilities to
         drill down and identify issues/progress/reasons. It will be
         available to supervisor and associates, limited to their facility.
  
      o  A national summary total is now included on all national level
         reports.
  
  
 - Improvements to user screens 
      o  When copying the Integration Control Number (ICN) from the Master 
         Veteran Index (MVI) Toolkit Identity Proofing (IP) application
         into the VHIC application to search for the Veteran, an unreadable
         space is copied over.  The VHIC application now trims the ICN
         field on Step 1 of the Card Request Process so that the VHIC user
         does not have to physically perform a backspace or delete spaces.
  
  
 - Ability to monitor service calls
      o  The VHIC system now logs the metrics of each service call received
         by the Card Picture Service and Card Detail Service.
  
 Implementation:
 ===============
 The VHIC 4.7 is a centrally managed web-based application and will be 
 implemented as a one-time rollout by the VHIC Technical team (ByLight). 
 No software will be installed at the facilities.
