Subject: VETERANS HEALTH IDENTIFICATION CARD (VHIC) APPLICATION, VERSION 4.6

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Patch WEBC*1*2  announces the release of the Veterans Health 
 Identification Card (VHIC) web application version 4.6, which provides 
 several upgrades and enhancements within the national release of VHIC.
  
 Enhancements:
 =============
 - Updates the business logic to limit Veterans to a single active VHIC.
      o Provides better support for consuming applications that swipe / 
        scan VHICs.  Many applications only support a single identifier per
        Veteran and are unable to retrieve Veteran data if the card scanned
        is not the card the system has used as the identifier.
  
 - Decouples VHIC from the Access Services (AcS) Identity Proofing (IP) 
   solution
      o AcS IP is being sunset in March 2016.
      o Any required Veteran proofing activities will occur in the Master 
        Veteran Index (MVI) Toolkit application prior to starting the card 
        request process in the VHIC application.
  
 - Modified screens to provide better user experience
      o Streamlined the card issuance process now that identity proofing 
        activities must occur prior to card request.
      o Created a new VHIC Print Service Batch Error Summary Report Query 
        Screen
      o Made minor adjustments to a number of other reports as requested by
        the VHIC Business.
  
  
 Implementation:
 ===============
