Subject: ADD HEIGHT AND WEIGHT TO RADIOLOGY EXAM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 RA*5.0*132 modifies the VistA Radiology package to display a patient's 
 height and weight when scheduling exams. It is important for a provider to
 know a patient's height and weight prior to a Radiology procedure; 
 however, that data is not currently available in the VistA Radiology 
 package when scheduling exams. This patch adds the height and weight from 
 the GMRV VITAL MEASUREMENT (#120.5) file to the patient demographics that 
 display when using the Print Selected Requests by Patient [RA 
 ORDERPRINTPAT], Register Patient for Exams [RA REG], and Add Exams to Last
 Visit [RA ADDEXAM] options in VistA. This patch also adds the height to
 the existing weight displayed when using the Print Rad/Nuc Med Requests by
 Date [RA ORDERPRINTS] option.

 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option. The message containing the
 backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the
 Message Action prompt. The PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE is then
 used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA system.
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the RA routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the RA routines have been backed
 out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain the
 designation of patch RA*5.0*132 on line 2 in the patch list section.
