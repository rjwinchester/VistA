 Problem A:
 ----------
  
 Radiology historical demographic updates:
  
 If a name change occurs on VistA , it is not communicated to the 
 departmental imaging system or Picture Archiving and Communication System 
 (PACS),  then order processing is delayed at the departmental imaging 
 system because of the name mismatch.  Subsequently, when the images with 
 the old name sent are back to VistA, processing is delayed because of the 
 name mismatch.  Radiology PACS sites currently have a backlog of rejected 
 radiology orders due to unmatched patient identifiers (patient name, date 
 of birth, gender and social security number).
  
  
 Resolution A:
 -------------
  
 Vista Imaging (VI) patch MAG*3.0*183 will add ADT patient demographic 
 updates (A08) and patient identifier updates (A47) functionality for VI 
 and PACS, allowing real time demographic updates.  To address patient 
 demographic updates that took place prior to the installation of 
 MAG*3*183, this patch will provide a menu option to send HL7 ADT messages.
 A new option called 'Send ADT HL7 message to PACS' [RA ADT] will be 
 created and reside on the 'Radiology HL7 Menu' [RA HL7 MENU]. This option 
 will allow the application end user to select one or more radiology 
 patients, and then it will call the VI Application Program Interface 
 (API) to generate an ADT A08 and, if needed, an ADT A47 message to PACS. 
 The user must hold the RA MGR key to access this new option.
  
 Problem B:
 ----------
  
 Mass Override Exam Status retired:
  
 When the 'Mass Override Exam Status'[RA EXAMSTATUS MASS OVERRIDE] option 
 is used, it does not result in any stop code or CPT crediting.  With the 
 release of RA*5.0*133, the default value for the fields TRACK REQUEST 
 STATUS CHANGES (#.119) and TRACK EXAM STATUS CHANGES (.11) of our RAD/NUC 
 MED DIVISION (#79) file will be set to 'YES' without out the ability to 
 change from that value of 'YES'. It was discussed and put to a vote and 
 the Radiology Informatics Committee (RIC) voted that the 'Mass Override 
 Exam Status' [RA EXAMSTATUS MASS OVERRIDE] option be retired.
  
 Resolution B:
 -------------
  
 The menu option 'Mass Override Exam Status'[RA EXAMSTATUS MASS OVERRIDE] 
 will be removed from sites 'Supervisor Menu' [RA SUPERVISOR] and the 
 related code in routine RAESO will also be removed.  Note that the 
 'Override a Single Exam's Status to 'complete'' [RA OVERRIDE] will still 
 be functional.
  
 Problem C:
 ----------
 CA ticket #I9879245FY16 
 Since the pregnancy screen prompt was introduced with patch RA*5.0*99,
 there has been a discrepancy between the exam edit menu options('Case No. 
 Exam Edit'[RA EDITCN] and 'Edit Exam by Patient'[RA EDITPT]) and the 
 'Status Tracking of Exams' [RA STATRACK] menu option. All of these 
 options are used to input the required parameters for the modality 
 allowing exams to advance through each status until complete.  The 
 requirement for female patients within the age bracket is that the 
 pregnancy screen prompt be answered for the exam to reach a completed 
 status. The pregnancy screen prompt was not added to the 'Status Tracking 
 of Exams'[RA STATRACK] option, which if used will allow an exam to reach 
 a completed status without the pregnancy screen being answered, thus not 
 meeting the requirement to capture the patient's response in the 
 patient's medical record.
  
 Resolution C:
 -------------
  
 Add the pregnancy screen prompt to the 'Status Tracking of Exams option'.
 The input template [RA STATUS CHANGE] and routine RAUTL8 are modified to 
 display the pregnancy screen prompt and comment for patients meeting 
 gender and age requirements.  In order to provide the same functionality 
 as the exam edit options, the routine RASTREQ is modified to prevent a 
 study from reaching a completed status if the pregnancy screen prompt is 
 not answered. Both 'Status Tracking of Exams'[RA STATRACK] and the exam 
 edit options [RA EDITCN, RA EDITPT] will now present the pregnancy screen 
 to the user regardless of the report status.
  
 Problem D:
 ----------
  
 It was reported that the pregnancy screen prompt is required to be 
 answered for outside studies (entered through the radiology package) to 
 reach a completed status.  Since the patient is not examined at the 
 facility, the person entering the outside report does not know the answer 
 to the question:       
 Enter the patient's response to the question of if she is pregnant at the 
 time of the exam.
      Choose from:
         y        Patient answered yes
         n        Patient answered no
         u        Patient is unable to answer or is unsure
 This causes delays in patient care, as the outside report has to be 
 deleted, then the study cased for this question to be answered, and then 
 the outside report entered again. 
  
 Resolution D:
 -------------
  
 Remove the requirement for the pregnancy prompt to be answered for an 
 outside report, allowing the study to go to a completed status.  Routine 
 RASTREQ is modified to insert a 'u' (Patient is unable to answer or is 
 unsure) in the PREGNANCY SCREEN [#32] field and "OUTSIDE STUDY" in the 
 PREGNANCY SCREEN COMMENT [#80] field. This is the same functionality 
 currently in place with outside reports created by the VistA Imaging 
 Importer. Note that if these fields already contain data, the existing 
 data values will not be changed.
  
 Problem E:
 ----------
  
 The Print Registered Exams to Alternate Printer functionality comes from 
 waiver request 376790 and is supported by the Radiology Informatics 
 Committee and the VHA Radiology Program Office.  When using the national 
 Radiology software to 'Register Patient for Exams', unregistered and 
 registered requests are printed to the general x-ray printer (Request 
 Printer).  This causes problems when the printer is not in close 
 proximity to the radiology technician because they must walk long 
 distances to obtain their printout, causing them to fall behind in 
 processing patients.
  
 Resolution E:
 -------------
  
 Add a new Registered Request Printer parameter [field #28)] to the 
 Imaging Locations [#79.1] file. Modify routines RAREG1 and RAREG3 to 
 check the new printer parameter and if it is defined, the request will 
 print to that device when the exam registration is complete.  If the 
 Registered Request Printer is not defined for that location, the request 
 will not print. The 'Device Specifications for Imaging Locations'[RA 
 DEVICE] menu will be modified to allow printer assignment for the new 
 Registered Request Printer. The help text for this menu was also modified 
 to reflect the new printer. The 'Location Parameter List'[RA SYSLOCLIST] 
 will be modified to display the new Register Request Printer.
  
  
 Problem F:
 ----------
  
 Images captured indicator
  
 The Indicator of images associated with Exams on Radiology Reports comes 
 from waiver request 382559 and is supported by the Radiology Informatics 
 Committee and the VHA Radiology Program Office.  When using the 
 'Delinquent Status Report'[RA DELINQUENT], or 'Incomplete Exam Report'[RA 
 INCOMPLETE] options within the nationally released Radiology package, it 
 is not possible to determine if the exam has an image associated with 
 it.  Therefore, it is difficult for technologists to ensure that their 
 exams have transferred successfully to VistA Imaging.
  
 Resolution F:
 -------------
  
 The VA Heartland Western Orbit facilities have modified the outputs to 
 display a letter 'i' after the case number whenever the IMAGE field 
 (#2005) is populated in the RAD/NUC MED REPORTS file (#74).  This offers 
 staff a quick reference point to assess image transfer to VistA Imaging.
  
 Append the images acquired indicator (i) to the case number in routine 
 RADLQ1, used for the 'Delinquent Status Report' [RA DELINQUENT] and 
 'Incomplete Exam Report' [RA INCOMPLETE].
  
 Problem G:
 ----------
  
 I16983173FY18 - Status Tracking of printset exams with SSANs turned on. 
  
 Birmingham reported that after turning on Site Specific 
 Accession Numbers, printsets do not display correctly in the Exam Status 
 Tracking menu.  This is due to a defect in routine RASTEXT where the 
 internal case number is not set correctly when doing the SSAN lookup. 
  
 Resolution G:
 -------------
  
 Modify routine RASTEXT to set RACNIXX (internal case number) correctly 
 for lookup with SSANs.

 Backout/Roll-back Strategy:
 ===========================
  
  Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
  development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
  to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between 
  development team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA
  personnel. A national help desk ticket should be logged before attempting
  any backout procedures.  
  
  Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
  saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
  Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of 
  install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded
  with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The
  Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the
  backed up routines onto the VistA System.
