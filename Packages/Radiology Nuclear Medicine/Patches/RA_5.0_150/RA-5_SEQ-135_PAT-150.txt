Subject: RA PROC OPTION SEMI-COLON ISSUE AND OUTSIDE RPT ENT OBSERVATION DT/TM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following 2 issues:
      
 Issue 1
 When attempting to enter a new Procedure using 
 the menu option RA PROCEDURE, the system will error 
 out with a <SYNTAX>BR1^DIE0 error if the procedure 
 being entered contains a semi-colon.
      
 Issue 2
 When using Menu Option-Outside Report Entry/Edit an
 observation date/time is not recorded in the HL7 (Health Level 7) 
 OBR(Observation Record) Data Element 22 (OBR-22).  
 This causes some PACS (Picture Archiving and Communications System) 
 machines to not display the reports in the correct date/time order. 
 This Issue is specific to Outside Report Entry only.

 Associated NSR(s):
 =============
 N/A
       
 Problem 1:
 --------
      
 A <SYNTAX>BR1^DIE0 error is generated when a user
 attempts to enter a Radiology Procedure using menu
 option RA PROCEDURE.
      
 Resolution 1:
 ------------     
     
 A modification will be made to routine RANPRO to not
 allow an entry containing a semi-colon.  The option will
 display an error message and return the user to the 
 RAD/NUC MED PROCEDURE NAME: prompt.
      
 Problem 2
 --------
      
 When a Radiology Report is entered using menu
 option-Outside Report Entry/Edit, the observation
 date/time is not captured for the report.  This is
 a problem for some PACS machines at the site 
 causing reports to not display in the correct order.
      
 Resolution 2:
 ------------    
       
 A modification will be made in routine RAHLRPT1
 to capture the observation date/time in the HL7 
 (Health Level 7) OBR-22 for transmission to the 
 PACS machine.

     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ====================
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
        
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
      
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
      
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
      
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions
