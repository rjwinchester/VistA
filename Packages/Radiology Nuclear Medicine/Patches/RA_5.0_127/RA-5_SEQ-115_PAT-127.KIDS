"KRN",19,1010,1,12,0)
 
"KRN",19,1010,1,13,0)
There are four types of procedures.  They are the following:
"KRN",19,1010,1,14,0)
 
"KRN",19,1010,1,15,0)
      1) Detailed - Procedure is associated with one or more AMIS codes
"KRN",19,1010,1,16,0)
                    and must have a CPT (Current Procedural Terminology)
"KRN",19,1010,1,17,0)
                    code assigned to it.
"KRN",19,1010,1,18,0)
 
"KRN",19,1010,1,19,0)
      2) Series   - Procedure is associated with more than one AMIS
"KRN",19,1010,1,20,0)
                    code and must have a CPT code assigned to it.
"KRN",19,1010,1,21,0)
 
"KRN",19,1010,1,22,0)
      3) Broad    - Procedure is mainly used by the receptionist when
"KRN",19,1010,1,23,0)
                    scheduling a patient for an exam.  It is used
"KRN",19,1010,1,24,0)
                    when he/she is not exactly sure which 'detailed' or
"KRN",19,1010,1,25,0)
                    'series' procedure will be performed. However,
"KRN",19,1010,1,26,0)
                    before the exam can be considered 'complete', the
"KRN",19,1010,1,27,0)
                    procedure must be changed to 'detailed' or 'series'.
"KRN",19,1010,1,28,0)
 
"KRN",19,1010,1,29,0)
                    If the 'division' parameter requiring a 'detailed'
"KRN",19,1010,1,30,0)
                    or 'series' procedure upon initial exam registration
"KRN",19,1010,1,31,0)
                    is set to 'yes', then the receptionist will not be
"KRN",19,1010,1,32,0)
                    allowed to select a 'broad' procedure.
"KRN",19,1010,1,33,0)
 
"KRN",19,1010,1,34,0)
       4) Parent  - Procedure is a "placeholder" used for ordering.  It
"KRN",19,1010,1,35,0)
                    does not have a CPT and cannot be registered.  Parent
"KRN",19,1010,1,36,0)
                    procedures must have one or more descendant procedures
"KRN",19,1010,1,37,0)
                    associated with them.  The descendants should be
"KRN",19,1010,1,38,0)
                    detailed procedures with valid CPT codes.  During
"KRN",19,1010,1,39,0)
                    Registration, the system automatically cycles through
"KRN",19,1010,1,40,0)
                    each descendant and asks if you want to register it.
"KRN",19,1010,1,41,0)
                    After each descendant is either registered or
"KRN",19,1010,1,42,0)
                    bypassed, the opportunity to add additional procedures
"KRN",19,1010,1,43,0)
                    is given.  All are registered under the same exam
"KRN",19,1010,1,44,0)
                    date/time.  Parent procedures can be set up to require
"KRN",19,1010,1,45,0)
                    a single report for all CPT's, or individual reports
"KRN",19,1010,1,46,0)
                    for each CPT.
