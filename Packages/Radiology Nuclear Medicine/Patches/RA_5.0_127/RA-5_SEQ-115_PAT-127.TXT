Description:
============

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Interagency Program Office (IPO)
 and the Department of Defense (DoD) is tasked by its charter with
 leading the Departments' efforts "to implement national health data
 standards for interoperability and [be] responsible for establishing,
 monitoring, and approving the clinical and technical standards profile
 and processes to ensure a seamless [exchange] of health data." This task
 of Native Domain standardization is aligned with achieving the goals
 outlined in the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requiring
 that the Departments' "healthcare data [are] computable in real-time and
 [comply] with existing national data standards" and that the "data [are]
 standardized as national standards continue to evolve."
  
 VA clinicians historically used non-standardized clinical terminologies
 which are inconsistent within the VA user community as well as within the
 currently accepted data standards as established by Office of the
 National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC).
 Implementation of Native Standardization will allow a streamlined method
 for data sharing, performing clinical decision support and engaging in
 national data reporting and analysis.  The VA has recently established a
 process for implementing standard terminology/terminologies within
 individual clinical domains for the exchange of data. The intent of this
 effort is to provide the detailed groundwork necessary for industry-wide
 interoperability. By providing a detailed analysis of the current state
 of the applicable domains and recommendations regarding the path forward,
 the Native Domain Standardization supports VA's efforts to remain at the
 forefront of healthcare data exchange.
 The local facility Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator
 (ADPAC) will need to associate the local procedure names in file #71
 to Gold Names in file #71.99.
  
 It will be necessary to develop a national standard of radiology
 procedures and map to their respective Current Procedural Terminology
 (CPT) code and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC)
 will be populated under the direction of the VHA Radiology Program
 Office prior to implementation of any of the data within these files.  The
 objective of this process is to enable the most user friendly interface as
 possible in the implementation of the native standardization along with
 all of the activities required to operationalize the change within the
 VistA environment and the associated terminology consuming applications.
 The Radiology ADPAC will match each active entry in the RAD/NUC MED
 PROCEDURES file (# 71) to an entry in the MASTER RADIOLOGY PROCEDURES file
 (#71.99) (MRPF).  This is all that is required outside the normal
 day-to-day operations.  When a new procedure is entered into the RAD/NUC
 MED PROCEDURES file (# 71) an email is automatically sent to the NEW
 TERMINOLOGY RAPID TURNAROUND (NTRT) team for the creation of a new entry
 in the MRPF.  The results of the NTRT process will be one of three
 possible results.  1) A new entry will be created in the MRPF and will
 be in the next file release.  2) A match was found in the MRPF and the
 facility should use that entry for a match.  3) There is no LOINC that
 matches this procedure and a request for a new LOINC has been submitted.
  
 An On Demand report is available to the VHA Radiology Program Office that
 will allow them to monitor new procedure creation activity.  A bulletin
 will be sent to a local mail group, the VHA Radiology Program Office, and
 NTRT when a new procedure reaches a specified number of days from
 creation and it has not been matched to a MASTER RADIOLOGY PROCEDURES
 file (# 71.99) entry.  While the MASTER RADIOLOGY PROCEDURES file
 (# 71.99) is locked down and cannot be changed at the local facility, the
 RAD/NUC MED PROCEDURES file (# 71) will remain accessible to the
 local facility.
  
 When creating a new procedure the RA PROCEDURE will use the
 NEW RAD PROCEDURE WORKUP file (#71.11) as the preliminary work area.
 When the procedure entry is complete a newly created procedure will
 be moved to the RAD/NUC MED PROCEDURES file (# 71) and then removed
 from the NEW RAD PROCEDURE WORKUP file (#71.11).
  
 ********************************************
  
 After installing this patch and after the MASTER RADIOLOGY PROCEDURE
 file (#71.99) is deployed to your facility there is an associated follow
 on informational patch (RA*5.0*134) that should be installed. The
 informational patch RA*5.0*134 provides instructions for turning on the
 sending of NTRT messages to the NTRT group.
  
  
 Related Patches
 ---------------
 XU*8*666, HDI*1.0*16, RA*5.0*127, RA*5.0*134
  
  
 Until all of the patches listed in the Related Patches section are
 installed and the MASTER RADIOLOGY PROCEDURES file (#71.99) (MRPF)
 content has been deployed to your facility the ADPAC will not have
 the ability to interact with the MRPF.
  
 The MASTER RADIOLOGY PROCEDURES file (#71.99), distributed with the
 patch is not populated.  Therefore, the options associated to this
 patch should not be used at this time.  In the future, the NTRT team
 will populate and deploy the MRPF file for all facilities.
 Prior to the MRPF file population being deployed the ADPAC should
 ignore all NTRT mailman messages that are generated until the sending
 of NTRT messages functionality is turned on.
  
 When the content of the MASTER RADIOLOGY PROCEDURES file (#71.99)
 has been deployed the NTRT group sends a message to the
 NTRT_NOTIFICATION-L listserv.
  
 The ADPAC for the facility shall subscribe to this list using the
 following web site: http://vaww.listserv.domain.ext/scripts/wa.exe.
 The NTRT group does not own the List Serve application.
 The List Serve is a VA service. The ADPAC will need to create an
 account using a username and password that does NOT synchronize with
 the ADPAC's VA network account.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
  
 There are no pre-installation actions.  For post-installation the
 MASTER RADIOLOGY SITE file (# 71.98) will be set with the facility number
 and a default of 30 days for the DAYS AFTER CREATION BULLETIN field.
 The RA NEW PROCEDURE TIME BULLETIN option will be queued to run daily
 at 3:00 a.m.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ==============================
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than
 5 minutes to install.  It is not necessary to disable any options.
 Prior to install the global ^RAMIS and the routines RAORD1, RAMAIN2
 should be backed up in case a backout is needed.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
  
 1.     Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.     Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3.     From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select

         following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the
         patch #(ex. RA*5.0*127):
  
 a.     Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
         not backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
 b.     Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         (allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
       is installed.  It compares all components of this patch routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
  
 c.     Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
 4.     From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option
         and choose the patch to install.
  
 5.     When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
         Install? YES//' 
         Rebuild the menu trees as one option has been modified and one
         option added.
  
 6.     When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         NO//'
  
 7.     When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
         and Protocols? NO//'

 Patch Backout Plan
 ==================
 Please contact the product development team for assistance if the
  installed patch that needs to be backed out contains anything at all
  besides routines before trying to backout the patch. If the installed
  patch that needs to be backed out includes a pre or post install
  routine, please contact the product development team before
  attempting the backout. 
  
 From the Kernel Installation and Distribution
 System Menu, select the Installation Menu. From
 this menu, you may elect to use the following option.
 When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch #.
   
 a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create
    a backup message of any routines exported with this
    patch. It will not backup any other changes such as
    DD's or templates. 
 The rollback procedure for VistA patches is complicated and may
 require a follow-on patch to fully roll back to the pre-patch state.
 This is due to the possibility of Data Dictionary updates, Data updates,
 cross references, and transmissions from VistA to offsite data stores. 
 Please contact the product development team for assistance if needed.
