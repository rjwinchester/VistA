Subject: RADIATION DOSE MOP-UP

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch will address the (3) following issues:
  
 1. An undefined error occurs in the VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine
    package when calling the Imaging Application Programming Interface
    (API) while using Importer III.
  
 2. The Exam Profile with Radiation Dosage Data [RA PROFRAD DOSE] option 
    was impacted by the 'inefficient patient lookup for radiation dose
    patients' and a 'column header for our report was misspelled'.
  
 3. Data dictionary update: RADIATION ABSORBED DOSE (#70.3) file.

 Issue 1:
 --------
 1. An undefined error occurs in the VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine
    package when calling the Imaging Application Programming Interface
    (API) while using Importer III.
  
 Corrective Action for Issue 1:
 ------------------------------
 1. Check for the existence of the variable RADTE. Set RADTE if it is not 
    defined with the (GETDOSE^RADUTL) call. 
  
 Issue 2:
 --------
 The Exam Profile with Radiation Dosage Data [RA PROFRAD DOSE] option was 
 impacted by the following:
 1. Inefficient patient lookup. Radiation dose patients are not presented
    to the user in a timely manner.
  
 2. A column header for our report was misspelled. "Assession" is the 
    column header in question.
  
 Corrective Actions for Issue 2:
 -------------------------------
 1. The inefficient patient lookup was corrected by using a cross 
    reference identifying VistA RIS patients with a radiation dose history.
    The MIX^DIC1 call was used to use this specific cross reference to
    increase the efficiency of the patient lookup.
  
 2. "Assession" was corrected to "Accession."
  
 Issue 3:
 --------
 Data dictionary update: RADIATION ABSORBED DOSE (#70.3) file.
  
 1. The precision of the data returned from the modalities was greater than
    the tolerances allowed by the RADIATION ABSORBED DOSE (#70.3) file.
  
 2. The AIR KERMA AREA PRODUCT (#.06 field) identified the units for data
    as being 'Gy-cm2'. This unit measurement is incorrect.
  
 Corrective Actions for Issue 3:
 -------------------------------
 1. Increase the tolerance for the following fields in the RADIATION 
    ABSORBED DOSE (#70.3) file: AIR KERMA (#.05), AIR KERMA AREA PRODUCT 
    (#.06), CTDIvol (#4), and DLP (#5) to accept the greatest tolerance
    allowed by FileMan (nine digits to the right of the decimal point).
  
    ==================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====================
    Note: An environment check will run prior to the loading and 
     installation of patch RA*5.0*119. The intent of the check is to
     ensure that there is no radiation dose data on file in either the
     VistA Imaging and the VistA Radiology databases. If the environment
     check routine finds rad dose data the loading and/or installation of
     the patch is prohibited.
  
     In order to purge rad dose data the installing site will have to file
     a support ticket to the national support team. In this case that
     would be Clinical Support III (Clin III). After that ticket is filed,
     it will be referred to national radiology development where personnel
     will require access to the production account to purge the data. A
     locally namespaced routine will be required to install on the host
     system with the rad dose data.
  
  
  All Radiology users should be off the system at the time of installation 
  of RA*5.0*119. This includes all voice recognition activity. 
  Installation of this patch should complete in under two minutes.
  
   1. Load Transport Global
     ---------------------
     Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
     INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.

  3. Select Installation Option:
     ---------------------------
     NOTE:  The following are OPTIONAL - (When prompted for the INSTALL
            NAME, enter RA*5*119:
   
     a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
     b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
         the components of the KIDS build.
     c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
  4. Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
