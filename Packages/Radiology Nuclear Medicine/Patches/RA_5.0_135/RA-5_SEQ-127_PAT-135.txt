Description:
============

 *** RA*5.0*135 is a patch developed in response to the Deputy Under  ***
 *** Secretary for Health for Operations and Management (10N)         ***
 *** directive: '7806589 - SD Memo Radiology and Nuclear Medicine     ***
 *** orders Management' dated September 11, 2017.                     ***
  
 Note: RA*5.0*135 (RA5P135) will discontinue older orders in the VistA 
 Radiology/Nuclear Medicine and CPRS applications. Though every measure 
 was taken to eliminate the burden on the host system by disabling 
 radiology notifications, one CPRS notification, DC ORDER (#62), 
 is beyond our control. Having the DC ORDER notification enabled 
 has the potential to generate thousands of alerts. Since this particular 
 CPRS notification was exported nationally as 'Disabled' we believe that
 the alert will only be generated to individual end users or teams who 
 have selectively enabled the DC ORDER notification. Because of this,
 we strongly suggest that the installers or appropriate personnel inform
 your Radiology and CPRS Clinical Applications Coordinators for awareness. 
  
 We are also providing the following fileman sort that can be run 
 immediately to determine which end users actually have the CPRS 
 DC ORDER notification enabled and therefore, could possibly receive a 
 CPRS DC ORDER notification from this patch installation.
  
 We suggest you provide the fileman output beforehand to your
 sites CPRS Clinical Coordinators for their awareness. If, by chance, 
 after patch installation an end user receives/complains of many 
 DC ORDER notifications, Clinical Coordinators could offer to quickly 
 erase just those notifications for the end user using the 
 Erase Notifications [ORB3 ERASE NOTIFICATIONS] menu option.
  
  
 FILEMAN PRINT TO FIND END USERS WITH DC ORDER NOTIFICATION ENABLED
 ========================================================================
  
 Notes:  
 1. Make sure to enter the following fields, including all alpha-numeric
    characters.  
 2. Be sure to use the proper Case because some of these values are 
    case sensitive.
 3. Some of these users may be inactive, based on their last sign on 
    date/time.
 4. Please give the fileman output to your sites clinical application
    coordinators.

 If a user happened to get a lot of DC ORDER notifications after the Auto 
 Discontinue task completes, your site's Clinical Coordinator could use the
 Erase Notifications [ORB3 ERASE NOTIFICATIONS] menu option to remove the
 DC ORDER notifications that the user received, otherwise the user would 
 need to process the DC Order alert in CPRS like they do with any other
 alert.
  
 Here is an example using the Erase Notifications [ORB3 ERASE 
 NOTIFICATIONS] menu option to remove all the DC ORDER notifications for a
 user:
  
 Erase Notifications
  
     1. Erase all notifications for a User
     2. Erase all notifications for a Patient
     3. Erase all instances of a notification (regardless of Patient or 
        User)
     4. Erase specific notifications for a User  <<<<<<<<<<<<  THIS ITEM
     5. Edit Erase All Notifications parameter for a User 
  
 Select Erase option:  4   <<<<<
  
 This option purges an existing alert/notification for a recipient/user.

  The VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine application (RIS) will be 
 automating the discontinuation of radiology orders that fall within a 
 specific 'DATE DESIRED (Not guaranteed)' date/time range. All orders 
 between the date of package inception through May 31st 2015 with request 
 status values of 'Pending', 'Hold' & 'Scheduled' are in play regarding 
 discontinuation.
  
 This work is based on a Central Office (CO) directive to the RIS 
 ('ancillary') and the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).
  
 RA*5.0*135 will take the following approach:
  
 Three processes A, B & C will be scheduled to run. Process A consists
 of two parts.
  
 Process A:
 ----------
 1) Index the 'DATE DESIRED (Not guaranteed)' in the "BDD" index for all
    the records in the RAD/NUC MED ORDERS (#75.1) file. This part will
    be tasked to run in the background.
 2) Process A, part two will re-compile all the impacted compiled input
    templates for file 75.1 including the 'DATE DESIRED (Not guaranteed)'
    field. This part will run in real time.
  
 Process B:
 ----------
    Schedule the RA AUTO DISCONTINUE PROCESS option to run at different
    times depending on the type of account. If the account is a test 
    account, the option is scheduled to run one hour in the future. If
    the account is a production account, the option is scheduled to run the
    next day at 21:00 hours. Starting at 21:00 hours will minimize user 
    inconvenience.
  
    There are two parameters with the RA AUTO DISCONTINUE PROCESS. The
    first is that all radiology orders with a DATE DESIRED (not guaranteed)
    date between the date of package inception and midnight May 31st 2015
    are orders identified as being discontinued. The second parameter is
    the REQUEST STATUS (#.05) of the order. This parameter is conditional
    depending on the REQUEST STATUS value.
     * All orders with REQUEST STATUS values of 'Pending' or 'Hold' those
       orders will be assigned a request status of 'Discontinued'.
     * If an order has a REQUEST STATUS value of 'Scheduled', the SCHEDULED
       DATE (TIME optional) (#23) field value must be midnight May 31st
       2015 or earlier to have the order discontinued. 
  
    The discontinuation process will be queued for the day after RA*5.0*135
    is installed, at 21:00 hours. This will give the discontinuation
    (DC) process enough time to complete in quiet mode (CPRS notifications
    & RIS bulletins being disabled) before the next day begins.
  
    Note: while the discontinue task is being run the following RIS 
    options will be set 'Out of Order':
     * Cancel a Request [RA ORDERCANCEL]
     * Hold a Request [RA ORDERHOLD]
   
    RA ORDERCANCEL & RA ORDERHOLD will be set back in order when the 
    tasked option stops running.
  
    An email will be sent to the following recipients: POSTMASTER and
    members of the RA REQUEST CANCELLED mail group. This email will
    contain the date/time the DC process started, finished and the number
    of order records DC'd.
  
 Process C
 ---------
 This last tasked process will kill off the existing "AS" cross reference 
 (xref) on the REQUEST STATUS (#5) field of the RAD/NUC MED ORDERS (#75.1) 
 file. The "AS" xref was last updated in patch RA*5.0*130 but the xref was
 not rebuilt. As a result, bad data in the "AS" xref will cause a patient
 to appear in the 'Pending/Hold Rad/Nuc Med Request Log' [RA ORDERPENDING]
 option.
  
  
 Other actions taken by RA*5.0*135
 ---------------------------------
 * Every order discontinued in the RIS will be discontinued in CPRS.
  
 * After the discontinuation process has successfully completed, RIS 
   bulletins and CPRS notifications will be re-enabled.
  
 * For all the orders discontinued by RA*5.0*135 a generic cancel reason
   'OBSOLETE ORDER-P135 (automated)' will be associated with the order.
  
 * POSTMASTER will be the "person" who discontinued (DC'd) the orders in
   both the RIS and CPRS.
  
 * The 'OBSOLETE ORDER-P135 (automated)' cancel reason will not be 
   selectable by the user when exercising the 'Cancel a Request' [RA 
   ORDERCANCEL] option.

 Backout/Roll-back strategy
 ==========================
 Note: Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation 
 of the development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between
 development team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA
 personnel. A national help desk ticket should be logged before attempting
 any backout procedure.
  
 If the discontinue process is not running use the Taskman Management menu 
 to run the 'Schedule/Unschedule Options' option
 to unschedule 'RA AUTO DISCONTINUE PROCESS'
  
 If the discontinue process is running use the Taskman Management menu to 
 run the 'Delete Tasks' option
 to unschedule 'RA AUTO DISCONTINUE PROCESS'. The task ID will be 
 available by viewing the installation record for patch RA*5.0*135.
  
 Since three of the four routines are new, restore RABUL to its 
 pre-RA*5.0*135 version and delete routines: RAIPR135, RAIPS135 and 
 RAUTODC.
