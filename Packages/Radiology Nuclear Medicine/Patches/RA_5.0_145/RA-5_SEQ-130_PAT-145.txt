Description:
============

 This patch will address the following issue:

 1. R18589477FY18 - Multiple errors in error trap. <UNDEFINED>EN1+63^RAO7RO
  
 Problem:
 -------
 An imaging order is placed in CPRS GUI. When the order is signed, it sends
 the order to the Radiology package by a HL7 message. If the HL7 message 
 does not have an Imaging Location included in the OBR message segment, an
 Imaging Location will be located by using the location defined for the
 Imaging Type. If this location has a REQUEST PRINTER NAME defined, but has
 never had RAD/NUC MED DIVISION defined, the routine RAO7RO will generate a
 system error.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The data for the IMAGING LOCATIONS (#79.1) file is stored in the ^RA(79.1,
 global. The RAD/NUC MED DIVISION (#25) field is stored in the global node:
 ^RA(79.1,D0,"DIV"). A variable is set to the data value stored in this
 node. If this node does not exist, the setting of the variable will fail,
 generating the hard system error. Routine RAO7RO will be modified to
 determine if this node exist. If it does not exist, the variable will set
 to a null value.
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 Beckley VA Medical Center, WV
 Martinsburg VA Medical Center, WV
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ========================== 
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 2 
 minutes to install.
  
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
    the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the 
    following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch #
    RA*5.0*145:
          
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
         (allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option 
    and choose the patch to install.
  
 5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
    NO//', respond NO.
  
 6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
    and Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
