 SDM TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ====================
 1. I14066990FY17 - <UNDEFINED>PRT+13^RARTE5
  
    Problem 1:
    ----------
    The user selects the Outside Report Entry/Edit [RA OUTSIDE RRTENTRY]
    option. Enters a Case Number and then the user realizes the wrong 
    case has been selected. The user will enter a '^' at the Select 
    'Standard' Report to Copy: prompt to exit. An UNDEFINED variable 
    error is generated and the user is forced out of VISTA.
  
    Resolution 1:
    -------------
    When the user enters a '^' at the "Select 'Standard' Report to Copy:"
    prompt two seperate issues but related issues happen. A logic flow
    control variable, RAXIT, is set to a quit condition and then 
    overwritten. Variable RABIREQ is not defined. Both will generate
    a hard error and force the user out of VistA.
  
    Modification of routine RARTE5 to protect the variable RAXIT from being
    overwritten.
  
    Routines: RARTE5
  
 2. I14376092FY17 - SBY-Error Message: Report Designer HL7 Logs are
                    not updating to Vista
  
    Problem 2:
    ----------
    When a v2.4 HL7 report is broadcast to the VistA M server, the segments
    and fields from that message are de-constructed and processed. It is 
    assumed that the Universal Service ID (OBR-4) will have a value. A 
    value may not always be assigned. Before this patch, the software
    lapsed into an error condition because it does not have a result
    status. After this patch the software will identify the missing Result
    Status value and exit without error.
  
    Resolution 2:
    -------------
    RAHLTCPX will be updated to check for the array element PAR(4) and if
    it is undefined, the software will negatively acknowledge ('NAK') the
    inbound HL7 v2.4 ORU message.
  
    Routine: RAHLTCPX 
  
 =================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =====================
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
  This patch cannot be installed with Radiology/Nuclear Medicine users on
  the system. This patch should take less than five minutes to install.
   
  All VistA Radiology users are to be off the system. Voice Recognition 
  and Radiology based PACS activities are to be paused while RA*5.0*141 is
  installed.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------  
  1. Stop entering radiology orders through CPRS and the Radiology/Nuclear 
     Medicine application.
  
  2. Shutdown HL7 messaging between the VistA RIS and non-VistA RIS 
     applications, by using the "Filer and Link Management Options [menu]".
  
  3. Choose the PacMan message containing this patch.
  
  4. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
  5. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
     the Installation menu.
   
  6. From this menu, you may select to use the following options:
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter RA*5.0*141)
   
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
   
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
   
  7. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package RA*5.0*141.
   
  8. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//",
     respond NO.
  
  9. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? NO//", respond NO.
  
  10. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes): (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0.
            
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch. It is imperative that you have performed a
 backup of the routine included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created. To
 verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch description.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
  Restart HL7 messaging between the VistA RIS and non-VistA RIS
  applications, by using the "Filer and Link Management Options [menu]".
      
  Resume entering radiology order through CPRS and the 
  Radiology/Nuclear Medicine application.
  
  The installation of RA*5.0*141 is complete.
