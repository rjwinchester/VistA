Description:
============

 RA*5.0*124 will address nine issues:
 -------------------------------------
 1. A bug in the VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine application (referred to 
    from this point forward Radiology Information System or 'RIS') allows
    the user to edit a study using the 'Case No. Exam Edit' [RA EDITCN] &
    'Edit Exam by Patient' and change the procedure of the study after the
    study has moved to an examination status of 'Complete'.
    
    PSPO 2658, I6535839FY16, I6499976FY16 & R19382906FY18
  
 2. The option 'Cancel an Exam' [RA CANCEL] relies on user input to 
    properly run to completion. Prior to this patch, the software cancels 
    the study. It then continues to ask the user for a technologist 
    comment, reason for cancellation and 'Do you want to cancel the request
    associated with this exam?'. At this point the study has been canceled.
    If the user does not enter a reply in the proper amount of time, the 
    option times out and exits. This leaves the study cancelled and the 
    the orders in the RIS and CPRS active. The orders and study statuses 
    are now out of synchronization ('synch').
    
    PSPO 2658, I8454979FY16, I6535839FY16, I6499976FY16 & R19382906FY18
  
 3. The Radiology 'Delinquent Status Report' and 'Incomplete Exam
    Report' do not exit the report when an up-arrow is entered by the user
    when asked for input by the end of screen (EOS) prompt.
  
 4. A new VistA RIS Security Key, RA UNVERIFY, will be distributed with
    this patch. This key will be required for a user to run the 'Unverify a
    Report for Amendment' [RA UNVERIFY] option. RA UNVERIFY will supercede
    all keys used to lock the 'Unverify a Report for Amendment' option
    prior to the release of RA*5.0*124. This key will be exported with the
    patch and tied directly to the 'Unverify a Report for Amendment'
    option.
  
    Requested by VACO
  
 5. The Bay Pines Radiology Package and the DSS Extract files for 
    Managerial Cost Accounting are not matching the volume of Radiology 
    Procedures collected. In the Rad/Nuc Med Report file (#74), there is a 
    'Other Case#' field that seems to duplicate the original case number.
  
    The DSS developer has confirmed the issue, and contacted Radiology who 
    indicated that the case number that appears in the file should never be
    repeated in the 'Other Case#' multiple.
  
    SN/INC0055540
  
 6. The option 'RA AUTO DISCONTINUE PROCESS' exported and run with 
    RA*5.0*135 will be deleted from test and production accounts.
  
 7. A software correction is made to the routine RARTE1 (PACS tag).
  
 8. There is an issue with reports being amended when using voice 
    recognition. It appears that on occasion that amended reports are
    not being updated correctly. The original version of the report is not
    being stored off and the activity log for that report does not show
    that the report has been backed down from a verified status, amended
    and then re-verified. This patch will address this issue.
    
    SN/INC0654877, SN/INC0924671
  
 9. This patch deletes the traditional "AE" and "AS" cross-references on
    the EXAM STATUS field (#3) on the EXAMINATIONS (70.03) sub-file. The
    "AE" and "AS" cross-references are rebuilt as new-style cross
    references.

 Backout/Roll-back strategy
 ==========================
 Note: Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation
 of the development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision 
 between development team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate
 VA personnel. A national help desk ticket should be logged before
 attempting any backout procedure.
  
 If you have backed up the components documented under the 'Backup 
 requirements prior to patch installation' section the roll-back will be 
 ready to go when your national help desk ticket is answered.
