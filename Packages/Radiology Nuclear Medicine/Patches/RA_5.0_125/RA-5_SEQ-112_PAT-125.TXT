Subject: THE PARENT TRAP; RETURN TO SENDER & HL7 RESEND

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issues:
  
 1. Correct a bug in the way the 'Incomplete Exam Report' handles 
    descendant studies.
 2. Correct the bug issue in routine RAHLR1 which leaves the procedure 
    flag variable being defined. 
 3. HL7 applications thought to be excluded also receive v2.4 HL7 messages.
 4. Correct the voice recognition duplicate message issue.

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1. INC000001287775 - Radiology - HL7 Issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A bug in the 'Incomplete Exam Report' [RA INCOMPLETE] option incorrectly 
 handles the descendant studies associated with exam sets or print sets. 
 The variable RACN in routine RADLQ3 is incorrectly reset to the site 
 specific accession number, preventing the $O from performing as intended.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Within routine RADLQ3, the variable RACN is preserved by the NEW
 command.
  
 Routine: RADLQ3
    
 2. INC000001239118 - 6 Radiology - HL7 Issue: Messages
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A bug in routine RAHLR1 leaves a parent procedure flag variable
 defined after series of descendant studies has been built into Health
 Level Seven (HL7) v2.4 Order (ORM) messages. These ORM messages are 
 then broadcast to other HL7 subscribers with the erroneous parent 
 procedure flag.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Clear the parent procedure flag for each study prior to executing the
 parent procedure function to build v2.4 HL7 ORM messages.
  
 Routine: RAHLR1
   
 3. INC000000944315 - Radiology - HL7 Issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user executes the 'Resend Radiology HL7 Messages By Date 
 Range' [RA HL7 RESEND BY DATE RANGE] option, the HL7 applications thought 
 to be excluded also receive v2.4 HL7 messages.
            
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine RAHLRU will be updated to include the software 
 responsible for excluding all non-user selected HL7 applications from
 receiving rebroadcast v2.4 HL7 messages.
   
 Note:
 -----
 'Resend Radiology HL7 Messages By Date Range' allows the user to 
 select the HL7 Application, in this case the receiving application, to
 messages to be re-broadcast. This option does not look at the HL7 version 
 when deciding which subscribers receive re-broadcast HL7 messages.
  
 Routine: RAHLRU
   
 4. R6223790FY16 - Radiology Service HL7 work 6. WAS | Vista needs to stop 
                   re-broadcasting to the original sender.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The voice recognition vendor that initiated the broadcast of the
 v2.4 HL7 ORU to the VistA Radiology has that same message broadcast back
 to them. This is a result of the voice recognition vendor initiating the
 broadcast being a subscriber to VistA Radiology side ORU v2.4 report
 events.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 VistA Radiology will add the functionality to identify
 the HL7 sending application of the v2.4 HL7 ORU HL7 message from our 
 vendor and exclude that voice recognition vendor from the list of
 subscribers.
  
 Routine: RAHLRU
  
     ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
  This patch cannot be installed with Radiology/Nuclear Medicine users on
  the system. This patch should take less than five minutes to install.
   
  All VistA Radiology users are to be off the system. Voice Recognition 
  and Radiology based PACS activities are to be paused while RA*5.0*125 is
  installed.
   
  1. Shutdown HL7 messaging between the VistA RIS and non-VistA RIS 
     applications, by using the "Filer and Link Management Options [menu]".
  
  2. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
     option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
   
  3. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
     system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
   
  4. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
     select the 'Installation' menu.
   
  5. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
     that all routines have the correct checksums.
   
  6. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
     options:
             Print Transport Global
             Compare Transport Global to Current System
             Backup a Transport Global
   
        Preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch prior to
        installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' option
        at this time. You may also compare the routines in your production
        account to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare a
        Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  7. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
     and select the package 'RA*5.0*125.
   
     When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//, 
     choose 'NO'.
   
     When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? NO//', choose YES.
      
     When prompted, 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of order':', 
     enter the following options:
      
     Disable the following VistA RIS options:
     ----------------------------------------
     Exam Entry/Edit Menu            [RA EXAMEDIT]
     Incomplete Exam Report          [RA INCOMPLETE]
     Delinquent Status Report        [RA DELINQUENT]
     Resend Radiology HL7 Message    [RA HL7 MESSAGE RESEND]
     Resend Radiology HL7 Messages By Date Range [RA HL7 RESEND BY 
     DATE RANGE]
      
  
  8. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//', respond 0.
  
  
  
   ==================== Post-Installation Instructions ====================
     Restart HL7 messaging between the VistA RIS and non-VistA RIS
     applications, by using the "Filer and Link Management Options [menu]".
  
  The installation of RA*5.0*125 is complete.
