Subject: CORRECT ABNORMAL NOTATION IN CPRS REPORT LIST

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 On the reports tab in CPRS, Imaging (Local Only) displays a list of
 radiology reports for a patient. Included in that list is an 'abnormal' 
 notation if the report has a primary Radiology diagnosis code that has
 been designated to 'Generate Abnormal Alert' in file DIAGNOSTIC codes
 (#78.3). Currently, the system only looks at the Primary Diagnosis code
 and does not examine the Secondary Diagnosis codes to determine if the
 'abnormal' notation needs to display.

 INC0000001113213 - Reports: Report Status display on CPRS tab
  
  Patient Safety Issue:
  ---------------------
  PSPO #2780
       
  Problem:
  --------
  In CPRS (reports tab), when a list of Radiology Reports are displayed for
  Imaging(Local Only), the code in routine RAO7PC1A only looks at the
  Primary Diagnosis code in the report to determine if an 'abnormal'
  notation needs to be made on that list.
        
  Resolution:
  -----------     
  A modification will be made in routine RAO7PC1A to examine the Secondary
  diagnosis codes  in a Radiology Report as well as the Primary to
  determine if the 'abnormal' notation is needed for a specific report.
  
  Routine: RAO7PC1A
