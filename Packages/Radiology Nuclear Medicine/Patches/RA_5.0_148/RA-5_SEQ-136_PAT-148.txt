Subject: AUTOMATICALLY CREATE A COMMUNITY CARE CONSULT FROM EXISTING IMAGING ORDER

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The RA*5*148 patch adds a new option, Radiology/Nuclear Med Order Entry 
 Menu [RA ORDERREF], to the Radiology/Nuclear Med Order Entry Menu [RA
 ORDER] option. This new option allows a Radiology Technician, within 
 VistA, to select imaging orders with a status of Pending, Hold, or 
 Scheduled and create a consult order from that imaging order, 
 automatically sign the consult order which creates a consult, and the 
 consult is submitted to community care. 
  
 Seven consult services are created for use in this process. Please see 
 the post-install instructions below for important steps to be taken in 
 order for the software to work.
  
 The patch includes a post-install routine, RA148PST, that searches for 
 consults that were created for earlier versions of these seven consult 
 services that might have existed when the name of each of them was 
 slightly different and changes them as follows:
  
 COMMUNITY CARE IMAGING-CT-AUTO changed to COMMUNITY CARE-IMAGING CT-AUTO
 COMMUNITY CARE IMAGING-MAMMOGRAPHY DIAGNOSTIC-AUTO changed to COMMUNITY 
 CARE-IMAGING MAMMOGRAPHY DIAGNOSTIC-AUTO
 COMMUNITY CARE IMAGING-MAMMOGRAPHY SCREEN-AUTO changed to COMMUNITY 
 CARE-IMAGING MAMMOGRAPHY SCREEN-AUTO
 COMMUNITY CARE IMAGING-MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING-AUTO changed to 
 COMMUNITY CARE-IMAGING MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING-AUTO
 COMMUNITY CARE IMAGING-NUCLEAR MEDICINE-AUTO changed to COMMUNITY 
 CARE-IMAGING NUCLEAR MEDICINE-AUTO
 COMMUNITY CARE IMAGING-GENERAL RADIOLOGY-AUTO changed to COMMUNITY 
 CARE-IMAGING GENERAL RADIOLOGY-AUTO
 COMMUNITY CARE IMAGING-ULTRASOUND-AUTO changed to COMMUNITY CARE-IMAGING 
 ULTRASOUND-AUTO
  
 Please see the Pre/Post Installation Overview and the Post-Installation 
 Instructions sections below for more details of RA148PST.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ------------------------------
 Please note that there are two important manual steps to be taken that 
 are outlined in the Post-Installation Instructions below. 
  
 1. The first set of steps need to be executed after the install by 
    Clinical Application Coordinator (CAC)/ Health Informatics Specialist 
    (HIS). After install, please notify them to perform the
    Post-Installation Instructions. If the Post-Installation Instructions
    are not executed, the software will not work.
  
 2. There is a post-install routine, R148PST, that queues a TaskMan job to 
    run in the background. The Patch Installer needs to verify they receive
    a MailMan message when the TaskMan job finishes. Please refer to the
    Post-Installation Instructions section below for more details. 
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize

 2. Step 2 of the Post-Installation Instructions should be verified by the
    Patch Installer that a MailMan message is received upon completion of
    the TaskMan job. There is a post-install routine, R148PST, that queues
    a TaskMan job to run in the background. This routine searches file #123
    (REQUEST/CONSULTATION) for any consults that were made after 1/1/2018  
    that have a reference in field 1 (REASON FOR ACTION), in field .8
    (ORDER ACTIONS multiple) of file #100 (ORDER) that contains a certain
    service name and changes it as follows:
  
    COMMUNITY CARE IMAGING-CT-AUTO will be changed to COMMUNITY 
    CARE-IMAGING CT-AUTO
    COMMUNITY CARE IMAGING-MAMMOGRAPHY DIAGNOSTIC-AUTO will be changed to
    COMMUNITY CARE-IMAGING MAMMOGRAPHY DIAGNOSTIC-AUTO
    COMMUNITY CARE IMAGING-MAMMOGRAPHY SCREEN-AUTO will be changed to 
    COMMUNITY CARE-IMAGING MAMMOGRAPHY SCREEN-AUTO
    COMMUNITY CARE IMAGING-MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING-AUTO will be
    changed to COMMUNITY CARE-IMAGING MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING-AUTO
    COMMUNITY CARE IMAGING-NUCLEAR MEDICINE-AUTO will be changed to 
    COMMUNITY CARE-IMAGING NUCLEAR MEDICINE-AUTO
    COMMUNITY CARE IMAGING-GENERAL RADIOLOGY-AUTO will be changed to 
    COMMUNITY CARE-IMAGING GENERAL RADIOLOGY-AUTO
    COMMUNITY CARE IMAGING-ULTRASOUND-AUTO will be changed to COMMUNITY 
    CARE-IMAGING ULTRASOUND-AUTO
  
    For every record that is found and changed, an entry will be made in 
    an extended temporary file named ^XTMP("RA148PST MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS
    AM/PM NNNN") where MM/DD/2018 is the date of install, HH:MM:SS AM/PM
    is the time that the post-install started, and NNNN is the MUMPS job
    number. The file will be purged 90 days after creation.
  
    Example 1:
    ^XTMP("RA148PST 10/18/2018 10:03:55 pm
    12666",0)="3190116.220355^3181018.220355^List of ORDER ACTION records
    in file #100 where the name of the consult service was changed"
    ^XTMP("RA148PST 10/18/2018 10:03:55 pm 12666",1)="1. RAPATIENT,ONE 
    Order IEN:8558330 Consult to Service/Specialty changed:"
    ^XTMP("RA148PST 10/18/2018 10:03:55 pm 12666",2)="  from COMMUNITY 
    CARE IMAGING-MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING-AUTO to COMMUNITY CARE-IM
    AGING MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING-AUTO"
    ^XTMP("RA148PST 10/18/2018 10:03:55 pm 12666",3)="2. RAPATIENT,ONE 
    Order IEN:8558331 Consult to Service/Specialty changed:"
    ^XTMP("RA148PST 10/18/2018 10:03:55 pm 12666",4)="  from COMMUNITY 
    CARE IMAGING-NUCLEAR MEDICINE-AUTO to COMMUNITY CARE-IMAGING NUCL
    EAR MEDICINE-AUTO"
    ^XTMP("RA148PST 10/18/2018 10:03:55 pm 12666",5)="3. RAPATIENT,ONE 
    Order IEN:8558332 Consult to Service/Specialty changed:"
    ^XTMP("RA148PST 10/18/2018 10:03:55 pm 12666",6)="  from COMMUNITY 
    CARE IMAGING-CT-AUTO to COMMUNITY CARE-IMAGING CT-AUTO"
    
    And, at the end is a record that shows how many, if any, records were
    changed:
    ^XTMP("RA148PST 10/18/2018 10:03:55 pm 12666",147)="End of run: 73 
    records found and changed"
    
    Example 2:
    ^XTMP("RA148PST 11/26/2018 10:44:12 am 
    23396",0)="3190224.104412^3181126.104412^List of ORDER ACTION records
    in file #100 where the name of the consult service was changed"
    ^XTMP("RA148PST 11/26/2018 10:44:12 am 23396",1)="No records found 
    that needed changing"
    
    PLEASE NOTE: Since only three IOC sites had used the old version of 
    RA*5.0*148 that created these consults, it is anticipated that most 
    sites will have zero records.
  
    When the post-install tasks finishes, it will also send an email 
    message to the installer with the final record. Patch Installer needs
    to verify they receive the message when the post-install task
    finishes.
  
    Example 1:
    Subj: RA*5.0*148 Post-install  [#328936] 12/04/18@16:11  2 lines
    From: INSTALLER,ONE  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    RA*5.0*148 - the background job has finished changing the consult 
    records.
    No records were changed.
  
    Example 2:
    Subj: RA*5.0*148 Post-install  [#328936] 12/04/18@16:11  2 lines
    From: INSTALLER,ONE  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    RA*5.0*148 - the background job has finished changing the consult 
    records.
    73 records were changed.
  
  
 Backout Plan:
 ------------
 This patch contains four RA routines.  The decision to back-out or 
 rollback software will be a joint decision between development team, VA 
 site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of 
 install).The message containing the backed-up routines can be loaded with 
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman 
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed-up 
 routines onto the VistA System. 
   
 Go to the Backup of Patch_RA*5.0*148 message in Mailman. 
 At the Enter message action prompt, enter "X" to "Xtract PackMan" 
 At the Select PackMan Function prompt enter the number 6 to Install/Check

 At the end of this process the pre-patch routines are restored.
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
 ----------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the four RA routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print  [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the 
 RA*5.0*148 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 routines will no longer contain the designation of patch RA*5.0*148 in 
 the patch list section on line 2.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
     
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
    
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
    
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
    
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
