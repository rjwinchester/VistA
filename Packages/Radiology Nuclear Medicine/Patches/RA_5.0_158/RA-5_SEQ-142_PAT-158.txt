Subject:  RA COMMON PROCEDURE UPDATES & REASON STANDARDIZATION/LOCKDOWN

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 Issue one: Changing the name of an active common procedure to the name of
 another non-common radiology procedure of the same imaging type corrupts
 the ORDERABLE ITEMS [#101.43] file record.
  
 Solution one: Prevent the editing of a common procedure name if that 
 common procedure is active.
  
 --- 
  
 Issue two: If a front door order is signed and the order is comprised of a
 a series procedure and one or more procedure modifiers (PMODs) with the
 AMIS CREDIT INDICATORS field defined that order is rejected by the RIS.
  
 Solution two: AMIS is no longer user to track workload. The series 
 procedure/PMODs with the AMIS CREDIT INDICATOR field check has been 
 removed.
  
 ---
  
 Issue three: The 'ORIGINAL PROCEDURE?' [#8] field of the RAD/NUC MED 
 PROCEDURE [#71] file whose original purpose was to prevent the procedure 
 from being modified. 
  
 Solution three: The 'ORIGINAL PROCEDURE?' designation is no longer a 
 business rule to be enforced.  A post-init will be tasked to remove the 
 'ORIGINAL PROCEDURE?' flag from procedure records.
  
 --- 
  
 Issue four: To add new national cancel reason data to the RAD/NUC MED 
 REASON [#75.2] file, to standardize and to lock down the file.
  
 Solution four: Add the new data to file 75.2. Remove all local reasons 
 from being selected by the user. Lock down file 75.2 so only those with 
 '@' can edit it.
  
 Removing the RA REASON EDIT Option from file 19.
  
 NAME: RA REASON EDIT                    MENU TEXT: Reason Edit
   TYPE: run routine                     CREATOR: XXXXX,XXXX
 DESCRIPTION:   This option allows ADPACs to modify and add reasons that 
 can be selected by users who are cancelling and holding Imaging orders.

 Issue five: After the conversion from Radiology HL7 version 2.3 to 2.4 the
 printset indicator on order (ORM) messages broadcast to our subscribers is
 not valid.
  
 Solution five: Update ORC-4 on our ORM 2.4 HL7 messages that the study is 
 part of a printset.

   =================  Pre-Installation Instructions ==================
   ***IMPORTANT***: Back up the RAD/NUC MED REASON [#75.2] data global
   data; this step is necessary if the data must be restored.
  
   Back up data files using your site's policy for backing up data.
   If the steps are unknown, follow the instructions below:
  
   This backup file will be small but make sure space is available
   before proceeding:
   It should take less than five minutes to create the backup file.
  
     1) Go to a command prompt.
     2) At the prompt, enter D GOGEN^%ZSPECIAL.
     3) At the device prompt, enter the name of the local directory where
        the file is to be stored with the name of the file.
        Example: VA1$:[SITEDIR]PRE_RA5P158_RA_REASON_752_BKUP_YYYYMMDD.GBL
     4) At the Parameters? Prompt, press <enter>.
     5) At the Global prompt, enter the file global below
  
                 RAD/NUC MED REASON    #75.2   ^RA(75.2,
  
     6) Verify that the file was created and exists in the directory
        specified
  
        Example:
        VISTA>d GOGEN^%ZSPECIAL
  
        Device: VA1$:[SITEDIR]PRE_RA5P158_RA_REASON_752_BKUP_20190606.GBL
        Parameters? "WNS" =>
        Use a "V" format to avoid problems with control characters.
  
        Global ^RA(75.2 -- NOTE: translation in effect
  
     Verify that the file was created and exists in the directory
     specified.
  
  
 ===================  Installation Instructions ====================

 Backout/Roll-back strategy
 ==========================
 Follow the pre-installation instructions.
  
 During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as
 directed, "Backup a Transport Global", then routines will have the ability
 to be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was generated.
  
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of the
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel. A
 national help desk ticket should be logged before attempting any backout
 procedure. A national help desk ticket should be logged before attempting
 any backout procedure and the 'Released by' person on the patch should be 
 notified.
