Subject: HL7 VAQ RELEASE STUDY & HLO QUERY CLEAN-UP

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
  
 1) National Teleradiology Program (NTP) 'Release' study (VAQ) HL7 message
 2) HLO Query Logic Cleanup
 3) Erroneous reports with 'Add Exam to Last Visit' option
 4) Inactive DX codes from Voice Recognition, NTP, and/or other reporting 
    interface.
 5) Redundant call to GENERATE^HLMA
 6) Registered request printer location and exam information display
 7) <SUBSCRIPT>STUFF+1^RASTREQ1 - Strip site prefix if SSANs are disabled

 Problem A:
 ----------
 When NTP releases a study back to the facility for local dication, they
 send a 'VAQ' message to VistA Radiology. The radiology package will update
 the report to a deleted status if it has no images attached, or the report
 status will be NULL if there are images attached. The report's activity
 log is also updated with a QUIT action.   However, radiology does not pass
 the information on to the Picture Archiving and Communication System
 (PACS) so PACS is not aware that the study was released and now needs to
 be read by a local radiologist. This potentially causes delays in patient
 care as the released study may be overlooked.  Manual steps are needed to
 resend the study to PACS or update it so that it will be picked up by
 local staff to read/dictate.
  
 Resolution A:
 -------------
 When VistA Radiology receives a 'VAQ' release study message from NTP, it 
 will process it and then broadcast the 'VAQ' message out to subscribers 
 of the new radiology event driver protocol RA RELEASE 2.4.  The ORU 
 message will contain a 'VAQ' in the OBR 25 - Result Status field and the 
 OBX 11 - Observation Result Status fields. The message will not be 
 returned to the sender if they are a subscriber of the RA RELEASE 2.4 
 event driver. 
  
 Problem B:
 ----------
 Previous NTP vendor (ScImage) used HLO queries to retrieve historical 
 radiology reports.  The current vendor uses the radiology option 'Resend
 Radiology HL7 Messages By Date Range' [RA HL7 RESEND BY DATE RANGE]. The
 HLO query logic is no longer in use and will be removed from all VistA
 systems.  This includes five routines and four HLO Application Registries.
  
 Resolution B:
 -------------
 This patch will DELETE the following routines:
  
  RAHL23Q
  RAHL23Q1
  RAHL23QU
  RAHL24Q
  RAHL24U
  
 This patch will DELETE the following HLO Application Registries:
  
  RA-NTP-QRY-CLIENT
  RA-NTP-QRY-SERVER
  RA-NTP-QUERY
  RA-NTP-RSP
  
 Problem C:
 ----------
 R18449004FY18
 R17033449FY18
 Using the 'Add Exam to Last Visit' [RA ADDEXAM] option in Radiology to add
 a descendant printset exam will intermittently result in an erroneous 
 report being attached to the added exam(s). 
  
 Resolution C:
 -------------
 Variable RA17 is set in routine RAREG and used in RAREG2 to set the 
 report pointer  on the printset studies.  PS1 will set RA17 again in
 RAREG1 just before calling SET17^RAREG2 to set the 'REPORT TEXT' [#17]
 field on the descendant exam.  A check is also performed in RAREG and
 RAREG1 to see if the RA17 variable is not correct, and if so the
 application will log it.
  
 Problem D:
 ----------
 I18877890FY18
 Inactive Radiology Diagnostic Codes (Dx Code) from the DIAGNOSTIC CODES 
 file [#78.3] are selectable with Voice Recognition (VR) HL7 interface with
 VistA Radiology package. A VistA Radiology patch is needed to
 monitor/check the status of the Dx Code and prevent an inactive Dx Code
 from being sent from VR software via HL7 interface to VistA Radiology. The
 patch will need to send information back to VR why the message was not
 transmitted and necessary follow-up actions to communicate the correct
 Radiologic Dx Code. The use of inactive DX Codes has been reported as a 
 patient safety issue (PSPO 3637); a National Patient Safety Alert is
 pending. 
  
 Resolution D:
 -------------
 Modify DIAG^RAHLO2 to reject the HL7 report (ORU) message if the 
 diagnostic code passed has the inactive flag set.  A negative
 acknowledgement (NAK) will be returned to the sending application
 indicating the reason for the rejection. If the site has a mail group 
 populated on the sending application parameter, a mail bulletin will be
 generated to that mail group.  An exception will be logged in file HL7
 MESSAGE EXCEPTIONS [#79.3]. RAHLO has also been modified to clean up some
 variables.
  
 Problem E:
 ----------
 A redundant call to GENERATE^HLMA was discovered in RAHLRPT where the
 routine branches off to v2.4 logic.
  
 Resolution E:
 -------------
 Remove superfluous 'EXIT' call in routine RAHLRPT where v2.4 logic 
 branches off.
  
 Problem F:
 ----------
 Radiology exams may be registered to a different location that the one 
 specified on the order and if the registered request printer is defined,
 the request will print to the order's submitted to location instead of the
 registered location. Also, unless a procedure is changed, the exam
 information is not displayed on the printed registered request.
  
 Resolution F:
 -------------
 Routine RAREG3 is modified to look at the registered exam's imaging 
 location's printer instead of the order's (submitted to) location 
 printer. Routines RAORD6 and RAUTL15 are modified to save and print the 
 exam data regardless if the procedure changed or which option is used.
  
 Problem G:
 ----------
 If radiology receives a report HL7 message with a site prefix on the 
 accession number, but site specific accession numbers (SSAN) are
 not enabled, radiology will error with <SUBSCRIPT>STUFF+1^RASTREQ1 and the
 exam will not complete.
  
 Resolution G:
 -------------
 Modify routine RAHLTCPX to strip off the site prefix if SSANs are not 
 enabled. 
  
  
 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 ========================
 These are the documentation changes associated with this patch:
  
 HL7 Setup/Implementation Manual
 HL7 Interface Specification
 HL7 Interface Specifications for Voice Recognition Dictation Systems 
  
  
 These manuals are available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of
 the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices. These files
 should be retrieved in binary format.
  
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
 (1) The preferred method is to SFTP the files from
     download.vista.domain.ext, which will transmit the files from the
     first available FTP server.
  
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
     specific server as follows:
  
     Hines                 ftp.domain.ext
     Salt Lake City        ftp.domain.ext
  
 The documentation distribution includes:
  
 File Name             Description                           Protocol
 ---------             -----------                           --------

 Backout/Roll-back Strategy:
 ===========================
  
  Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
  development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision
  to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between
  development team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA
  personnel. A national help desk ticket should be logged before attempting
  any backout procedures.
  
  Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
  saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
  Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
  install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded
  with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The
  Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the
  backed up routines onto the VistA System.
