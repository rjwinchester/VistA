Subject: RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL USAGE REPORT IS NOT DISPLAYING CORRECT VALUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Radiopharmaceutical Usage Report is not displaying correct 
 Long-Case@Time values after turning on Site Specific Accession Numbers
  
 ServiceNow Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1.  Defect 833192 (ServiceNow INC1967867)
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Running the Radiopharmaceutical Usage Report after the site turned on the Site
 Specific Accession Numbers functionality (introduced with RA*5.0*47), the
 report shows the Long-Case value as the same for all lines of the report.  It
 is displaying the @time correct but the Long-Case value is instead the value
 for the last entry in NUC MED EXAM DATA reviewed when processing the report.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modify routine RANMUSE2 to reset variables RADFN, RADTI & RACNI before calling
 SSANVAL^RAHLRU1 which uses these values to find the Site Specific Accession
 Number. 
  
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 Boston HCS
 Lexington VAMC
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system. Installation should 
 take less than 2 minutes to complete.
  
 Installation Instructions:

              a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
                 message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
                 backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
              b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
                 (allow you to view all changes that will be made when this

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 -------------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
