 Problem A:
 ----------
 It was discovered that one can sign on to one location and register an 
 order from a different modality.  Radiology prompts the application end 
 user [AEU] to switch to the correct location, but the AEU can simply plug 
 in the same location as before and continue.  At the procedure prompt, 
 they are again stopped because the imaging type of the procedure and 
 location do not match.  The AEU can then change the procedure to one with 
 a different imaging type.
  
 Resolution A:
 -------------
 The routine RAREG3 is modified to check the AEUs sign-on location after 
 they switch.  They cannot proceed with the registration unless they are 
 signed on to the correct location. 
  
 Problem B:
 ----------
 An undefined error on array node HL("SAN") was reported while processing 
 radiology result messages:
  
 $ZE= <UNDEFINED>EM+9^RAHLACK *HL("SAN")
 Last Global Ref: ^%ZOSF("OS")
 S RAMPG=$P($$GETAPP^HLCS2(HL("SAN")),U,1) ;RAMPG="G.RAD HL7 MESSAGES"
  
 Additionally it was discovered that HL7 was doing a lookup that didn't
 account for multiple entries and resulted in this error: "Invalid 
 Receiving Application for this Event"
  
 RESOLUTION B:
 -------------
 Modify RAHLACK to data check variable HL("SAN") before using it. 
  
 The second part of this problem is on the HL7 side and will be 
 addressed by HL7 patch HL*1.6*171.
  
 PROBLEM C:
 ----------
 When using the Procedure Enter/Edit [RA PROCEDURE] an inactive CPT code
 can be entered on a detailed or series procedure.
  
 RESOLUTION C:
 -------------
 Update the CPT field [#9] in the NEW RAD PROCEDURE WORKUP file [#71.11]
 with an input transform to screen the inactive CPT codes.
  
 PROBLEM D:
 ----------
 The new style cross "AS" cross reference on the Exam Status field 
 [70.03;3] isn't updating with nuclear medicine studies that have
 radio-pharmaceuticals entered through the Exam Status Tracking option.   
 Specifically the practice of entering a new "LOT NO" causes some variable
 corruption within Fileman and the "AS" cross reference does not get
 updated with the status change. Additionally, the exam's activity log does
 not accurately reflect the option used to update the exam.
  
 RESOLUTION D:
 -------------
 The Exam Status Tracking input template 'RA STATUS CHANGE' is modified so 
 the exam status field [70.03;3] is updated outside of the input template
 with FILE^DIE to set the field. RADD3 is modified to update the activity
 log with the correct option code for 'Exam Status Tracking' which is 'S'

    ===================  Installation Instructions ====================
   If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the
   Radiology users be off the system. **Voice Recognition activity 
   should be stopped.**  Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
   Install Time - less than 2 minutes
  
   1. Load Transport Global:
      ----------------------
    Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the
    INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
   2. Start Up KIDS:
      --------------

       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
  
   4. Select Installation Option: Install Package(s):
      -----------------------------------------------
       **This is the step to start the installation of this KIDS patch:
    a. Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch install.
  
    b. Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO//
       ,answer YES unless your site rebuilds menu trees nightly.
  
    c. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES//', answer NO.
  
    d. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Options, and Protocols? YES//', answer YES.
  
       When prompted, 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of order':',
       enter the following options:
  
       Disable the following VistA RIS options:
       ----------------------------------------
       Register Patient for Exams      [RA REG]
       Status Tracking of Exams        [RA STATRACK]
  
  
       When prompted, 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of
       order':',press <ENTER>.
  
 Backout/Roll-back Strategy:
 ===========================
  
  Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
  development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision
  to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between
  development team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA
  personnel. A national help desk ticket should be logged before attempting
  any backout procedures.
  
  Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
  saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
  Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
  install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded
  with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The
  Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the
  backed up routines onto the VistA System.
