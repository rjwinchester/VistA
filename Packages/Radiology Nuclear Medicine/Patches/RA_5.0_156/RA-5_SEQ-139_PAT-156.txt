Subject: CPRS/RIS: OUT OF SYNCH ORDERS & ERROR IN IA 2265 CODE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Input Template

Description:
============

 RA*5.0*156 was created to address the following issues:
  
 Issue one: INC2553950
 ---------------------
 RA*5.0*124 corrected an issue where the Radiology/Nuclear Medicine 
 ('RIS') side was out of sequence with CPRS when a procedure was edited on 
 a completed study. The issue was that the RIS showed the study and 
 request as being complete while the CPRS order showed active. Since that 
 time it was discovered, through a workflow anomaly, that editing two 
 other RAD/NUC MED PATIENT [#70] fields backed the CPRS order down to 
 active. The action of add/edit/deleting the 'Procedure Modifier' [#125],
 would leave the RIS study and request as complete but the CPRS order as
 active. Additional testing found that editing the 'Requesting Physician'
 [#14] on a completed study will also change the CPRS order status to
 active.
  
 Resolution (1)
 --------------
 RA*5.0*156 will prevent add/edit/delete actions on the 'Procedure
 Modifier' [#125] field when case editing a completed study. This patch
 will prevent the editing the 'Requesting Physician' [#14] field when case
 editing a completed study.
  
  
 Issue two: INC4590879
 ---------------------
 The error is 'Undefined error <UNDEFINED>SS+3^RAO7PC1 *RADTI' and occurs 
 calling the EN3^RAO7PC1. This entry point is covered by DBIA: 2265. The 
 purpose of the API is to return narrative text for one or more exams.
  
 Resolution (2)
 --------------
 The software prior to RA*5.0*156 references two variables to indicate the 
 inverse date/time of an exam: RAINVXDT & RADTI. The issue occurs when the 
 software defines RAINVXDT but later in the software returns to RADTI. 
 Since RADTI is not defined the result is an error. The fix is to be 
 consistent and reference one variable: RAINVXDT.
  
 Issue three: INC4101382
 -----------------------
 Patch RA*5.0*137 added the ability to broadcast ADT HL7 messages with the
 'Send ADT HL7 message to PACS' [RA ADT] option. The routine RAHLRS is used
 to re-broadcast VistA RIS HL7 messages. RAHLRS checks for the record with
 an IEN of one in the IMAGING SITE PARAMETERS [#2006.1] file. The field IHE
 PACS HL7 INTERFACE ACTIVE [#3.01] indicates if ADT HL7 messages should be
 broadcast (yes/no). The software assumes that a record with an IEN of one
 will always exist. That IEN is not guaranteed to exist. The failure
 occurred at the North Florida HCS.
  
 Resolution (3)
 --------------
 The check for IEN one has been replaced with a check for the institution 
 associated with the hospital production system. If the institution of the 
 hospital production system is not defined as a record in the IMAGING SITE 
 PARAMETERS file the option gracefully exits with a warning message to the
 user.

   affected.
  
   Install Time - less than two minutes
  
   1. Load Transport Global:
      ----------------------
    Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the
    INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
   2. Access the KIDS main menu:
      --------------------------
    Start with the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu [XPD
    MAIN]:
  
            Edits and Distribution ...
            Utilities ...
            Installation ...
  
   Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: INStallation
  
            Load a Distribution
            Print Transport Global
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Install Package(s)
            Restart Install of Package(s)
            Unload a Distribution
            Backup a Transport Global
  
   Select Installation Option:
  
   3. Select Installation Option:
      ---------------------------
       NOTE: The following are OPTIONAL - (When prompted for the INSTALL
             NAME, enter RA*5.0*156):
  
       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed. It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
  
   4. Select Installation Option: Install Package(s):
      -----------------------------------------------
       **This is the step to start the installation of this KIDS patch:
    a. Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch install.
  
    b. Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? NO//
  
    c. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES//', answer NO.
  
    d. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu

       When prompted, 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of order':',
       enter the following options:
        'Add Exams to Last Visit' [RA ADDEXAM]
        'Register Patient for Exams' [RA REG]
        'Case No. Exam Edit' [RA EDITCN]
        'Edit Exam by Patient' [RA EDITPT]
        'Send ADT HL7 message to PACS' [RA ADT] 
  
 Backout/Roll-back strategy
 ==========================
 During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as
 directed, "Backup a Transport Global", then routines will have the ability
 to be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was generated.
  
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of the
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel. A
 national help desk ticket should be logged before attempting any backout
 procedure.
