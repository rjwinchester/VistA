Subject: TRACK MULTIPLE HOLD REASONS FOR A REQUEST

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Input Template

Description:
============

 RA*5.0*133 addresses the new VHA Outpatient Radiology Scheduling Policy 
 which states that Radiology will make two documented attempts to contact 
 the patient. 
  
 There is currently no method in the radiology package to track 
 personnel's attempt to contact a Veteran for scheduling. The order can 
 be scheduled or held, but once in a HOLD status, the HOLD reason cannot 
 be updated.

 Overview:
 =========
 Problem A:
 ----------
 A radiology request can be placed in a HOLD status while the service 
 attempts to schedule the procedure, but only one HOLD reason can be 
 associated with a request. If multiple attempts are made to contact the 
 Veteran, there is no method to track them.
  
 Resolution A:
 -------------
 Create a new menu option Update a Hold Request [RA ORDERREASON UPDATE] 
 which will update the hold reason for a request that is already in a HOLD
 status. When a new hold reason is entered, it will be tracked in the
 REQUEST STATUS TIMES (#75.12) field of the RAD/NUC MED REQUEST 
 (#75.2) file and also the ORDER ACTIONS (#100.008) field multiple of the
 ORDER (#100) file. The new menu option Update a Hold Request 
 [RA ORDERREASON UPDATE] option will be placed on the Radiology/Nuclear
 Med Order Entry Menu [RA ORDER].
  
 Problem B:
 ----------
 Hold/Cancel Reasons are locally maintained and therefore it is difficult 
 to track national data statistics. The Radiology Program Office and 
 Radiology Informatics Committee approved the use of ten new nationally 
 standardized HOLD reasons for the radiology scheduling directive. These 
 new standardized entries will not be editable at the local site level.
  
 Resolution B:
 -------------
 A post-init routine "RAI13PO" will load ten new standardized HOLD
 reasons to the RAD/NUC MED REASON (#75.2) file. These reasons have the
 "Nature of Order Activity" set to POLICY. This is used by Computerized
 Patient Record System (CPRS) to determine if the action is logged in the
 ORDER ACTIONS multiple. A new flag will be added to the RAD/NUC MED REASON
 (#75.2) file. The ten new HOLD reasons will have the NATIONAL flag set to
 "YES" preventing local modifications. The Reason Edit [RA REASON EDIT]
 option will also be modified to skip editing of the REASON (.01) field to
 protect historical data from local modifications to this field.
  
 1.  CALLED VETERAN FOR APPT
 2.  MYHEALTHYVET CONTACT
 3.  LETTER SENT TO CALL VA
 4.  RESCHED CALL BY VETERAN
 5.  MRI SAFETY REVIEW
 6.  RADIOLOGIST REVIEW
 7.  COMMUNITY CARE APPT
 8.  WAITING ON OUTSIDE IMAGES
 9.  FUTURE APPOINTMENT
 10. NON RADIOLOGY CONSULT
  
 *** NOTE *** 
 The Reason Edit [RA REASON EDIT] option has been modified from an edit
 option to a run routine type. KIDS does not clean up fields used by the
 edit, but the stray fields do not cause any ill effect on the
 functionality of the option.
  
 Problem C:
 ----------
 If a request has been updated with a new hold reason, the activity will 
 only be logged if the TRACK REQUEST STATUS CHANGES (#.119) field in the 
 Rad/Nuc Med Division (#79) file is set to YES. If Exam Status Tracking is
 not enabled, exam status activities are not logged.
  
 Resolution C:
 -------------
 The Division Parameter Set-up [RA SYSDIV] option input template will be   
 modified to stuff a YES in the TRACK REQUEST STATUS CHANGES (#.119) 
 field and TRACK EXAM STATUS CHANGES (.11) field. These prompts will no 
 longer be visible to the user for input. A post-init routine RAI133PO
 will loop through the RAD/NUC MED DIVISION (#79) file to check/update
 existing divisions.
  
 Problem D:
 ----------
 The Pending/Hold Rad/Nuc Med Request Log no longer displays the data 
 needed for current business needs or in a format that can be easily 
 manipulated into other formats such as Excel.
  
 Resolution D:
 -------------
 The Pending/Hold Rad/Nuc Med Request Log  [RA ORDERPENDING] option will be
 modified to display the hold reason for held requests and the requesting 
 provider for pending requests. The ordering location is no longer 
 displayed. The Date Desired will be moved to the data display line
 instead of sorting the requests under each Date Desired header.

 Reason Edit   [RA REASON EDIT]

 Update a Hold Request   [RA ORDERREASON UPDATE]

 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 ========================
 These are the documentation changes associated with this patch:
 RA Nuclear Medicine User Manual       
 RA Nuclear Medicine Tech Manual  
 RA Nuclear Medicine ADPAC Guide
   
 These manuals are available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of 
 the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices. These files 
 should be retrieved in binary format.
     
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
    
 (1) The preferred method is to SFTP the files from 
     download.vista.domain.ext, which will transmit the files from the
     first available FTP server.
     
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
     specific server as follows:
     
     Albany                ftp.domain.ext
     Hines                 ftp.domain.ext
     Salt Lake City        ftp.domain.ext
     
 The documentation distribution includes:
