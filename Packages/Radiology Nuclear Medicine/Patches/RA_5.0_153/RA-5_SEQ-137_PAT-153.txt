Subject: REMOVING SCALED wRVU FUNCTIONALITY, ADDRESS ADD EXAM TO LAST VISIT W/PSETS

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 RA*5.0*153 was created to address the following issues:
  
 1) INC4112622
    ----------
    Issue: The routine RAPXRM did not return imaging location or radiology
    division information for a specified radiology study.
    
    Resolution: RAPXRM has been updated to include imaging location and 
    the radiology division.
  
 2) INC4113299
    ----------
    Issue: Scaled work Relative Value Units (wRVUs) are not relevant as a
    metric by Radiology Program Office.
  
    Resolution: The option: 'Procedure Scaled wRVU/CPT Report'
    [RA PROC CPTSWRVU] will be removed from the 'Special Reports'
    [RA SPECRPTS] menu.
    
    The options 'Physician scaled wRVU Report by Imaging Type' [RA
    WKLIPHY SWRVU ITYPE] & 'Physician scaled wRVU Report by CPT'
    [RA WKLIPHY SWRVU CPT] will be removed from the 'Personnel
    Workload Reports' [RA WKL] menu.
  
    Note: The options removed were exported under the RA WKL and
    RA SPECRPTS menus. If those options to be removed reside on
    different menus then those new menus should be identified   
    and checked after the installation of RA*5.0*153. 
  
 3) INC0565395
    ----------
    Issue: Two radiology studies with the same CPT (KNEE 2 VIEWS LEFT & 
    KNEE 2 VIEWS RIGHT) are registered for the same patient at the same
    date/time. When those studies are both completed Patient Care 
    Encounter (PCE) has incorrect and missing data attributed to this 
    encounter.
    
    Resolution: This patch will uniquely identify each study in the 
    encounter such that PCE will be able to identify each study and 
    correctly file those radiology study records within PCE.
  
 4) INC3469724
    ----------
    Issue: Existing non-completed descendent exams, which are part of
    a printset, have additional exams added to that visit. If those 
    initial exams have report associations, the newly added exams may be
    associated with an incorrect report.
  
    Resolution: This patch will file the report pointer on that new exam 
    or exams by modifying the routine RAREG2 to correct this data filing issue.

 Backout/Roll-back strategy
 ==========================
 During installation, if the option to back up routines was run as
 directed, "Backup a Transport Global", then routines will have the ability
 to be restored from the "backup" MailMan message that was generated.
  
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of the
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel. A
 national help desk ticket should be logged before attempting any backout
 procedure.
