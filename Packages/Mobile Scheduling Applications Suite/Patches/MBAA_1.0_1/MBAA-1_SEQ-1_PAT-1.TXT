Subject: MOBILESCHEDULING APPLICATIONS SUITE (MBAA)

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 The new Mobile Scheduling Application Suite (MBAA) package will enable 
 the exchange of data between VistA and VA mobile scheduling applications 
 via the use of Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs).  These MBAA RPCs allow 
 authorized users of the VA mobile application(s) to retrieve and write 
 scheduling data to the VistA Scheduling package files. Currently there 
 are two mobile applications that have been developed.  Veteran 
 Appointment Request (VAR) is a veteran facing application that provides 
 Veterans with information from VistA to schedule Primary Care clinic 
 appointments, view future booked appointments, and cancel future 
 appointments that were made using the Mobile App.  Additionally, using 
 VAR, Veterans can enter an appointment request for a Primary Care or 
 Mental Health appointment and that request will then be processed in the 
 VA Scheduling Staff facing application, Scheduling Manager (SM).  
 SM is a web-based scheduling application that allows scheduling
 staff to view and process Veteran appointment requests placed by Veterans 
 in the VAR mobile application.
  
 This patch release includes only the RPCs, routines, and an option for 
 the VistA system. MBAA has created a new option, MBAA SCHEDULING CALENDAR 
 VIEW. All the new MBAA RPCs are registered to this new option. The option 
 should be assigned to users of the SM mobile application.
  
 In the VAR application, Veteran users are logged-in using an application 
 proxy, Department of Defense User. All sites will need to ensure this 
 user entry has been established in the New Person file #200.  
  
 This patch is being released prior to the deployment of 
 the supported web applications Veteran Appointment Request (VAR) and 
 Scheduling Manager (SM). The web applications will be implemented using 
 a phased release schedule. Each site will be contacted by a member of 
 the VAR/SM Release Team or a designated POC from the VISN to coordinate 
 the deployment of the web applications and a VAR/SM Implementation will 
 assist with the training of staff as well as outreach and communications 
 to the veterans. The installation of the VistA MBAA patch will ensure 
 that each site is prepared for the implementation once the web 
 applications release reaches each VAMC site. For any questions about the 
 phased release, please contact the Release and Implementation Team at 
 VAR_Release_Team@domain.ext.
  
 Refer to the MBAA*1*1 PREINSTALL GUIDE for pre-installation and 
 configuration instructions.  These steps MUST be completed prior to
