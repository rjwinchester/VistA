 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. I10657865FY16- Appointments that were Direct Patient Scheduled are not
                   being Displayed in VS GUI Except in the Pending Appointment
                   Box.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When selecting an appointment from the Pending Appointment Block in VS GUI
   for an appointment that was directly scheduled by the veteran via the VAR
   application, a message is received that reads 'the appointment cannot be
   displayed because it was created prior to the VistA Scheduling installation.
   The Clinic Schedule for the selected appointment cannot be displayed'.  The
   appointment was made after the install and the only difference is it was
   made via Direct Patient Scheduling (DPS) Using the VAR application. These
   appointments must be displayed and available to take action using VS GUI.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The supporting routine for the MBAA APPOINTMENT MAKE remote procedure has
   been enhanced to update the appropriate VS GUI files when an appointment has
   been added using the VAR application. This includes the SDEC APPOINTMENT
   file (#409.84) and the SDEC APPT REQUEST file (409.85).
   
 2. I11760785FY17- Appointments that have been cancelled by a Veteran from the
                   Veteran Appointment Request (VAR) application are not being
                   removed from the VS GUI Calendar display.
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When a Veteran cancels an appointment using the VAR application that was
   made by the local site, the appointment status changes to cancelled and is
   removed from the scheduling grid in VistA but the appointment continues to
   display in the VS GUI calendar. The appointment shows correctly in the VS
   GUI pending appointment block cancelled, but does not show as cancelled in
   the Calendar.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   The supporting routine for the MBAA CANCEL APPOINTMENT remote procedure has
   been enhanced to update the appropriate VS GUI files when an appointment is
   cancelled using the VAR application. This includes the SDEC APPOINTMENT file
   (#409.84) and the SDEC APPT REQUEST file (409.85).
