Subject: MOBILE SCHEDULING ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch release includes bug fixes for issues with the remote procedure
 calls used by the Mobile Device Web Service (MDWS) interface to retrieve
 scheduling data for Veteran Appointment Request (VAR) and Scheduling
 Manager (SM) web applications:
  
 1) Overlapping appointments were allowed as long as they did not start at 
    the same time.  This issue is corrected by this patch.
  
 2) The Wait Time and Follow-up Visit fields are not being calculated for
    VAR appointment as seen on the Expanded Entry option (screen 3 of 6) of
    Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT]. This issue is corrected by this
    patch.
