Subject: MOBILE SCHEDULING APPLICATION FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch release includes bug fixes for issues with the remote procedure
 calls used by the Mobile Device Web Service (MDWS) interface to retrieve
 scheduling data for Veteran Appointment Request (VAR) and Scheduling
 Manager (SM) web applications:
   
 1. Available appointment slots for clinics with appointment lengths of 10
 minutes or 20 minutes were being retrieved incorrectly. This issue is
 corrected by this patch.
   
 2. Cancellation of appointments for clinics with 10 minutes or 20 minute
 appointment lengths were releasing the wrong slots in VistA. This issue
 is corrected by this patch.
  
 3. Cancellation of variable length appointments using multiple slots was
 Only releasing the first appointment slot in VistA. This issue is 
 Corrected by this patch.
  
 4. Make appointments allowed a new appointment to be made when the patient
 already had an appointment for the same time at another clinic. This is 
 corrected by this release to now return an APTPAHA error if an appointment
 for this patient at the same time exists at any clinic.
  
 5. Cancellation of appointments was incorrectly allowed on some
 appointments including those with checkout date and clinics which
 required privileged user access.
