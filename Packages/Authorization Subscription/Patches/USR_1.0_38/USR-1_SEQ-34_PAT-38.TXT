 SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION DISTRIBUTION:
 ======================================== 
 Sites may retrieve the new documentation directly via FTP. The preferred 
 method is to FTP the files from:
  
        download.vista.domain.ext
   
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  
     
 Sites may also elect to retrieve the documentation directly from the
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory from a specific server as follows:
    
 Albany:             ftp.domain.ext
 Hines:              ftp.domain.ext
 Salt Lake City:     ftp.domain.ext
