Subject: HMP USR TRIGGER FOR ASU RULES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains an update to the Authorized Subscription Utilities
 (ASU) package to support the Enterprise Health Management Platform (eHMP).
  
 This patch modifies two existing routines, USRCLASS and USRRULA. These 
 routines are invoked when ASU rules are changed and ensures that when 
 invoked an update is sent to eHMP. MUMPS error occur unless installation
 of the pre-requisite bundle is followed immediately by the installation
 of HMP 2.0.
  
 ****NOTE****
 This patch is part of a pre-requisite, multi-build host file which 
 contains all the patches needed prior to installation of the HMP 2.0 
 package.  This patch name is HMP PREREQUISITE BUNDLE 2.0.  The 
 multi-build contains the following patches:
