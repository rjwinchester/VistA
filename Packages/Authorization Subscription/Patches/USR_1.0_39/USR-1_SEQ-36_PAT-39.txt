Subject: VISTA SECURITY REMEDIATION UPDATES FOR FOUR SLASHES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch USR*1.0*39 is being released to support the security vulnerability
 solution for the VistA Security Remediation (VSR) program that focuses on 
 updates to the four-slash logic (////) with three-slash logic (///).
  
 Defect:
 995649 - DEF - Four Slash (////) logic to USRMEMBR routine
    
 Included in this patch is the following update:
 Modifications were made to the routine that supports the User 
 Class Definition [USR CLASS DEFINITION] option under the User Class
 Management [USR CLASS MANAGEMENT MENU] option.
  
 When a user performs the Schedule Changes under a class definition by 
 entering the CLASS, EFFECTIVE DATE/TIME and EXPIRATION DATE/TIME, the
 data was being 'stuffed' in the data fields without validation. This patch
 will modify routine USRMEMBR to change the four-slash coding (////) to 
 three-slash coding (///) to ensure data is validated before storing.
