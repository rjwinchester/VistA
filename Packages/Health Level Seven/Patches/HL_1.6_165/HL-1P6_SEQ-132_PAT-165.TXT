 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1) I8007321FY16  issue with HL7 processes for Cleveland
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Port scanners revealed issues in the HL7 receiving process when
 messages are in a specific format which can cause the receiver to 
 result in an endless loop.
    
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modify the HL7 receiving process to handle any message format without
 resulting in an endless loop.
  
 Routine: HLCSTCP1
  
  
 ================ INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 Installation should take less than 10 minutes.
 Note: only experienced installers should attempt the install.
  
   1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation - but
       it is highly recommended to install the patch during off-hours.
  
   2.  Disable the HL7 TCPIP services for the multi-listeners running on 
       all nodes in the cluster, for example, at the VMS prompt:
  
       ISC6A1> TCPIP
       TCPIP> DISABLE SERVICE BAY_HLSP
       Note: BAY is the 3 letter site designation for Bay Pines.
  
       ****For Linux***
  
       Disable the Linux xinetd HL7 service from the Linux OS prompt:
       # rdp_ip_service bay hls disable
       Note: BAY is the 3 letter site designation for Bay Pines.
         
   3.  Shutdown all Logical Links, incoming and outgoing filers using
       the Filer and Link Management options listed below:
  
       Stop All Messaging Background Processes [HL STOP ALL]
  
   4a. Shutdown the Link Manager using the Filer and Link Management
       option listed below:
  
       TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
  
   4b. Wait until all Single Threaded Listeners  (Device Type = SS) are 
       in SHUTDOWN state as seen in the Systems Link Monitor OR 10 
       minutes have passed - whichever comes first.
  
   5.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   6.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your system.
       The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  On
       the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global 
          Compare Transport Global to Current System 
          Backup a Transport Global
          Install Package(s) 
  
       When using the Install Package(s) menu option to install the 
       patch build, you will be asked several questions.  The questions,
       and the answers you should supply, are shown below.
  
       INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*165>
   
       Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install? NO// <NO>
       Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
       and Protocols? NO// <NO>
  
   7.  Start up all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers using
       the Filer and Link Management Option's 'Restart/Start All Links
       and Filers [HL TASK RESTART]' menu option.
       (Note those links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need
       to be restarted manually.)
   
   8.  Restart the Link Manager, that was shutdown in step 4, using the
       Filer and Link Management option listed below:
  
       TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
  
   9.  Enable the HL7 TCPIP services for the multi-listeners, for example, 
       at the VMS prompt:
  
       ISC6A1> TCPIP
       TCPIP> ENABLE SERVICE BAY_HLSP
       Note: BAY is the 3 letter site designation for Bay Pines.
  
       ****For Linux***
  
       Enable the Linux xinetd HL7 service from the Linux OS prompt:
       # rdp_ip_service bay hls enable
       Note: BAY is the 3 letter site designation for Bay Pines.
