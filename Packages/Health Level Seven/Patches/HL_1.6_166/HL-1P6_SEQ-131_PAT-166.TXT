Subject: EDIT LOGICAL LINK ERROR;<STORE> ERROR;ROUTER PROTOCOL FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses issues when editing HL LOGICAL LINKS, <STORE> errors
 caused by excessive out queue arrays and potential issues with router
 protocols where additional, unwanted data is processed.

 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1) I9871701FY16 HL7 - Logical Links: 
  
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 If the value entered for the DNS DOMAIN field (#.08) in the HL LOGICAL 
 LINK file (#870) does not meet the requirements defined in the first 
 condition of the INPUT TRANSFORM (less than 70 characters but more than 
 4) the value (X) is deleted and in the next command tries to call a 
 function and pass in X (which no longer exists), producing an <UNDEFINED> 
 error.
    
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Prior to executing the second function, the INPUT TRANSFORM will be
 modified to verify the passed value (X) exists.  If it does not,
 it will not proceed in filing the data. 
  
  
 Data Dictionary:
 ----------------
  
 Before:
  
 870,.08       DNS DOMAIN             0;8 FREE TEXT
  
               INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>70!($L(X)<4) X S HLIP=$$ADDRESS^XLFNSLK
                                 (X) K:('HLIP)&($P($G(^HLCS(869.3,1,0)),"^",3)="
                                 P")&($P($$SITE^VASITE,"^",3)) X I HLIP S HLIP=$
                                 $IP^HLMA3(DA,HLIP) 
  
 After:
  
 870,.08       DNS DOMAIN             0;8 FREE TEXT
  
               INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>70!($L(X)<4) X I $D(X) S HLIP=$$ADDRESS
                                 ^XLFNSLK(X) K:('HLIP)&($P($G(^HLCS(869.3,1,0)),
                                 "^",3)="P")&($P($$SITE^VASITE,"^",3)) X I HLIP 
                                 S HLIP=$$IP^HLMA3(DA,HLIP)
  
  
 2) I6653157FY16 HLO creating error: STORE>OUT+9^HLOQUE 
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 It appears there is a process in VPS that creates a new "OUTQUEUE" with each
 process, which has led to an extremely large number of queues.  As a
 result, the process of counting the queues results in a store error
 because it stores the number in an array which is limited in space.
   
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The count process will no longer store each queue in an array due to the size
 constraints thereby circumventing any possibility of a <STORE> error.

 below)
  
 Routine: HLOQUE
  
 3) I7437950FY16 Router protocol being present with MSH segment from previous 
    message
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 While trying to provide the router protocol the message contents from the 
 HL7 MESSAGE TEXT file (#772), there is a potential to also provide the
 message header ("MSH") from the HL7 MESSAGE ADMINISTRATION file (#773)
 from a subscriber protocol, previously processed which could cause
 problems during message validation.
    
 Resolution:
 ----------
 When setting up the utility that presents the message contents to the router
 protocol, variables will be set to notify the utility that the HL7 MESSAGE
 ADMINISTRATION file (#773) message header should not be processed.
  
 Routine: HLCS 
  
  
 Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 =====================================
 The VMS HLO Developer Manual was updated with issue 2 above.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the documentation directly using Secure File Transfer 
 Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following OI
