Subject: HL7 ISSUE DISCOVERED WITH INTERNAL TO INTERNAL MESSAGING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch will address 1 issue:
  
  1. When several HL7 event driver protocols share the same sending
     application, message type, event type, and version ID, the HL7 software
     will only retrieve the first protocol, even if it is not the correct
     protocol for the current message being processed.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
  
 1. INC2613742 - HL7 issue discovered with internal to internal messaging
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The HL7 software currently reads from the "AHL1" or "AHL21" 
 cross-reference in the PROTOCOL (#101) file to get the event driver 
 protocol for the current message being processed. The cross-references
 are sorted by sending application, message type, event type, and
 version ID. If several protocols share the same sending application,
 message type, event type, and version ID, the software will only read
 the first entry in the cross-reference. The first entry is not
 necessarily the correct protocol for the current message, and this can
 lead to the incorrect protocol being returned.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine HLTPCK1A will be updated to no longer use the "AHL1" or
 "AHL21" cross-references, and instead use the message ID from the 
 message header to retrieve the correct protocol for the current message.

 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 minutes
 to install.
  
 This patch does not require any menu options to be disabled during
 patch installation.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
  
 1.  If the release is provided using PackMan, choose the PackMan message
     containing this build. Then select the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan
     option to load the build.
  
     If this release is provided using a Host file, use the Load a
     Distribution option contained on the Kernel Installation and
     Distribution System Menu to load the Host file.
  
  
  2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
     Installation Menu.  From this menu, 
  
     A. Select the Verify Checksums in Transport Global option to confirm 
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global. When 
        prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch or build name (ex.  
        HL*1.6*171).
  
        NOTE: Using <spacebar><enter> will not bring up a Multi-Package
              build even if it was loaded immediately before this step.
              It will only bring up the last patch in the build.
  
     B. Select the Backup a Transport Global option to create a backup
        message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not backup
        any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     C. You may also elect to use the following options: 
        i. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
           the components of the KIDS build.
       ii. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
           is installed.  It compares all of the components of this patch,
           such as routines, DDs, templates, etc.
  
     D. Select the Install Package(s) option and choose the patch to install.
 
       i. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
           NO//', answer NO.
   
      ii. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
           and Protocols? NO//', answer NO.

 N/A
  
  
 Back-Out/Roll Back Plan:
 ------------------------
 Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option.  The message containing the 
 backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at 
 the Message Action prompt.  The PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE is 
 then used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA system.
