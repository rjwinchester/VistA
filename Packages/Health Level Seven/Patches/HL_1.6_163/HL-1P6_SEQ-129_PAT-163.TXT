 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1) INC000001024726 HL7 IPV6 CONVERSION 
  
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 In preparation for the VA's transition from Internet Protocol version 
 4 (IPv4) to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), the HL7 package
 will require modifications to make it IPv6 ready.
  
 Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the latest version of the Internet 
 Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification
 and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across 
 the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force 
 (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address 
 exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4.
  
 Vista is only compatible with IPv4 currently and this effort is to prepare
 for IPv6 compatibility.
  
    
 Resolution:
 ----------
 As part of the transition for HL7, modifications were required to include
 evaluation of the current system to determine what version of IP is 
 enabled and format each referenced null or loopback address accordingly.
 Additionally, modifications were made to take into consideration
 differences in formats in regards to the "MSH" segment of HL7 messages
 when parsing messages for certain components.
