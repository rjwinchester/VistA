Subject: UPDATE MPI LISTENER FOR LINUX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch updates the Master Patient Index (MPI) listener to work on
 Linux and Unix systems.
  
 **************************************************************************
 * This patch updates the MPI Direct Connect listener entry point to work *
 * on LINUX.  Even though the routine being modified is nationally        *
 * distributed, it is only active or accessible on the Austin Information *
 * Technology Center (AITC) server housing the Master Patient Index (MPI).*
 * Since this is a nationally distributed routine, this patch will need to*
 * be installed at all VAMC's, however this functionality will be         *
 * transparent to the VAMC's.                                             *

 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
 I16368504FY17 - HL7 real-time connection written for MPI -- needs 
                 updating for Linux 
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 MPI will be migrating to a Linux based system which will require an
 update to the listener triggered code to account for the new operating
 system entry point.
    
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Routine HLCSAS will be modified to add a new entry point defined in XINETD
 to manage incoming connections on Linux and Unix systems.
  
  
 Routine: HLCSAS
  
 Please Note:
 ============
    Routine HLCSAS will display several XINDEX errors when installing
    this patch.  The locking error will be resolved with this patch.
    However, the rest of the errors have SACC exemptions or have been
    approved and it is ok to proceed.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 ***This patch must be installed during non-peak hours***
  
 *Although it is possible to encounter an EDITED error, which would 
 ungracefully stop a specific end-user session via the use of certain
 HL7 processes, the chance of unintentionally doing so is extremely remote.
 Analysis indicates no loss off patient data if an EDITED error did 
 occur.  For this reason, the install instructions do NOT direct the 
 installer to stop any HL7 processes (e.g., HL7 Links and Filers), 
 nor do they direct the installer to stop the HL7 multithreaded listener
 service.  However, installing this patch during non-peak hours is 
 prudent.  It should take less than 2 minutes to install the patch.
   
     1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the
        INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
    
     2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
        the Installation menu.  
    
     3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter HL*1.6*169)
    
          a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
              you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
              transport global.
          b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
              the components of the KIDS build.
          c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
              allow you to view all changes that will be made when this 
              patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
              (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
          d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
              message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
              backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
     4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        HL*1.6*169.
   
     5. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
        NO//", respond NO.  
    
     6. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
        and Protocols? NO// <ENTER>
