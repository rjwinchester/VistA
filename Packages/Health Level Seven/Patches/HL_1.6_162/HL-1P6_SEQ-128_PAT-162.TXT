Subject: EDIT/ADD LOGICAL LINK

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 To allow for the creation of new links via the Link Edit [HL EDIT LOGICAL 
 LINKS] option, the validation logic will allow users to proceed to the 
 edit screen if the link is new.  Also, it will allow users to proceed if
 the Logical Link is a Multithreaded Listener regardless of the SHUTDOWN 
 LLP ? (#14) field value in the HL LOGICAL LINK (#870) file.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 INC000000952806 
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When creating new links via the Link Edit [HL EDIT LOGICAL LINKS] option
 it allows it to be created, but it is not immediately available to edit 
 through the option since it is not considered "shutdown" according to 
 the SHUTDOWN LLP ? (#14) field in the HL LOGICAL LINK (#870) file.
    
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The validation logic has been modified to identify new links by checking 
 if the link has a LLP TYPE (#2) field value in the HL LOGICAL LINK (#870) 
 file populated as an indicator the HL LOGICAL LINK is newly created or 
 incomplete (missing the REQUIRED LLP TYPE (#2) field).  Also,  
 the new validation logic will allow Logical Links to be edited if the 
 TCP/IP SERVICE TYPE (#400.03) field equals 'M' for MULTI LISTENER
 regardless of the SHUTDOWN LLP ? (#14) field value in the HL LOGICAL LINK 
 (#870) file.
