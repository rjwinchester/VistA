 The pre-installation routine will save a copy of the site's DENTAL CPT
 CODE MAPPING (#228) file in a temp global.  The post-installation 
 routine will restore the fields that the site is allowed to define at 
 the local level ($ values, etc). The post-install sends the Mailman

 changes made and the affected ADA/CPT codes.
