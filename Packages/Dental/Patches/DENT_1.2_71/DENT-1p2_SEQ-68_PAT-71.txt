 **********************************************************************
 NOTE: This patch has a shortened compliance date.
 **********************************************************************
  
 The pre-installation routine will save a copy of the site's DENTAL CPT
 CODE MAPPING (#228) file in a temp global.  The post-installation 
 routine will restore the fields that the site is allowed to define at 
 the local level ($ values, etc). The post-install sends the Mailman 
 message to the G.DENTV ADA CODE MAPPING group that describes the 
 changes made and the affected ADA/CPT codes.
