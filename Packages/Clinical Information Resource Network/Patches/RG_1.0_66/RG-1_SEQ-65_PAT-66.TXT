Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ENHANCEMENTS - VIP 1

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems.
  
 RG*1.0*64 is the only required build for patch RG*1.0*66.
   
 NOTE: RG*1.0*66 should NOT be installed on legacy sites.
  
   
 Enhancement
 The Healthcare Identity Management (HC IdM) team has requested an
 enhancement to the Inpatient Pending Edit Request work flow process.
 Currently all Identification (ID) trait updates for admitted patients
 are not allowed to occur in VistA, causing the Master Patient Index
 (MPI) to create an Inpatient Edit Pending Request (Request #6230) in
 Toolkit (TK). Routine RGADPT2 was updated to notify MPI to now log an 
 Inpatient Pending Edit Request (Request #6230) only when an admitted
 patient receives an update for any of the following ID traits:
  
      - Name
      - Date of Birth
      - Date of Death
      - Social Security Number (SSN)
      - Gender
      - Multiple Birth Indicator (MBI)  **Only if being set to YES**
  
 For all remaining ID traits, the update in VistA will be allowed and
 MPI will NOT log an Inpatient Edit Pending Request (Request #6230) in
 TK.
