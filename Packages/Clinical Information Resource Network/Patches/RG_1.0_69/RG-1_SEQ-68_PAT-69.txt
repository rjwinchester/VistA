Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ENHANCEMENTS - NOTIFICATION PROVIDER 

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems or the FORUM CLAIMS system (since it is NOT a Veterans
       Affair Medical Center (VAMC) VistA system).
  
 RG*1.0*51 and RG*1.0*68 are the only required builds for patch RG*1.0*69.
  
 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) enhancements are being distributed in
       three VistA namespaces: DG, MPIF and RG.
       Patches DG*5.3*950, MPIF*1.0*66 and RG*1.0*69 can be installed in
       any order as there are NO dependencies between these patches
       (Do NOT install MPIF*1.0*66 or RG*1.0*69 on legacy sites or on the
        FORUM CLAIMS system). 
  
 NOTE: Legacy sites and the FORUM CLAIMS system can install just the
       DG*5.3*950 patch. MPIF*1.0*66 and RG*1.0*69 should NOT be
       installed on legacy sites or on the FORUM CLAIMS system. 
  
 Enhancement
 The Healthcare Identity Management (HC IdM) business group has requested
 that the Master Veteran Index (MVI) NOT store the Notification Provider
 on the Correlation. Therefore routine RGADTP was modified so that when
 the Admission Discharge Transfer (ADT) A08 Update Health Level Seven (HL7)
 message is created, that the Observation/Result (OBX) segment containing
 Notification Provider is NOT included/transmitted to MVI.  
  
 Issue
 HC IdM has determined that there are a few instances at some sites where
 the FULL ICN (#991.1) field does NOT reflect the combination of the
 INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER (#991.01) and ICN CHECKSUM (#991.02) fields in
 the PATIENT (#2) file. After some analysis, it was determined that the
 Duplicate Patient Record Merge process was NOT updating the FULL ICN
 (#991.1) field when merging from either a Local or National Integration
 Control Number (ICN) to a NULL or Local ICN. Therefore routine RGDRM01 was
 modified so that the FULL ICN (#991.1) field is updated along with the
 other MVI related fields when the Duplicate Patient Record Merge process
 is executed.
