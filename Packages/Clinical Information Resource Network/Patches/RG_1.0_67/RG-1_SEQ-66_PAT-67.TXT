Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ENHANCEMENTS - 'PREFERRED NAME'

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems.
  
 RG*1.0*64, RG*1.0*65, RG*1.0*66 and DG*5.3*937 are the required builds
 for patch RG*1.0*67.
  
 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) enhancements for the new PREFERRED NAME
       field (#.2405) in the PATIENT file (#2) are being distributed in
       two VistA namespaces: DG and RG.
       The only build enforced requirement is that:
         - DG*5.3*937 be installed before RG*1.0*67 
  
 NOTE: Legacy sites can install just the DG*5.3*937 patch. RG*1.0*67
       should NOT be installed on legacy sites.
  
 Enhancements
 The following enhancements exported in this patch will allow the Master
 Veteran Index (MVI) to support the new PREFERRED NAME (#.2405) field in
 the PATIENT (#2) file. 
  
 Enhancement #1
 The Patient Identification (PID) Health Level Seven (HL7) segment parser
 process in routine RGADTP1 was enhanced to extract the new 
 'Preferred Name' value from the PID-5 sequence that was transmitted in
 the HL7 message.    
  
 Enhancement #2
 Routine RGADTP3 was enhanced to update the PREFERRED NAME field (#.2405)
 in the PATIENT file (#2) with the 'Preferred Name' value extracted from
 the PID-5 sequence that was transmitted in the HL7 message.   
    
 Issue
 During the Software Quality Assurance (SQA) testing of this patch, it 
 was determined that the MVI VistA correlation information and the VistA
 site information could become out of sync, without a 1510 Task in
 Toolkit (TK) being created to identify the issue. Routine RGADTP2 was
 modified to ensure that an error flag is appropriately returned to MVI
 when an error is encountered updating a patient's record in VistA. This
 will ensure that a 1510 Task in TK is created and that the MVI 
 Correlation and VistA information are kept in sync.
