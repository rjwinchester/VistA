Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX ISSUES - ITERATION 13

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems.
  
 RG*1.0*59, RG*1.0*61, DG*5.3*902 and XU*8.0*655 are required builds
 for patch RG*1.0*62.
  
 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) enhancements are being distributed
       in three VistA namespaces: DG, RG and MPIF. DG*5.3*902 is
       required to be installed prior to installing RG*1.0*62 and
       MPIF*1.0*60. Once DG*5.3*902 has been installed, patches
       RG*1.0*62 and MPIF*1.0*60 can be installed in any order.
    
  
 Issue #1
 Modifications were made to routine RGHLLOG to discontinue the logging of
 exceptions to the Master Patient Index (MPI) / Patient Demographics 
 (MPI/PD) exception handler. The last exception type, #234 or Primary View
 Rejects (PVRs), will now no longer be logged in the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION 
 LOG (#991.1) file. Therefore the menu option, MPI/PD Exception Handling 
 [RG EXEPTION HANDLING], will be removed, as there are no longer any 
 exceptions for users to process. The exception processing code will 
 remain as there are exceptions that still must pass through from VistA to
 the MPI. 
  
 The post-init routine RGP62PST will mark any "Active" PVRs, type 234 
 exceptions, at the site as "Resolved".  
     
 Issue #2
 Modifications were made to the Admissions, Discharges and Transfers
 (ADT) A08 Health Level Seven (HL7) message builder code in routine 
 RGADTP to support the new Date of Death requirements to the MPI. 
 DEATH ENTERED BY (#.352), SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION (#.353), DATE OF
 DEATH LAST UPDATED (#.354) and LAST EDITED BY (#.355) fields from the
 PATIENT (#2) file will be added to the OBX message segment of the 
 ADT-A08 HL7 message. Additional Date of Death supporting code will be 
 exported in patches DG*5.3*902 and MPIF*1.0*60.
   
 Issue #3
 A new menu option "ToolKit POC User Setup" [RG TK POC USER SETUP] has been
 appended as an item to the MPI/PD Patient Admin Coordinator Menu [RG ADMIN
 COORD MENU] to support point of contact (POC) remote view access. If you 
 are a POC user with Master Veteran Index (MVI) ToolKit access, you will
 want to use this option to establish your Visitor record on the Master
 Patient Index (MPI). In addition, your ToolKit access will also be updated
 to allow you to perform additional actions related to remote data viewing.
 This new POC option will access the MPI to establish a visitor record in 
 the NEW PERSON (#200) file on the MPI if one does not already exist, 
 through a new remote procedure call (RPC) [MPI TK POC USER SETUP]. 
   - If there are any missing required fields identified to your local VistA
     user record in the NEW PERSON (#200) file, (ie. Name, Social Security 
     Number (SSN) or Site), then the user will be instructed to check their
     information via the menu option "Edit an Existing User" [XUSEREDIT] on
     the "User Management" [XUSER] menu, and to contact their local 
     Information Resource Management (IRM) for further assistance if needed. 
     *Note: Users will need to execute this option again once their 
            information has been successfully updated in their local VistA
            NEW PERSON (#200) file.
   - If all required fields are populated in their local VistA NEW PERSON 
     (#200) file, then a Visitor record will be created on the Austin MPI
     and an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document will be automatically
     transmitted from the Austin MPI to the ToolKit (TK) to update the 
     user's DUZ entry, allowing access to the MPI TK functionality.
     *Note: Users MUST already be established in TK prior to using this new
            option. If you are not already established in TK and execute the
            option, you will be required to execute it again once you are
            established.
   - A new routine RGTKPOC was created and associated with this new menu
     option to execute the POC remote view access functionality.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The post-init routine RGP62PST will mark any "Active" 234 exceptions (PVRs)
 in the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION LOG (#991.1) file as resolved. It will only 
 update the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION LOG (#991.1) file in your local VistA. It
 should take less than 5 minutes to run to completion.
  
 The Post-Install routine RGP62PST can be deleted after the patch has been
 installed.
    
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 minutes 
 to install.
  
 The following OPTIONS should be disabled during installation:
        Register a Patient              [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
        Load/Edit Patient Data          [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
        Electronic 10-10EZ Processing   [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING]
        Preregister a Patient           [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]
        UPDATE BATCH JOB FOR HL7 v2.3   [VAFC BATCH UPDATE]
        MPI/PD Patient Admin Coordinator Menu   [RG ADMIN COORD MENU]
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 The HL7 incoming filers should be stopped.  Use the Monitor, Start, Stop
 Filers [HL FILER MONITOR] option on the Filer and Link Management Options
 [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu on the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU].
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch 
     number (i.e. RG*1.0*62):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//', respond as per your facility's policy.  If you
     choose to answer YES, then at the end of the patch installation,
     KIDS will rebuild the menus which may take several hours and could
     disrupt CPRS users.  If your facility has the XQBUILDTREEQUE
     nightly batch job tasked to run, answer NO to this question.
     The nightly job will rebuild the menus as scheduled.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
