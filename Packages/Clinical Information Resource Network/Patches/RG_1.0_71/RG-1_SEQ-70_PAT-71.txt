Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ENHANCEMENTS - SUPPORT LONG NAMES IN VA MPI

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems or the FORUM CLAIMS system (since it is NOT a
       Veterans Affair Medical Center (VAMC) VistA system).
  
 RG*1.0*67, RG*1.0*68 and MPIF*1.0*69 are the required builds for patch
 RG*1.0*71.
  
 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) 'Support for Long Names in VA MPI'
       enhancements are being distributed in three VistA namespaces:
       DG, MPIF and RG.
       The only build enforced requirement for this set of related
       patches is that MPIF*1.0*69 be installed before RG*1.0*71.
       
       (Do NOT install MPIF*1.0*69 or RG*1.0*71 on legacy sites
        or on the FORUM CLAIMS system) 
  
 NOTE: Legacy sites and the FORUM CLAIMS system can install just the
       DG*5.3*974 patch. MPIF*1.0*69 and RG*1.0*71 should NOT be
       installed on legacy sites or on the FORUM CLAIMS system. 
   
 The following enhancements exported in this patch were needed to
 support the collection of the patient's legal name in the Veteran
 Affairs (VA) Master Person Index, which requires MPI to support
 storing patient names and aliases greater than the VistA maximum of
 30 characters in length and to also allow updating of Date of Death
 metadata when the update is triggered through the Override process in
 Toolkit.
  
 Enhancement #1
 MPI as of patch MPI*1.0*125 will start supporting the collection of
 an individual's legal name, which can now exceed VistA's limitation of
 a maximum length of 30 characters on the name and/or alias fields. To
 support this change on the MPI, VistA has been modified with the
 following change so that it will NOT outright reject the value for
 exceeding the 30-character maximum length:
  
   The processor for the incoming Admit Discharge Transfer (ADT) A08 
   (Update Patient) Health Level Seven (HL7) messages has been modified
   so that when a Patient's name and/or alias exceeds 30 characters and
   the NEW Name Components flag is NOT set that a shortened name will
   be generated from the component parts of the name that were sent in
   the HL7 message. That shortened version of the name is then filed
   into the NAME field (#.01) or ALIAS (#1) multiple NAME (#.01) field
   in the PATIENT (#2) file.
  
   NOTE: Prior to this change, long names (Patient Name or Aliases)
         would have been rejected by the input transform and the
         update would have failed.
  
   If the NEW Name Components flag is set to '1' then the name components
   for the 'Name' and 'Aliases' values will be filed directly into the
   NAME COMPONENTS (#20) file. The existing 'ANAME' MUMPS cross-reference
   (X-REF) on the name components fields in the NAME COMPONENTS (#20) file
   will continue to be used to update the corresponding NAME (#.01) and/or
   ALIAS (#1) multiple NAME (#.01) fields in the PATIENT (#2) file. 
  
   NOTE: See patch MPIF*1.0*69 for additional information on the NEW
         Name Components flag stored in the MPI ICN BUILD MANAGEMENT
         (#984.8) file.
  
 Enhancement #2
 The Healthcare Identity Management (HC IdM) business group has requested
 an enhancement that will modify routine RGADTP3 to NOW allow a patient's
 Date of Death (DOD) metadata to be updated ONLY if the update was received
 from the Override (OVR) process in the Person Service Identity Management
 (PSIM) Toolkit (TK), even if there was no change in the DOD. Currently
 only SOURCE OF NOTIFICATION (field #.353) in the PATIENT File (#2) will be
 updated in VistA through this process, as the other DOD metadata items are
 NOT presently synched out to the sites from the MVI. 
  
   Note: The OVR process will be identified by the ARRAY("TKOVRDOD") flag.

 The RG patch back-out procedure would consist of restoring the original
 routines using the back-up message created during the patch installation,
 as there are no additional components nor any other data modifications
 being made in this patch.
  
 If assistance is still required to back-out the patch please contact the
 National Service Desk (NSD) to log a help desk ticket so the development
 team can assist in the process.
  
      Note: This process should only be done with the concurrence and
            participation of the development team and the appropriate
            VA Site/Region personnel.
