Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ISSUES - ITERATION 12

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems.
   
 RG*1.0*59 and RG*1.0*60 are required builds for patch RG*1.0*61.
  
 NOTE: The messaging enhancements for the new SELF IDENTIFIED GENDER
       (#.024) field in the PATIENT (#2) File are being distributed
       in three VistA namespaces: DG, RG and MPIF. The patches should
       be installed in the following order: DG*5.3*876, RG*1.0*61, 
       and then MPIF*1.0*59. After installing DG*5.3*876, it is not
       necessary to wait for the bulletin from the queued Master 
       Patient Index (MPI) Employee data seeding process to complete 
       before moving on with installing RG*1.0*61. However, it is 
       recommended that these three patches be installed within a
       short time window, preferably on the same date if possible.
  
 Issue #1
 The Point Of Contact (POC) add/edit functionality for the Add/Edit
 Point of Contact, [RG UPDATE POINT OF CONTACT], menu option is being
 migrated to the ToolKit (TK) graphical user interface (GUI). The
 VistA process will no longer be accessible to users, as the option
 will be removed from the MPI/PD Patient Admin Coordinator Menu 
 option,[RG ADMIN COORD MENU], and will also be placed out of order
 with the message: Obsolete with RG*1.0*61. Complete removal of this
 functionality from the VistA system will take place at a later date.   
  
 Issue #2
 To address Remedy ticket INC000000860605, modifications were made
 to the routine, RGADTP1, to ensure that large lists of Aliases for
 a patient are processed correctly. Note: This issue only occurs if
 the patient has a large number of Aliases, which subsequently 
 requires a continuation PID(6) Health Level Seven (HL7) segment be
 created. The issue was confined to the processing of these 
 continuation segments only.
  
 Issue #3
 To address Remedy ticket INC000000946297, modifications were made
 to the routine, RGMTAUDP, to prevent users from receiving an 
 undefined error when using the Patient Audit File Print, [RGMT 
 AUDIT PRINT], menu option. Note: Error only manifested itself when
 the user chose to run the report for "SELECTED" fields and "ALL"
 patients.
  
 Issue #4
 Enhancements were made to the ADT-A08 and ACK-A31 HL7 messages sent
 to the MPI to include the following fields from the PATIENT File 
 (#2):
   - SELF IDENTIFIED GENDER (#.024)
   - PERIOD OF SERVICE (#.323)
   - TYPE (#391)
   - VETERAN (Y/N)? (#1901) 
 VETERAN (Y/N)? (#1901) and TYPE (#391) will be located on the ZEL
 segment, PERIOD OF SERVICE (#.323) will be located on the ZSP 
 segment, and SELF IDENTIFIED GENDER (#.024) will be located on the
 OBX segment of the HL7 message. 
  
 Issue #5
 Modifications were made to the ADT-A08 and ACK-A31 Health Level 
 Seven (HL7) messages sent to the Master Patient Index (MPI) to 
 accurately capture the name fields entered or edited in VistA. 
   - The ADT-A08 HL7 message has included an OBX segment which will
     contain the NAME field (#.01) of the PATIENT File (#2), and the
     FAMILY (LAST) LAST NAME (#1), GIVEN (FIRST) NAME (#2), MIDDLE 
     NAME (#3), SUFFIX (#5), and PREFIX (#4) fields of the NAME 
     COMPONENTS File (#20).
   - The ACK-A31 HL7 application acknowledgement sent to the MPI in
     response to an ADT-A31 will include an ERR segment with the
     same data, Patient Name and Name Components, as described in
     the ADT-A08 HL7 message above.

 Documentation Update:
 =====================
 The following MASTER PATIENT INDEX/PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS (MPI/PD)
 VISTA documentation is available, updated for patches DG*5.3*876,
 MPIF*1.0*59, and RG*1.0*61.  Facilities should download the revised
 documentation listed as follows:
  
     User Manual                         RG1_0_UM.PDF

 This transmits the file from the first available FTP server.
 Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from one
 of the following servers.

     HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU].
     
 3.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
