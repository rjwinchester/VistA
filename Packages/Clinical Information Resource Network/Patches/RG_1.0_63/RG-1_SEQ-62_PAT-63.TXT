Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ISSUES - ITERATION 14

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems.
  
 RG*1.0*59 and RG*1.0*62 are the required builds for patch RG*1.0*63.
  
 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) enhancements are being distributed
       in three VistA namespaces: DG, RG and MPIF. RG*1.0*63 has no
       dependencies on the other 2 patches (DG*5.3*915, MPIF*1.0*61)
       and can be installed whenever. 
  
  
 Modifications were made to routines RGADTP and RGADTP3 to process the
 Self-Identified Gender Identity value now being transmitted in the OBX 
 segment of the A31 Health Level Seven (HL7) update message received from
 the Master Patient Index (MPI). The SELF IDENTIFIED GENDER (#.024) field
 in the PATIENT (#2) file will be updated to reflect the transmitted
 Self-Identified Gender Identity value for the patient as it exists on
 the MPI.
