Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ENHANCEMENTS - ITERATION 15

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems.
  
 RG*1.0*59 and RG*1.0*61 are required builds for patch RG*1.0*64.
  
 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) enhancements are being distributed
       in three VistA namespaces: DG, RG and MPIF. RG*1.0*64 has no
       dependencies on the other 2 patches (DG*5.3*919, MPIF*1.0*62)
       and can be installed any time. 
  
 Issue #1  
 Modifications were made to routine RGADTP2 to prevent A31 Health Level
 Seven (HL7) patient update messages from the Master Veteran Index (MVI)
 from being processed when the patient is currently admitted as an
 inpatient at the site. This ensures that any data discrepancies that 
 might have been present in these messages do NOT impact direct patient
 care for admitted patients at the site. However, it does NOT prevent the 
 site from updating their own patient record even if the patient is
 currently admitted as an inpatient.
   (Ex. Patient data changes could cause a conflict with a patient's
        wristband.)
 Note: An Application Accept (AA) response to the A31 HL7 update message
       will be returned to MVI indicating the patient's 'inpatient' 
       admission status and no further processing of the message will
       occur at the site.
  
 Issue #2
 Modifications were also made to routine RGADTP1 to prevent A31 HL7 
 patient update messages from the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA)
 [200CORP, 200BRLS sites] from incorrectly populating the PREFIX (#4)
 and SUFFIX (#5) fields in the NAME COMPONENTS (#20) file by reversing
 the contents. This incorrect population caused filing and displaying
 issues of the NAME (#.01) field in the PATIENT (#2) file and could have
 also caused issues with the NAME (#.01) field of the ALIAS (#1) sub-file. 
 Note: With name standardization, the prefix should never be filed into
       the NAME (#.01) field of the PATIENT (#2) file.
