Description:
============

 Patch PSS*1.0*191 provides enhancements to Pharmacy Data Management to
 support changes to the BCMA and Inpatient Medications applications for
 Transdermal Administrations.
  
        PSS*1.0*191 does not have any dependencies for installation.  
        The full functionality introduced in this patch will not be
        available until patches PSJ*5.0*315, PSB*3.0*83 are installed 
        and possibly PSB*3.0*87 if using BCMA Contingency Back Up (BCBU).
        Pre-existing orders will remain unaffected with installation.  
  
 ******************************* ATTENTION ********************************
  
  Clinical Ancillary Services (CAS) Development-Delivery of Pharmacy 
  Enhancements (DDPE) VA Inpatient Medication Administration - Transdermal
  enhancement includes 5 patches.
  
  This patch adds a new crucial field to the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file
  (#50.7), which is at the center of the Transdermal functionality.
  
  Therefore, it is recommended that this patch be installed a week or more
  in advance of the 4 associated patches, to provide sufficient time to
  review and update the Orderable Item file for all Medications Requiring
  Removal (MRR).
  
 The remaining Clinical Ancillary Services (CAS) Development-Delivery of 
 Pharmacy Enhancements (DDPE) VA Inpatient Medication Administration -
 Transdermal patches must be installed in the following order when
 released:
  
   1.      PSJ*5*315
   2.      PSB*3*83
   3.      PSB*3*87
   4.      OR*3*417
  
  ATTENTION: This enhancement also includes a new Graphical User Interface
  (GUI) executable, BCMA GUI PSB3_P083.EXE. Installation of this GUI is
  required immediately after the KIDS install for the Patch to function.
  
  For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client 
  Installation Instructions section.
  
 **************************************************************************
  
 These enhancements are made to address NSR 20141012. 
      They include: 
  
      1. Currently sites have to create fake removal orders to allow for 
 appropriate removal of medications in BCMA.  This enhancement will 
 alleviate this issue by adding a field to the ORDERABLE ITEM (#50.7) file
 titled PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA (#12).  Addition of this field allows
 for changes that will support enhancements to the BCMA and Inpatient
 Medication applications to display the removal times in Inpatient
 Medication orders using rules determined by the value of this field. The
 PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA (#12) field can be set for Orderable Items that
 require removal to the following values:
  
      NULL/0=No Removal Required 
      1 = Removal at Next Administration 
      2 = Removal Period Optional Prior to Next Administration  
      3 = Removal Period Required Prior to Next Administration
  
      2. A post installation routine, PSS1P191, will update the new PROMPT
 FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA (#12) field to a value of 1 for all Orderable Items
 with a Dosage Form that contains the word "PATCH".  A message will be sent
 to the installer as well as all users holding the PSJU and PSJI MGR keys
 providing a list of Orderable items that were updated during this process.
 The PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA (#12) field is only updated if it is
 currently set to a value of NULL so subsequent installations will not 
 update the PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA (#12) field again.
  
      3. Routines edited for this patch will add the prompt "PROMPT FOR 
 REMOVAL IN BCMA:" to the following three options:
  
      - Edit Orderable Items [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS]
      - Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT]
      - Dispense Drug/Orderable Item Maintenance [PSS MAINTAIN ORDERABLE  
        ITEMS]
  
      4. Patch PSS*1.0*172 inadvertently missed adding the prompt, HIGH 
 RISK/HIGH ALERT, to the following options, which is being added in 
 this patch:
  
       - Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT]
       - Dispense Drug/Orderable Item Maintenance [PSS MAINTAIN ORDERABLE
         ITEMS]
  
       5. A second post install routine PSSP191A will create another email
 report.  This report will display active orders for Medications Requiring
 Removal that do not contain the necessary file structures to allow for the
 new removal functionality to execute.  The primary purpose for this
 information is to allow the site to determine the approximate amount of 
 resources needed to discontinue these orders and re-create them after 
 patch PSJ*5*315 is installed.  Until the PSJ*5*315 patch is installed the 
 capability for processing these orders will not be available.  More 
 detailed procedures and recommendations for this process are in the 
 installation section of this Patch Description. A new option that 
 duplicates this report will be added to the Pharmacy Data Management [PSS 
 MGR] menu as the Orders for MRRs With Removal Properties [PSS MRR ORDERS
 DIAGNOSTIC RPT] option.
  
        6. Two more reports will be added to the Orderable Item Management 
 [PSS ORDERABLE ITEM MANAGEMENT] sub menu as options. The new report
 options, Orderable Items that Require Removal Report [PSS MRR ORDERABLE
 ITEMS RPT] option and Orderable Items Report for High Risk\High Alert [PSS
 HR/HA ORDERABLE ITEMS RPT] option, will allow review of the settings in
 the Orderable Items file (#50.7) for the values of the respective fields
 indicated in the report titles.

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 This patch runs two post-install routines and sends two reports described 
 below. As preparation for PSJ*5*315, there are also new reports that may 
 be run periodically by pharmacy service.
  
 The first post-install routine automatically updates Orderable Items with 
 a Dosage Form that contains the word "PATCH" so that the field PROMPT FOR 
 REMOVAL IN BCMA is set to 1.  This update is necessary to preserve legacy 
 behavior.  The list of orderable items that were updated is emailed to 
 users holding the PSJI MGR and PSJU MGR keys and also the installer of 
 this patch. Section 1.9.1 of the Pharmacy Data Management User Manual 
 contains information about the possible settings and instructions for 
 changing this field if needed.
  
 **NOTE:  This report only identifies patches. There may be other 
 Orderable Items (e.g., nitroglycerin ointment) that should have the PROMPT
 FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA field set.  Sites will need to determine if other 
 items in their PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEMS file fall into this category.
  
 The second post-install routine generates a preliminary patient order 
 report listing the approximate number of active patient orders that may
 need to be discontinued and re-created when the PSJ*5.0*315 patch is
 finally installed.  This report is emailed to holders of the PSJI MGR,
 PSJU MGR, PSJU RPH, and PSJ RPHARM keys, and also the installer of this
 patch.  
  
 In preparation for PSJ*5*315, sites may periodically run "Pharmacy 
 Data Management" [PSS MRR ORDERS DIAGNOSTIC RPT] under "Pharmacy Data
 Management" [PSS MGR] to update the preliminary estimates of active
 patient orders that may need to be discontinued and recreated.  Sites may
 also run the Orderable Items that Require Removal Report [PSS MRR
 ORDERABLE ITEMS RPT] under "Orderable Item Management" [PSS ORDERABLE 
 ITEM MANAGEMENT] to verify which Orderable Items have been marked for
 PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA. These are the on-demand version of the reports
 generated by the post-install routines.
  
 **NOTE: No action should be taken on active patient orders listed in the 
 patient order report until after patch PSJ*5.0*315 is installed.
  
 After both PSJ*5*315 has been installed and PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA 
 (#12) field have been updated for relevant orderable items, sites should 
 generate a new "Orders for MRRs With Removal Properties" [PSS MRR ORDERS 
 DIAGNOSTIC RPT] report for the most current and accurate list of orders 
 that need to be addressed.  
  
 The post install routine, PSSP191, is deleted automatically after 
 installation.  The second post install routine, PSSP191A, should be
 manually deleted by sites after installation.
