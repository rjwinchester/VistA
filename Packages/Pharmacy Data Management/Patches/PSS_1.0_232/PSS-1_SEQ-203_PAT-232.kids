Noth Texas VAMC reported a problem when trying to use the Drug Enter/Edit

"BLD",10936,1,18,0)

Resolution:
"BLD",10936,1,23,0)
-----------
"BLD",10936,1,24,0)
The problem was a result of an internal call to Fileman to save the lab test
"BLD",10936,1,25,0)
data. Fileman was getting lost because it found more than one match to the
"BLD",10936,1,26,0)
IEN for 'BLOOD' in the TOPOGRAPHY FIELD file (#61) because it did not 
"BLD",10936,1,27,0)
restrict the lookup to IEN only and other entries in that file had the 
"BLD",10936,1,28,0)
ABBREVIATION field (#6) set with a value that matched the IEN for 'BLOOD'.
