                 associated with the drug Clozapine that needs labs
                 attached so that drug checks can be performed.

 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) INC2574335
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 North Texas VAMC reported a problem when trying to use the Drug Enter/Edit
 [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option to mark a dispense drug as a 'Clozapine'
 drug. After entering the lab test (WBC) and Specimen Type (BLOOD) they
 would get a double question mark (??) after answering 'YES' at the 'Is
 this Correct?' prompt. 
        
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The problem was a result of an internal call to VA FileMan to save the lab
 test data. VA FileMan was getting lost because it found more than one
 match to the Internal Entry Number (IEN) for 'BLOOD' in the TOPOGRAPHY
 FIELD (#61) file because it did not restrict the lookup to IEN only and
 other entries in that file had the ABBREVIATION (#6) field set with a
 value that matched the IEN for 'BLOOD'.
   
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed the routine PSSCLOZ at CLOZAD2+2 to use 4 slashes (////) instead of
 3 slashes (///) when saving SPECIMEN TYPE (#2) field, as shown below:
  
  S DIC("DR")="2////"_PSSPTYN_";3///"_PSSTUFF

       other changes, such as DDs or templates.
    
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
       is installed. It compares all components of this patch:  routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
       
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you

 Post Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 None.
  
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
 ;;1.0;PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT;**[Patch List]**;9/30/97
   
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;1.0;PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT;**[Patch List]**;9/30/97;Build 1

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.
