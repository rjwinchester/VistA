Associated patches: (v)PSS*1*206   <<= must be installed BEFORE `PSS*1*224'

Subject: MOCHA 2.1B WARRANTY ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Medication Order Check HealthCare Application (MOCHA) 2.1B patches 
 implement Max Daily Dose Order Checks for simple medication orders 
 entered through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), Inpatient 
 Medications and Outpatient Pharmacy. If the Daily Dose exceeds the First 
 Databank (FDB) recommended Max Daily Dose, a warning shall be displayed 
 to the user. If the Max Daily Dose Order Check cannot be performed, an 
 error message will be displayed to the user, along with general dosing 
 information for the drug in most cases.
  
 This patch is part of the warranty period and includes minor fixes for the
 MOCHA Enhancements 2.1B group of builds. A multiple package host file was
 created to simplify installation at Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
 facilities for the other portions. The combined host file
 MOCHA_2_1_WARRANTY_OR_PSO_PSJ.KID contains OR*3.0*481, PSJ*5.0*358 and
 PSO*7.0*518.  In addition, there is this standalone Pharmacy Data
 Management patch, PSS*1.0*224, which must be installed in conjunction with
 the other builds.
  
  
 The Pharmacy Data Management MOCHA v2.1B warranty fixes will provide the
 following corrections:
  
 When 'PRN' is appended to a Schedule, the frequency should be the same
 as that schedule. The site reported this wasn't the case. This patch will
 correct this issue.
  
 Certain generic messages for CPRS are combined in scenarios where they 
 appeared redundant.
  
 The Recommended Frequency message, when displayed in Pharmacy, will now 
 always be the last Dosing Order Check message to display.
  
 The entry 'PUMP(S)' will be added to the DOSE UNITS (#51.24) File. This 
 will enable Dose Checks to occur on certain products where before they 
 could not, for example a drug matched to the VA Product of TESTOSTERONE 
 1.62% 20.25MG/PUMP GEL,TOP.
  
 A scenario was discovered where the General Dosing Guidelines displayed
 in Outpatient Pharmacy for a complex order when a combination of 'And'
 and 'Then' conjunctions were used in the order. A change was made in
 Pharmacy Data Management to never return General Dosing Guidelines to
 Outpatient Pharmacy for display within a complex order.

 Installation Considerations/Restrictions:
 ========================================
 These patches should be installed when Pharmacy applications are not in 
 use, no other pharmacy patches are being installed, and when tasked jobs 
 from Clinical Applications are not running. 
  
 Installation should also occur when CPRS usage is at a minimum, 
 particularly medication activities.
  
 Installation should take less than one minute.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 =========================
 MOCHA Warranty software must be installed together in the following 
 sequence:
  
      Component                       File Name
    1 PSS*1.0*224                     PSS_1_224.KID
    2 MOCHA Warranty Combined Build   MOCHA_2_1_WARRANTY_OR_PSO_PSJ.KID  
  
 1. Download PSS_1_224.KID into your local directory.
  
 2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu, 
    select the Installation menu.
  
 3. Use Load a Distribution. You may need to prepend a directory 
    name. When prompted for "Enter a Host File:", respond with
    PSS_1_224.KID.
  
      Example: USER$:[ABC]PSS_1_224.KID
  
 4. From the Installation menu, you may then select to use the following
    three options. These options are optional. If used, when prompted for
    the INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*224.
  
         Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
         Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the 
         components of the KIDS build.
  
         Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch 
         is installed.
  
 5. Select the installation option Backup a Transport Global. This 
    option will create a backup message of any routines exported with 
    this patch in case you need to backout this patch. It will not backup
    any other changes such as Data Dictionaries (DD's) or templates. It 
    is important this step be followed, because if backout of this patch 
    is necessary, having this backup will make the process much easier.
  
 6. Select the Installation option Install Package(s). This is the 
    step to start the installation of this KIDS patch: 
   
    a. Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch install 
       and enter PSS*1.0*224 at the INSTALL NAME prompt.
  
    b. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//' answer NO.
  
    c. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
       and Protocols? NO//' answer NO.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions
 ==============================
  
 Upon completion of the PSS*1.0*224 patch install, a VistA mail message is
 sent to members of the 'PSS ORDER CHECKS' Mail Group and the patch 
 installer. This mail message indicates whether or not the Post-Init 
 routine successfully added the new Unit of PUMP(S) to the DOSE UNITS
 (#51.24) File. You may continue with the installation of the MOCHA
 combined build patch regardless, but if the process failed please follow
 up with the National Help Desk to get assistance looking into the issue.
  
    Example Mail Message of a successful Post-Init:
  
 From: PSS*1.0*224 INSTALL  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 PSS*1.0*224 patch installation has completed.
  
 The new Dose Unit of PUMP(S) was successfully added to your DOSE
 UNITS (#51.24) File, no further action is necessary.
  
  
  
    Example Mail Message of an unsuccessful Post-Init:
  
 From: PSS*1.0*224 INSTALL  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PSS*1.0*224 patch installation has completed.
  
 A problem was encountered when adding/verifying the new PUMP(S) entry in
 your DOSE UNITS (#51.24) File. It is OK to install the remaining Mocha 
 2.1b warranty patches, but contact the national help desk for assistance
 with this Dose Unit problem. Refer to the PSS*1.0*224 patch installation
 in the ticket.
  
  
 Backout Procedures
 ==================
  
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of the 
 development team, health product support and appropriate VA site/region 
 personnel. The decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint
 decision between the development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing PSS*1.0*224, the site/region should have saved a
 backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport
 Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install). The
 message containing the backed up routines can be installed with the 
 "Xtract PackMan" action at the Message Action prompt, then function 6 -
 INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE. If for some reason the backup is not available, one
 can be provided by customer support or the development team. Please call
 the national help desk or enter a helpdesk ticket if a backup is not
 available.
  
  
 ************************************* Note****************************** 
 If patch PSS*1*224 is backed out, the MOCHA 2.1 COMBINED WARRANTY BUILD 
 1.0 will also need to be backed out. Use the following sequence if it is 
 determined a back-out is necessary:
  
 1.  Back-out of MOCHA 2.1 COMBINED WARRANTY BUILD 1.0
 2.  Back-out of PSS*1.0*224 ***must be done immediately after step 1***
 3.  List Templates replaced as soon as possible after step 2 but not
     required to be immediate
 **************************************************************************
  
  
 When backing out PSS*1.0*224, also delete these new routines introduced 
 by this patch:
   
    PSS224PI
    PSSDSEXF
  
 These 2 routines can be deleted by using the following option:
  
    Select Routine Tools <TEST ACCOUNT> Option: Delete Routines
  
    ROUTINE DELETE
  
    All Routines? No => No
  
    Routine:   <ENTER ROUTINE NAME HERE>
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 =================================
  
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSS Routines contained in this patch using the First Line Routine
 Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT] option. Once the routines contained in the
 PSS*1.0*224 patch have been rolled back, the second line of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSS*1.0*224.
