  - Input Template

Description:
============

 This patch will install additional VistA code in support for the 
 replacement of the current National Drug File Management System (NDFMS)
 monthly update functionality via the FORUM patch process.
  
 This patch is being released in conjunction with National Drug File 
 (NDF) patch PSN*4.0*396 which adds new fields for VA PRODUCT FILE 
 (#50.68). 
  
 Patch Components:
 -----------------
 Patch PSS*1*195 will provide the following enhancements:
  
    ** NOTE **
    Changes were made to display data for the new data dictionary (DD)
    fields added in PSN*4*396. The new fields will only display if
    information is defined. In this release, data will not be populated 
    for the new fields except for a default value of NO for CLINICAL
    EFFECTS OF DRUG multiple (#50.68108).
  
    The areas affected in the options are product selection list and the
    body of the listing. The product selection list is where the product
    identifiers are normally displayed and the body of the listing is where
    the data displays for fields.
  
  1. The Lookup into Dispense Drug File [PSS LOOK] option has been
     modified to include the following fields from VA PRODUCT file 
     (#50.68) when values are defined:
  
       HAZARDOUS TO HANDLE field (#101)
       HAZARDOUS TO DISPOSE field (#102)
       PRIMARY EPA CODE field (#103)   
       WASTE SORT CODE field (#104)
       DOT SHIPPING CODE field (#105)  
       FORMULARY DESIGNATOR field (#109)       
       FORMULARY DESIGNATOR TEXT field (#110)
  
     Users will not see these fields populated or displayed as data will
     not be present with patch PSS*1*195.
  
     When data is populated in a future patch, the hazardous waste group of
     fields will display after CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE. FORMULARY DESIGNATOR
     field (#109) will display after NATIONAL FORMULARY INDICATOR and
     FORMULARY DESIGNATOR TEXT field (#110) will display as "Product Text"
     after NATIONAL RESTRICTION".
  
         Hazardous to Handle: NO
         Hazardous to Dispose: YES
         Primary EPA Code: P001
          Waste Sort Code: PBKC
        DOT Shipping Name: Toxic Liquids, Organic, n.o.s.
        
        Formulary Designator: PA-N
        Product Text: This product requires approval at the national level
        prior to  dispensing.  See PBM Criteria for Use.
  
  
  2. The Lookup Dosing Check Info for Drug [PSS DRUG DOSING LOOKUP] option
     has been modified to include Clinical Effects of the Drug 
     multiple (#50.68108) that includes:
  
       CLINICAL EFFECTS multiple (#50.68108) for:
          PACKAGE field (#.01)
          OMIT EXP/DC ORDER CHECK field (#1)
          DURATION LIMIT field (#2)
  
     The DURATION LIMIT field (#2) defines the time frame that expired and
     discontinued orders are omitted from Medication Order Check
     Application (MOCHA) enhanced order checking. The default value of NO
     will be displayed after LOCAL POSSIBLE DOSAGES.  Example:
  
        CLINICAL EFFECT DURATION: NO
  
     When data is populated in a future patch, the rest of the clinical
     effects multiple fields will be displayed after LOCAL POSSIBLE
     DOSAGES (i.e. PACKAGE field (#.01), OMIT EXP/DC ORDER CHECK field 
     (#1), and DURATION LIMIT field (#2).  Example:
  
        CLINICAL EFFECT DURATION: YES
          BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT DURATION LIMIT: 45d
             OMIT EXP/DC ORDER CHECK: NO 
  
   3. The Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option has been modified to
      include the Formulary Designator in the drug selection list, after
      NATIONAL FORUMULARY INDICATOR in the body of texts, in the product
      selection list when matching a drug to the National Drug file, and on
      the match acceptance screen.  Additionally the PSSCOMMON input
      template was edited to display the Formulary Designator group of
      fields after NATIONAL FORMULARY DESIGNATOR.
  
   4. The Pharmacy System file (#59.7) was changed to include the PPS-N 
      ACCOUNT TYPE field (#17).  This field is used to indicate the type of
      Pharmacy Product  System - National (PPS-N) account.  The account
      type can be one of the following: "Q" for National Test SQA system,
      "T" for Test/Mirror Account, "S" for Product Support, "N" for QA
      NDFMS account, or "P" for Production account.
  
      Local VA sites will only use "P" for their production account and "T"
      for their test/mirror accounts.
