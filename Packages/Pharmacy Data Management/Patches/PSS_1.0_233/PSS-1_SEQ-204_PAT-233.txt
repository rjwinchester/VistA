Subject: DISPLAY ISSUES IN THE LOOKUP INTO DISPENSE DRUG FILE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses some display issues in the Lookup into Dispense 
 Drug File [PSS LOOK] option.
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 INC2027665  Display issues in the Lookup into Dispense Drug File [PSS 
 LOOK] option
    
 Problem: 
 --------
 In various sections of the Lookup into Dispense Drug File [PSS LOOK]
 option, the line wrapping is not displaying properly for the following:
  
 -      A long Veteran's Administration (VA) Product Name
 -      A long Orderable Item Name
 -      The New Warning Label Section
  
 When the New Warning Label goes longer than the current screen, the user
 is prompted to Press Return to continue or "^" to exit.  If the user
 enters "^" they will not exit from the New Warning Label display and
 the process will continue.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 To resolve this issue, code was modified in routine PSSLOOK so the wrapping
 is displaying properly.  PSSWRNE was modified to return the user's request
 to exit back to PSSLOOK for proper processing.
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Martinsburg VAMC
 Oklahoma City VA HCS

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from this patch description.
