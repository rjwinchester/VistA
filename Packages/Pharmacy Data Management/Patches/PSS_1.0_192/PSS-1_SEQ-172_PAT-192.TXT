 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the applications 
 involved in this project along with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH

 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  1. Three new fields for ePharmacy billable assessment have been added to the
     Drug File (#50) which will be Yes/No fields:
  
        ePharmacy Billable (#84)
        ePharmacy Billable (TRICARE) (#85)
        ePharmacy Billable (CHAMPVA) (#86)
  
     The fields will be used in Integrated Billing to assess billable status
     for a prescription instead of basing assessment on the DEA, Special HDLG
     field.  
  
  2. A new field called Sensitive Diagnosis Drug (#87) has been added to the
     Drug File (#50) which will be a Yes/No field.  The field is used in
     Integrated Billing to assess sensitive diagnosis status for a prescription
     instead of basing the assessment on the DEA, Special HDLG field.
  
  3. The system option Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] contains prompts
     to allow the user to enter the new ePharmacy data at the main level.
  
  4. The help text references to "E" and "U" have been removed from the DEA,
     Special HDLG field, however, the user will still be able to enter "E" or
     "U". If the user enters an "E" or "U" in the DEA, Special HDLG field, a
     warning message is displayed indicating the values no longer have any
     ePharmacy impact and refer the user to the new fields which replace the
     "E" and "U" functionality.
  
  5. The option Lookup into Dispense Drug File [PSS LOOK] displays the
     following new ePharmacy values:
   
        ePharmacy Billable
        ePharmacy Billable (TRICARE)
        ePharmacy Billable (CHAMPVA)
        Sensitive Diagnosis Drug
  
  6. During the patch installation, the system populates the ePharmacy Billable
     field according to existing logic based on values in the DEA, Special HDLG
     field, and removes the "E" from the DEA, Special HDLG field.  Also, the
     system populates the Sensitive Diagnosis Drug field to Yes if the DEA,
     Special HDLG field contains "U" and removes the "U" from the DEA, Special
     HDLG field.
  
  7. The system generates one post installation report showing the value of the
     DEA Special HDLG field before the patch is installed and the value of the
     DEA Special HDLG field after the patch is installed and the "E" and "U"
     characters are removed.  The functions of both characters have been
     replaced by the new DRUG file (#50) fields to maintain consistency
     throughout the VA.  A drug will only be on the report if the value for the
     DEA Special HDLG field is changed for that drug.  The report also displays
     drugs that do not have any value in the DEA Special Handling Field.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named PSS192PO.
 The purpose of the post-install routine is to:
  
  a. Examine every drug in the Drug file (#50) to determine if it is billable
     or not and if the drug is a Sensitive Diagnosis Drug or not.
  b. Set the new ePharmacy Billable field as appropriate.
  c. Set the new Sensitive Diagnosis Drug field as appropriate.
  d. Remove the "E" and "U" characters from the DEA, Special HDLG field.
  e. Identify and report all drugs with a blank DEA, Special HDLG field. 
  f. Prepare and send an email message containing all of the Drug file changes
     to users who hold the PSO EPHARMACY SITE MANAGER security key.
  
 The post-install routine is automatically deleted by the system if allowed by 
 your Kernel site parameters configuration. You may delete this routine if the 
 installation was successful and it is not automatically deleted by KIDS.
