Subject: ORDERABLE LIST, DRUG INTERACTION CHECK SCROLLING AND VARIABLE CLEANUP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issues:
  
 1) The API DRGIEN^PSS50P7 that returns the Dispense Drugs in the DRUG 
    file (#50) matched to a PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) is not 
    returning all matches if a Dispense Drug happens to have the same 
    internal entry number in the DRUG (#50) file as the PHARMACY ORDERABLE 
    ITEM (#50.7) file entry it points to.  
  
 2) Lines may scroll off the screen when checking drug interactions.  The 
    user may not be aware that not all lines are displaying on the screen.
  
 3) Outpatient Pharmacy CK Action not working after Check Drug 
    Interactions option if user enters "^" to exit.

 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1) I9845797FY16 - Dispense Drug and Ordering Item Same IEN Issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
  
    The application programming interface (API) DRGIEN^PSS50P7 that returns
    the Dispense Drugs in the DRUG file (#50) matched to a PHARMACY
    ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) is not returning all matches if a Dispense
    Drug happens to have the same internal entry number in the DRUG file
    (#50) as the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) entry it points to. 
    This issue will cause not all dispense drugs tied to an orderable item 
    being displayed to a user when that user invokes menu options which 
    depend on this API.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
  
    A change was made at DRGIEN+13^PSS50P7 so that a cross-reference is
    used for look-up and removing the logic that prevents drugs from being 
    viewed if those drugs happen to have the same internal entry number
    (IEN) as the Pharmacy Orderable Item.
  
    Routine: PSS50P7
    
 2) I9845950FY16 - Check Drug Interaction Option Scrolling Issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    
    When using the Check Drug Interaction option [PSS CHECK DRUG 
    INTERACTION], when the monograph is displayed, the first several lines 
    scroll off the screen. the user may not realize that there is
    additional information, and if they do, they have to scroll back to see
    it. 
  
    This also happens when the CK Hidden Action (Check Interactions) is
    used in Outpatient Pharmacy and Inpatient Medications.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
  
    Change routine PSSDIUTL so that text will not scroll off the screen.  
    Instead, the user is prompted to press "enter" to continue or enter "^"
    to exit if not enough room is left on the screen.
  
    Routine: PSSDIUTL
  
 3) I9169866FY16 - Check Drug Interaction Variable Clean-Up
  
    Problem:
    --------
  
    If a user invokes the PSS CHECK DRUG INTERACTION OPTION but immediately
    exits out, and then invokes Patient Prescription Processing, the CK 
    action will not be functional.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
  
    Modify routine PSSDIUTL so that variables are properly cleaned up when 
    the user exits the option.
  
    Routine: PSSDIUTL
