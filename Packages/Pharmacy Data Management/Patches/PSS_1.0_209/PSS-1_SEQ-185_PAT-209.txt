 1. I7443594FY16 - New BUPRENORPHINE Dosage Form approved for treatment 
    of chronic pain necessitates an update in the Detox API
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    Buprenorphine-containing products for treatment of opiate addiction 
    require an Detox/Maintenance ID number for a provider to order the
    medication with the exception of those that are approved for pain
    management. One such exception is Butrans (buprenorphine
    transdermal).  This medication is available for pain management in both
    PATCH and FILM,BUCCAL dosage forms.
  
    Patch PSS*1*183 modified DETOX^PSSOPKI to provide an exception for the 
    Detox/Maintenance ID number when the product dosage form contains the
    phrase "PATCH". It is requested that dosage form "FILM,BUCCAL" be
    excluded from the Detox/Maintenance ID number  check, as well.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSSOPKI has been modified to add a check for "FILM,BUCCAL" 
    and exclude it from the Detox/Maintenance ID number check.

 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
  
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
   
 3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select

    following options.  When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter
    the patch # (ex. PSS*1.0*209):
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not 
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch

       routines, DDs, templates, etc.
  
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
  
 Installation Verification:
 -------------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first
 2 lines of the routines contained in the patch. The second line
 will contain the patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;1.0;PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT;**[PATCH LIST]**;9/30/97;Build #
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] 
 can be run to compare the routine checksums to what is documented
 in the patch description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and
 participation of development team and appropriate VA site/region
 personnel. The decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint
 decision between development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSS*1.0*209 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSS*1.0*209 in
 the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;1.0;PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT;**[Patch List]**;9/30/97;Build 3
