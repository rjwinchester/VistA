Subject: MOCHA 2.1B ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Medication Order Check HealthCare Application (MOCHA) 2.1B patches 
 implement Max Daily Dose Order Checks for simple medication orders 
 entered through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), Inpatient 
 Medications and Outpatient Pharmacy. If the Daily Dose exceeds the First 
 Databank (FDB) recommended Max Daily Dose, a warning shall be displayed 
 to the user. If the Max Daily Dose Order Check cannot be performed, an 
 error message will be displayed to the user, along with general dosing 
 information for the drug in most cases.
  
 This patch is part of the MOCHA Enhancements 2.1B group of builds and must
 be the first of the group installed. Multiple package host files were
 created where possible to simplify installation at Veterans Health
 Administration (VHA) facilities. The combined build host file
 MOCHA_2_1_PSO_OR_PSJ.KID contains OR*3.0*382, PSJ*5.0*256 and PSO*7.0*402.
 The combined follow up host file MOCHA_2_1_FOLLOW_UP_PSO_OR_PSJ.KID
 contains PSO*7.0*500, OR*3.0*469 and PSJ*5.0*347. In addition, there is
 another standalone Pharmacy Data Management patch, PSS*1.0*206, which must
 be installed in conjunction with the other builds.
  
                               * * * Notice * * *
                   This group of patches should not be installed 
                       until the follow on patch PSO*7.0*515
            has been released and is ready to be immediately installed.
                PSO*7.0*515 must be installed immediately after the
                  successful installation of this group of builds.
               See the PSO*7.0*515 patch description for details.
