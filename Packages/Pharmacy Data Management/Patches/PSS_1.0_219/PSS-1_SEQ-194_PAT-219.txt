Subject: BUPRENORPHINE TX OF PAIN XPAR UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 New functionality is being introduced to control the ability to prescribe
 Buprenorphine medications. Previously, the logic was checking to see if a
 drug contained the term 'BUPREN' and was of dosage form 'PATCH' to
 determine whether or not a provider needs a DEA number to prescribe the
 medication. Instead of using hard coded values, a new parameter is 
 introduced to control the prescribing of Buprenorphine containing 
 medication. Buprenorphine containing products may be ordered by providers 
 who do not have a detox number if the products are being ordered for the 
 treatment of pain.
  
 The new functionality introduces a multiple valued XPAR parameter to hold 
 all of the possible dosage forms for utilization of products that contain 
 Buprenorphine and are being used for the treatment of pain. The new XPAR
 parameter 'Dosage Forms Buprenorphine Tx of Pain [PSS BURENORPHINE PAIN 
 DFS] is being delivered and pre-populated with the dosage forms of 
 'PATCH' and 'FILM,BUCCAL'. In addition to the drug containing the term 
 'BUPREN', the new parameter is now used to determine a provider's ability
 to prescribe a medication based on the pre-populated values in the
 parameter.
  
 A new option 'Manage Buprenorphine Tx of Pain Dosage Forms' [PSS 
 BUPRENORPHINE DOSAGE FORMS] has been created to allow users to manage 
 the contents of the new parameter as the FDA approves additional dosage
 forms in the future. This option is placed on the menu option 'Dosages'
 [PSS DOSAGES MANAGEMENT] menu option.

 Item #1:
 --------
 Currently, the function DETOX^PSSOPKI is hard-coded to check for a dosage 
 form of 'Film, Buccal' and 'Patch' to determine a provider's ability to 
 prescribe a buprenorphine containing product.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A new XPAR parameter 'Dosage Forms Buprenorphine Tx of Pain [PSS 
 BUPRENORPHINE PAIN DFS] has been created with an instance type of 
 'sequence' and a 'value' type as a pointer to the DOSAGE FORM file 
 (#50.606). DETOX^PSSOPKI has been modified to look at the values 
 configured in the new XPAR parameter. The post-install will pre-populate 
 the new parameter with the values 'FILM,BUCCAL' and 'PATCH' at the 
 PACKAGE level for the parameter. This replaces the existing hard-coded 
 logic with a parameter that can be updated with new dosage forms as they 
 are identified for use in treatment of pain. Such products may be ordered 
 by providers who do not have a detox number.
  
 The new option 'Manage Buprenorphine Tx of Pain Dosage Forms' [PSS 
 BUPRENORPHINE DOSAGE FORMS] is now accessible through the 'Dosages' [PSS 
 DOSAGES MANAGEMENT] menu option.

 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
 Patch PSS*1.0*219 will install updates to routine PSSOPKI, adds the new 
 XPAR parameter, populates the parameter, and adds the new buprenorphine 
 option appropriately.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch 
     PSS*1.0*219.
  
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  Select the installation option Backup a Transport Global. This 
     option will create a backup message of any routines exported with 
     this patch in case you need to backout this patch. It will not backup
     any other changes such as Data Dictionaries (DD's) or templates. It 
     is important this step be followed, because if backout of this patch 
     is necessary, having the backup will make the process much easier.
  
 5.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//', answer 'NO'.  
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//', answer 'NO'
  
 8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//', answer 'NO'.
  
 9.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 The post installation routine will pre-populate the new XPAR parameter
 with the proper dosage forms. No user interaction is required.
  
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
  
 Back-out Procedures are only needed if there are major problems (examples 
 include the KIDS notice of incompletion or hard errors) resulting from the
 installation of this patch. You must have concurrence from Health Product
 Support before a rollback can occur. Enter a ServiceNow helpdesk ticket to
 obtain this concurrence. The development team will then assist with the
 backout process.
  
 Prior to installing a patch, the site/region should have saved a backup 
 of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport Global 
 [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install). The message 
 containing the backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" 
 function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function 
 "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up routines 
 onto the VistA System.
   
   
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
  
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the 
 PSS*1.0*219 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSS*1.0*219 in 
 the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;1.0;PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT;**[Patch List]**;9/30/97;Build 14
