Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 ******************************** ATTENTION *******************************
  
 FDA Medication Guide On- Demand and Automatic Printing functionality 
 includes 3 patches which must be installed in the following order:
  
 1.  PSS*1.0*177 - Vista patch that updates the Pharmacy System File (File 
     #59.7) FDA MED GUIDE SERVER URL field (Field 100) with the new secure
     CMOP SharePoint URL.
  
 2.  PSO*7.0*428 - Information only patch that contains instructions to 
     update the FDA Med Guide Automatic Printing Java Application Component
     installed on servers to work with the new secure CMOP SharePoint URL.
  
 3.  PSN*4.0*364 - Information only patch that contains instructions to 
     update the FDA Med Guide On-Demand Viewing Java Application Component
     installed on individual workstations to work with the new secure CMOP
     SharePoint URL.
  
 If your site is currently utilizing the FDA Med Guide Auto Printing  or 
 On-Demand software,  the updated Java Application Components included in
 this release,  must be installed immediately following the installation of
 PSS*1.0*177.  Failure to do so will disable the FDA Med Guide On-Demand
 and Automatic printing functionality until the updated Java Application
 Component software is installed.
  
 ***If your site does not utilize the FDA Med Guide On-Demand or Auto 
    Printing software, you only need to install Vista patch PSS*1.0*177 
    and no further action on PSO*7*428 and PSN*4*364 is necessary.***
  
 **************************************************************************
  
 On-Demand and Automatic printing of FDA Med Guides were originally stored 
 on an un-secured CMOP SharePoint.  A new secure CMOP SharePoint has been 
 created and new and updated FDA Med guides are now added to the new secure
 SharePoint. 
  
 The old CMOP SharePoint address is hard-coded and stored in the Pharmacy
 System File (File #59.7) FDA MED GUIDE SERVER URL field (Field #100).
  
 This patch will update the Pharmacy System File (File #59.7) FDA MED GUIDE
 SERVER URL field (Field #100) with the new secure CMOP SharePoint URL.
  
 Post-init routine PSS177P will change the FDA MED GUIDE SERVER URL field
 from this:
  
 "http://vaww.national.cmop.domain.ext/FDAMedGuides/"
  
 to this:
  
 "https://vaww.cmopnational.domain.ext/CR/FDAMedGuides/".
  
  
 Patches PSN*4*364 (On-Demand Viewing) and PS0*7*428 (Automatic Printing) 
 will be released at the same time as this patch, PSS*1.0*177.  These 
 information only patches contain instructions to retrieve the necessary
 files and documentation to update the Java Application Component software
 to make this URL work with the system.
  
 This patch (PSS*1*177) only makes the file update and does not alter any
 VistA functionality.
