Subject: ERRORS WITH PSS LOOK AND PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT OPTIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues:
  
 1) Errors when using the Lookup into Dispense Drug File [PSS LOOK] option
    in VistA
  
 2) Hard error within Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option for Lab
    Monitoring
  
 3) Duplicate prompt to create a new Orderable Item when entering a new
    DRUG (#50) file entry
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1)  CA-SDM R17777273FY18 - Errors when using the PSS LOOK option in VistA
      dup  I17850187FY18
      dup  INC0170207
      dup  INC0808490     
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 While using the Lookup into Dispense Drug File [PSS LOOK] option, a hard
 error is encountered when looking up a DRUG (#50) file entry that is
 currently unmatched from the National Drug File (NDF) but had been
 previously matched to the NDF.
  
 When a drug is unmatched from the NDF the first 6 pieces of the "ND" node
 are deleted.  Only the first 5 pieces should be deleted to retain the
 NATIONAL DRUG CLASS (#25) field in the file.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routines PSSDEE1 & PSSLOOK to delete only the first
 5 pieces of the "ND" node when a drug is unmatched from the National Drug
 File.
  
  
 2)  CA-SDM I17578782FY18 - Hard error within PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT option for
                            Lab Monitor
  
 Problem:
 ========
 While using the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option on a
 Clozapine drug for Outpatient Meds, when prompted to mark/unmark as a LAB
 MONITOR or CLOZAPINE DRUG, the user selects Lab Monitor, then uses the "^"
 to get out of the option and receives an UNDEFINED error in VistA.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routine PSSDEE to ensure the UNDEFINED error 
 does not occur and that the user is properly exited from the option.
  
  
 3)  CA-SDM I18167971FY18 - Duplicate prompt to Create a New Orderable Item
                            when entering a new drug file entry.
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The user creates a new DRUG (#50) file entry related to the creation of a
 new orderable item. During the process, the user chooses to link the new
 DRUG (#50) file entry to an existing orderable item but responds "NO"
 after an existing entry is selected. Then they "^" out and choose to
 create a new orderable item. After the new orderable item is created, a
 second prompt for creating a new orderable item is presented.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routines PSSPOIMN and PSSPOIM1 so that the 
 'Select DRUG GENERIC NAME' prompt displays, instead of a duplicate 
 'Create a new Orderable Item to match?' prompt.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 2 minutes
 to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------- 
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
    Installation Menu.
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select Backup a Transport Global and when
    prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch PSS*1.0*220. This option
    will create a backup message of any routines exported with this patch.
    It will not backup any other changes such as DDs or templates. If for
    any reason the patch is to be rolled back, this backup will be required
    to restore the patch's routine(s) to the pre-installation version(s).
  
 5. From the Installation Menu, you may elect to use the following options.
    When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch: PSS*1.0*220 
  
     a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
     
     b. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to print only 
        a summary of the patch, to print a summary of the patch and the
        routines in the transport global, or to print only the routines in
        the transport global.
  
     c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed. (It compares all components of this patch's routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
 6. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    choose the patch to install.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//' 
    respond 'NO'.
  
 8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? NO//' respond 'NO'.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from this patch description.
