 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) INC0000000174282 - Problem with PSS LOOK option
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The VistA option 'Lookup into Dispense Drug File' [PSS LOOK] does not work
    the same as the 'Drug File Inquiry' [PSB DRUG INQUIRY] option.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------- 
    The routine ^PSSLOOK will be modified so the VistA option 'Lookup into
    Dispense Drug File' [PSS LOOK] option to include the SYNONYM field
    (#.01) of the SYNONYM sub-file (#9) of the DRG file (#50) during the
    lookup the same way the 'Drug File Inquiry' [PSB DRUG INQUIRY] option
    does the lookup.
   
    The ^PSSLOOK routine will also be modified to include the DRUG IEN
    (Internal Entry Number) on the 1st line of the output following the name
    of the drug.
  
 2) INC0000000230104 - Using Drug Enter/Edit Option in PDM, local possible
                      dosage merge performed automatically.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When Using Drug Enter/Edit Option in PDM (Pharmacy Data Management), local 
    possible dosage merge performed automatically. This happens before the
    user gets asked the question 'Do you want to merge new Local Possible
    Dosages?'
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    ^PSSUTIL routine will be modified to prevent the creation of a record
    with null values in the DOSE UNIT field (#4) and the NUMERIC DOSE field
    (#5) of the LOCAL POSSIBLE DOSEAGE field (#.01) of the LOCAL POSSIBLE 
    DOSAGE sub-file (#50.0904) of the DRUG file (#50).
  
 3) INC0000000347730 - Errors in reminder index for non-VA meds
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The VistA 'Clinical Reminders Index Build' [PXRM INDEX BUILD] option is
    used to create and rebuild the Clinical Reminders Index. The Clinical
    Reminders Index Build creates the discontinued date in a different format
    for Non VA Meds, than for Outpatient Pharmacy system. This format
    difference in the discontinued date causes the Clinical Reminders to be
    inaccurate.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The VistA 'Clinical Reminders Index Build' [PXRM INDEX BUILD] option will
    be modified to set the discontinued date for the Non VA Meds index in the
    correct format.
  
    A post-install routine ^PSSP170 will be created to clean up the incorrect
    discontinued date subscript stored in the cross-reference global.
  
 4) INC0000000500625 - Medication Reconciliation national component displaying
                      on scalp instead of subcutaneous
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When users change the name of a Medication Instruction using the VistA
    Medication Instruction File Add/Edit [PSSJU MI] option, the system does
    not perform the duplicate entry check.  This allows users to create
    duplicate entries which in turn causes the Medication Reconciliation to 
    display the incorrect data.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The input transform for the NAME field (.01) of the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION
    file(#51) will be modified to check the "B" index for the existence of
    the new entry. If the entry exists, the user will not be allowed to make
    the change. The SYNONYM field (.5) will be modified to force uppercase
    values to ensure consistence with the NAME field (.01).
  
    The help text for the NAME field (.01) and the SYNONYM field (.5) will
    also be modified to inform the user that the NAME and SYNONYM fields must
    be unique.
  
    A post-install routine ^PSSP170 will examine the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION
    file(#51) and identify any SYNONYM's that are duplicates or contain
    mixed/lowercase letters. This list will be sent via Mailman to the holders
    of the "PSJU MGR" security key.
  
 5) INC0000000507504 - User unable to mark/unmark drugs for (Consolidated Mail
                      Outpatient Pharmacy) CMOP
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the VistA 'CMOP Mark/Unmark (Single drug)' [PSSXX MARK] option
    and the users tries to mark or unmark drugs for CMOP the system displays
    "Do you wish to mark this drug to transmit to CMOP?"
    "Enter Yes or No: "
    If the user enters a "Yes" or "No" response, the system repeats the
    prompt.
    If the user enters a "Y", "y", "N" or "n" the system accepts the entry.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The ^PSSMARK routine called by the VistA option "CMOP Mark/Unmark (Single
    drug)" [PSSXX MARK] will be modified to accept all variances of a Yes/No
    answer.
