Subject: NDF DISPLAY/PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT/IV ADDITIVE PRINT NAME

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch addresses three (3) issues:
  
 1. When using the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option for a drug 
    that has been unmatched from the National Drug File (NDF), the NATIONAL
    FORUMULARY INDICATOR field(#29) on the screen displays 'YES' instead of
    'Not Matched to NDF'.
  
 2. The Data Dictionary for the DRUG file (#50) PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT 
    field (#16) is incorrect.  The Prompt Message displays "Type a Number 
    between 0 and 222, 4 decimal digits".  This does not accurately reflect 
    the data stored in this field.  There are many drug items on the 
    market with a price per dispense unit greater than $222.
    The Data Dictionary needs to be updated to more accurately reflect the
    content of the field.
                
 3. There is an issue with the PRINT NAME field (#.01) in the IV ADDITIVE 
    file (#52.6) when it contains a tilde (~).  When an IV label is printed
    for an additive that has a print name that contains a tilde, it may not 
    display the amount of the IV additive. When the tilde is removed, the
    IV additive amount will print.

    Problem: 
    ========
    When using the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option for a drug 
    that has been unmatched from the NDF, the NATIONAL FORUMULARY INDICATOR
    field (#29) on the screen displays 'YES' instead of 'Not Matched to
    NDF'.
  
    The reason is that during unmatching, the code in SETNULL^PSSDEE1 sets 
    many fields in the "ND" node in the DRUG file (#50) to NULL, but it does 
    not alter the NATIONAL FORMULARY INDICATOR field (#29).  
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Changed code in SETNULL^PSSDEE1 to null the sixth and eleventh pieces
    of the "ND" node in the DRUG file (#50) when the drug is unmatched.
  
    Before patch installation:
  
    SETNULL  S ZXZX=$P(^PSDRUG(DA,"ND"),"^",2),$P(^PSDRUG(DA,"ND"),"^",1)="",
               $P(^PSDRUG(DA,"ND"),"^",2)="",$P(^PSDRUG(DA,"ND"),"^",3)="",
               $P(^PSDRUG(DA,"ND"),"^",4)="",$P(^PSDRUG(DA,"ND"),"^",5)="",
               $P(^PSDRUG(DA,"ND"),"^",10)="" D NULL1
             Q
  
    After patch installation:
  
    SETNULL  S ZXZX=$P(^PSDRUG(DA,"ND"),"^",2)
             F I=1:1:6,10,11 S $P(^PSDRUG(DA,"ND"),"^",I)=""
             D NULL1
             Q
   
 2. I11741762FY17
    I8658700FY16 
   
    Problem:
    ========
    The Data Dictionary for the DRUG file (#50) PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT 
    field (#16) is incorrect.  The Prompt Message displays "Type a Number 
    between 0 and 222, 4 decimal digits".  This does not accurately reflect 
    the data stored in this field.  There are many drug items on the 
    market with a price per dispense unit greater than $222. The Data
    Dictionary needs to be updated to more accurately reflect the content
    of the field.
  
    The PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#16) in the DRUG file (#50), 
    is a calculated field:
  
    Price Per Order Unit / Dispense Units Per Order Unit = Price Per 
    Dispense Unit
  
    The field in the Data Dictionary only allows an amount between 0 and 222 
    and 4 decimal places, via FileMan.  However, the field will store
    larger calculated amounts up to 999999.0000.
  
    The PRICE PER ORDER UNIT(#13) field and the PRICE PER ORDER UNIT 
    (#402) synonym field need to be modified, as well, to handle six digit
    numbers.
  
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
  
    The Input Transform for the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#16)
    needs to be changed from:
    K:+X'=X!(X>222)!(X<0)!(X?.E1"".""5N.N) X"
  
    to:
    K:+X'=X!(X>999999)!(X<0)!(X?.E1"".""5N.N) X"
  
    The Help Prompt Message also needs to be changed from:
    Type a Number between 0 and 222, 4 Decimal Digits
  
    to:
    Type a Number between 0 and 999999, 4 Decimal Digits
  
  
    The Input Transform and help prompts for the PRICE PER ORDER UNIT
    fields (#13) and (#402) need to be changed, as well, to handle
    six-digit fields.
  
    From:
    INPUT TRANSFORM:  S:X["$" X=$P(X,"$",2) 
    K:X'?.N.1".".2N!(X>99999)!(X<0)!(X?.E1"."3.N) X
    HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Dollar Amount between 0 and 99999, 2 Decimal 
    Digits.
  
    To:
    INPUT TRANSFORM:  S:X["$" X=$P(X,"$",2) 
    K:X'?.N.1".".2N!(X>999999)!(X<0)!(X?.E1"."3.N) X
    HELP-PROMPT:      Type a Dollar Amount between 0 and 999999, 2 Decimal 
    Digits.
  
  
  
    A post-installation routine, ^PSS208P, was written to recalculate
    the Price Per Dispense Unit and store it correctly in the DRUG file
    (#50). It will also generate a MailMan message of all the drugs where
    the changes were made and will send it to PSNMGR, PSAMGR and PSA ORDERS
    key holders. 
  
 3. I11266042FY17
  
    Problem:
    ========
    There is an issue with the PRINT NAME field (#.01) in the IV ADDITIVE 
    file (#52.6) when it contains a tilde (~).  When an IV label is printed
    for an additive that has a print name that contains a tilde, it may not 
    display the amount of the IV additive. When the tilde is removed, the
    IV additive amount will print.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Current Input Transform for PRINT NAME field (#.01):
    K:$L(X)>30!(X?.N)!($L(X)<3)!'(X'?1P.E)!(X'?.ANP) X
  
    Current Help Prompt Message:
    Name must be 3-30 characters, not numeric or starting with punctuation
  
    New Input Transform for PRINT NAME field (#.01):
    K:$L(X)>30!(X?.N)!($L(X)<3)!'(X'?1P.E)!(X'?.ANP)!(X["~") X               
  
    New Help Prompt Message:
    Name must be 3 - 30 Characters, not numeric, not starting with
    punctuation or containing tilde
  
    Note:  The label print routines have an issue with tilde (~) in
    particular, since it is used in the DATA variable as a delimiter.  
    VistA takes care of the most common delimiter, ^, which cannot be used, 
    but ~ needs to be screened out.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 A post-installation routine, ^PSS208P, will clean up the PRICE PER 
 DISPENSE UNIT DRUG field (#16) and store it correctly in the DRUG file 
 (#50).  A MailMan message will be generated to show all the drugs where 
 changes were made and be sent to PSNMGR, PSAMGR and PSA ORDERS key 
 holders.

 Post Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 The post installation PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT clean-up routine, ^PSS208P, 
 is not automatically deleted as part of the installation process. You may 
 delete it after installation if you desire. 
  
 Example: 
 VISTAS1:VISTA>D ^%RDELETE
  
 Delete routines/INCLUDE files.
 WARNING: When <rtn>.MAC.0 is deleted, the latest backup is moved
          to <rtn>.MAC.0, UNCOMPILED.
  
 Routine(s): PSS208P 
  
 Once the post installation routine has run to completion, the installer
 and users with Security Keys PSNMGR, PSAMGR and PSA ORDERS will receive a 
 MailMan message that includes a report of changes made by the clean-up 
 process.
  
 NOTE:  Due to limited space on the email report, leading zeroes have been 
 removed from the NDC field and PPDU dollar amounts have been rounded to 
 two decimal places.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and
 participation of development team and appropriate VA site/region
 personnel. The decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint
 decision between development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 As part of the back-out procedure, the mail message that was generated 
 during the post-install can be used to restore the value for the PRICE
 PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#16) of the DRUG file (#50).
