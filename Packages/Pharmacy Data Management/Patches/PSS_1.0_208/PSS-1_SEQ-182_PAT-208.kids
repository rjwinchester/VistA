This patch addresses three (3) issues:
"BLD",10557,1,2,0)
 
"BLD",10557,1,3,0)
1. When using Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] Option for a drug
"BLD",10557,1,4,0)
   that has been unmatched from the NDF, the NATIONAL FORUMULARY
"BLD",10557,1,5,0)
   INDICATOR field on the screen displays 'YES" instead of 'NOT
"BLD",10557,1,6,0)
   Matched to NDF'.
"BLD",10557,1,7,0)
 
"BLD",10557,1,8,0)
2. The Data Dictionary for the DRUG File (#50) PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT 
"BLD",10557,1,9,0)
   Field (#16) is incorrect.  The Prompt Message displays "Type a Number 
"BLD",10557,1,10,0)
   between 0 and 222, 4 decimal digits".  This does not accurately   
"BLD",10557,1,11,0)
   reflect the data stored in this field.  There are many drug items
"BLD",10557,1,12,0)
   on the market with a Price Per Dispense Unit greater than $222.
"BLD",10557,1,13,0)
   
"BLD",10557,1,14,0)
   The Data Dictionary needs to be updated to more accurately reflect
"BLD",10557,1,15,0)
   the content of the field. 
"BLD",10557,1,16,0)
  
"BLD",10557,1,17,0)
3. There is an issue with the PRINT NAME Field (#.01) in the IV ADDITIVE 
"BLD",10557,1,18,0)
   File (#52.6) when it contains a tilde (~).  When an IV label is 
"BLD",10557,1,19,0)
   printed for an additive that has a print name that contains a tilde, 
"BLD",10557,1,20,0)
   it may not display the amount of the IV additive.  When the tilde is
"BLD",10557,1,21,0)
   removed, the IV additive amount will print.
