 Ticket Overview:
 ================
  
 1. I6674562FY16: Drug Renewal Error
  
    Problem:
    --------
  
    An error will occur during the renewal process if a lengthy drug-drug
    interaction order checking message is generated.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
   
    Modify routine PSSHRQ21 to not duplicate drug-drug interaction 
    sentences for medications ordered multiple times.
  
    Routine: PSSHRQ21
  
 2) I9845326FY16: Option PSS SCHEDULE EDIT Error
  
    Problem:
    --------
  
    An error might occur in option PSS SCHEDULE EDIT if the user uses the
    "^" feature to skip fields and jump ahead to various fields in the
    ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE (#51.1) file.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
  
    A change was made to routine PSSJEEU to set a standard FileMan variable
    DIE("NO^") to the value "BACKOUTOK" before invoking the edit feature.  
    The variable setting will allow users to jump back to previously edited
    fields (BACK) and to exit (OUTOK) but prevents users from jumping ahead
    during the editing process.
  
    Routine: PSSJEEU
  
 3) I9845463FY16: Interface Scheduler Option Issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
  
    Numerous background tasks might be tasked if the scheduling frequency
    in option PSS SCHEDULE PEPS INTERFACE CK is set to a low value.  System
    performance issues may then occur.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
  
    Inform the user that the recommended scheduling frequency is 15 
    minutes. Warn the user that the scheduling frequency should not be set
    to a value lower than five minutes.  The user is required to 
    acknowledge the warning message before continuing to the next step
    which invokes the TaskMan option XUTM SCHEDULE.
  
    New message:
  
    The recommended "Rescheduling Frequency" is 15 minutes (900 seconds).
  
    It is currently set to 900S.
  
    WARNING: Do not decrease the "Rescheduling Frequency" below 5 minutes.
  
               System issues could occur after a downtime due to
               multiple jobs being tasked.
  
      Continue to the TaskMan Schedule/Unschedule Option? NO//
  
    Routine: PSSHRIT
  
 4) I7730375FY16: Check PEPS Services Option issue
  
    Problem:
    -------- 
  
    The latest VA Custom Update downgraded the drug interaction severity 
    level for Aspirin and Warfarin so they no longer trigger a drug-drug 
    interaction warning. That drug combination is hard-coded into the PSS
    CHECK PEPS SERVICES SETUP to confirm that drug-drug interactions are 
    working correctly. A new drug combination needs to be substituted.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
  
    The option PSS CHECK PEPS SERVICES SETUP now checks for the drug-drug 
    interaction of Warfarin and Ciprofloxacin.  The drug combination of 
    Warfarin and Ciprofloxacin is "critical".
    
  
    Routine: PSSHRIT
