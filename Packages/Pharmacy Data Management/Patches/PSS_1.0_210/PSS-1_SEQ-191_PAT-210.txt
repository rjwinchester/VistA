Subject: ADMIN SCHEDULE FILE CHANGES/ORDERABLE ITEM 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two (2) issues:
  
 1.  Free text is accepted in the NAME field (#.01) of the 
     ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) when the TYPE OF
     SCHEDULE field (#5) is set to D (Day of the Week).
                             
 2.  Changes made to the NAME field (#.01) of the 
     PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#50.7) via the Edit 
     Orderable Items [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS] option are   
     not always reflected in the ORDERABLE ITEMS file 
     (#101.43).
                
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. I9862869FY16
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Free text is accepted in NAME field (#.01) of the 
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) when the TYPE 
 OF SCHEDULE field (#5) is set to D (Day of the Week).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines ^PSSJSV and ^PSSJEEU require modifications  
 in order to eliminate the entry of free text if the 
 TYPE OF SCHEDULE field (#5) is set to D.
  
 Post-installation routine ^PSS1P210 will loop through
 the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) and provide
 a report detailing schedule names that need to be
 changed due to a Day of the Week Schedule Type.
  
 2. I9863047FY16
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Changes made to the PRINT NAME field (#.01) of 
 the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#50.7) via the Edit 
 Orderable Items [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS] option are   
 not always reflected in the ORDERABLE ITEMS file 
 (#101.43).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Issue occurs when ^ is used to exit the screen at
 the OI DRUG TEXT ENTRY prompt. The PHARMACY ORDERABLE
 ITEMS NAME field on the screen does not message  
 changes to the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43),  
 but subsequent fields do. Modification to subroutine 
 SYN^PSSPOIMO will eliminate this problem and update  
 the name change data.

 Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore// 
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and
 participation of development team and appropriate VA site/region
 personnel. The decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint
 decision between development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSS*1.0*210 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSS*1.0*210 in
 the patch list section on line 2.
