Subject: ISSUES CONCERNING: STRENGTH CHANGE, DRUG SYNONYM, AND DRUG TEXT 

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch addresses three (3) issues:
  
 1. Users may not be aware that changing a drug's Strength does not change
    the Concentration.
  
 2. The FileMan Description on the SYNONYM (#.01) field of the SYNONYM 
    SUB-FIELD (#50.1) file for the DRUG (#50) file does not match the
    Input Transform.
  
 3. Incorrect cross references may remain and errors may occur during
    execution of the Drug Text Enter/Edit [PSS EDIT TEXT] option.

 Remedy Overview:
 ===============
 1. INC000000985782 - Strength Change Issue
    
    Problem:
    -------
    While performing option Enter/Edit Dosages [PSS EDIT DOSAGES], users
    might not notice that editing the Strength does not change the
    Concentration.
  
    This situation was discussed during a SUMPM (Safety Updates for
    Medication Prescription Management) User Group meeting on 06/25/2015,
    and it was agreed that there is not a valid solution available to the
    National Drug File Manager to handle this for the IV drugs.  It was 
    suggested to display a warning when editing the strength stating that 
    "Editing the strength will not change the concentration".
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Routine PSSDOSER has been modified to display a warning when editing
    the strength stating that "Editing the strength will not change the
    concentration".
    
    Routine: PSSDOSER
  
 2. INC000000977971 - Drug Synonym Issue
  
    Problem:
    -------
    The Input Transform logic on the SYNONYM (#.01) sub-field in the DRUG 
    (#50) file does not match the description.  The current logic checks to
    make sure the length of the synonym is between one and 40 characters.  
    The description indicates that the length should not be less than six
    characters if the synonym is all numeric and between one and forty
    characters if not all numeric.
  
    This ticket was discussed during the SUMPM (Safety Updates for
    Medication Prescription Management) User Group meeting on 09/17/2015.  
    It was agreed that the Input Transform logic is correct and the
    description should be changed to match the logic.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    The Description on the SYNONYM (#.01) sub-field of the SYNONYM 
    SUB-FIELD (#50.1) file for the DRUG (#50) file Data Dictionary has been
    changed to accurately reflect the Input Transform.
  
    Routine: None

 3. INC000001286920 - PSS EDIT TEXT Option Issues
  
    Problem:
    -------
  
    Two issues related to the Drug Text Enter/Edit [PSS EDIT TEXT] option:
  
    1)  A previous cross reference, which is now incorrect, might remain
        in the DRUG TEXT (#51.7) file after editing the NAME (#.01) field.
  
    2)  A <SUBSCRIPT> error occurs if the user:
  
        a.  Deletes the TEXT (#3) field entry of the DRUG TEXT (#51.7)
            file.
        b.  Without leaving the option, adds a Synonym and Inactivation
            Date.
        c.  Re-enters option and enters the Synonym at the DRUG TEXT NAME 
            prompt, and attempts to enter a new Name.
  
        The root cause of the error is that the entire entry in the DRUG
        TEXT (#51.7) file is deleted if the TEXT (#3) field entry is
        deleted.  But then a file fragment is set if the Synonym and
        Inactivation Date are added.
  
    Resolutions:
    -----------
    1)  Modify routine PSSTXT to follow the same logic as the Data
        Dictionary settings for the NAME (#.01) field of the DRUG TEXT
        ENTRY (#51.7) file when editing the NAME.  The NAME entry is
        truncated to 30 characters before being set or deleted as a cross
        reference.
  
    2)  Modify routine PSSTXT to warn the user that deleting the text will
        delete the entire entry from DRUG TEXT (#51.7) file.  If the user
        proceeds and deletes all text lines (or does not define any text
        lines for a new entry), an additional message displays that the
        entry has been deleted from the DRUG TEXT (#51.7) file and the
        Synonym and Inactivation Date will not be asked.  Therefore, a 
        file fragment will not be set in the DRUG TEXT (#51.7) file 
        containing only the Synonym and Inactivation Date.
  
    3)  The post install routine PSSP194 will:
  
        a) Clean up incorrect cross references.
  
        b) Send a MailMan message to the patch installer containing
           detailed information regarding which items were cleaned up.
  
           **This MailMan message should be forwarded to the Pharmacy 
             ADPAC for review.
  
        c) Set a trace file (global ^XTMP subscripted by "PSSP194") which
           will automatically purge after 90 days containing the same
           information as the MailMan message in case there are questions
           later and the MailMan message was deleted.

 Data Dictionary for DRUG (#50) file, SYNONYM SUB-FIELD (#50.1) file, 
 SYNONYM (#.01) field, Description has been updated from this:
  
 DESCRIPTION:                This field is used as a quick code for look
                             ups or to locate NDCs so the drug's inventory
                             can be incremented when orders are received.
                                
                             Entries in this field will be restricted.
                             These restrictions will: 
                             - Prohibit any entry that is all numeric
                               and less than 6 characters.  
                             - Convert any entry which matches the
                               NDC-Expiration Date provided by
                               the Robot Rx software. The input
                               transform will strip the leading "3" 
                               and the expiration date from the
                               barcoded NDC.

       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
