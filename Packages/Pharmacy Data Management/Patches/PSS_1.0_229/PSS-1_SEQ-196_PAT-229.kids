"BLD",11112,1,22,0)
Modified routines PSSVIDRG and ORMFN to preserve quick order settings on 
"BLD",11112,1,23,0)
additives and solutions.  These changes also prevented the error which 
"BLD",11112,1,24,0)
occurred when a solution or additive was defined to have unit doses as 
"BLD",11112,1,25,0)
"quick order only".
"BLD",11112,1,26,0)
 
"BLD",11112,1,27,0)
Routine ORMFN is included in patch OR*3.0*487U which will be installed 
"BLD",11112,1,28,0)
along with routine PSSVIDRG in this patch.
