 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 INC1144685 - Tramadol listed in two classes
  
  
           
 Problem: 
 --------
 It was reported that if the drug class is changed, the "VAC" 
 cross-reference between drug class (NATIONAL DRUG CLASS field #25) and 
 the DRUG file (#50) items are not cleaned up, both the old entry and the
 new entries still exist.
  
        
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch carries changes to logic of updating the VA CLASSIFICATION
 field (#2) of the DRUG file (#50) to delete the old class when updating 
 the drug class. Also, the 'VAC' index will be re-indexed as part of the
 post-install routine.

 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
  ;;1.0;PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT;**[Patch List]**;SEP 1997
   
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;1.0;PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT;**[Patch List]**;9/30/97;Build 3

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.

Routine Name: PSS235PO
    Before:       n/a   After:   B810445  **235**
