Description:
============

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PLEASE NOTE: Patch PSS*1.0*227 is a replacement patch for PSS*1.0*203 
 and contains much of the same functionality. Before installing 
 PSS*1.0*227, make sure that PSS*1.0*203 has not been installed at your 
 site. If patch PSS*1.0*203 has been installed at your site, contact the 
 National Service Desk (NSD) to submit a help desk ticket requesting 
 backout of patch PSS*1.0*203. The development team will then assist with
 the backout process.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Patch PSS*1.0*227 provides the following enhancements to VistA:
  
      *  Enables auditing of drug file changes when a user modifies 
         certain fields in the DRUG file (#50) through the Drug Enter/Edit 
         [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] menu option. This enhancement generates a 
         message to a new mail group called PSS DEE AUDIT when these fields
         are modified. The message shows the date/time of the change, the 
         name of the user who made the change, and before/after 
         descriptions of the changed field(s).
  
         In addition, a new Pharmacy Price Tracker function sends a 
         separate audit message to the PSS DEE AUDIT mail group when the 
         PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#16) is added or changed, or when 
         the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field is automatically updated by a 
         change to the PRICE PER ORDER UNIT field (#13).
  
         Not all fields in the DRUG file are subject to audit. The
         following list of auditable fields is stored internally in the
         PSSDEEA routine:
  
         GENERIC NAME (#.01)
         VA CLASSIFICATION (#2)
         DEA, SPECIAL HDLG (#3)
         MAXIMUM DOSE PER DAY (#4)
         STANDARD SIG (#5)
         FSN (#6)
         WARNING LABEL (#8)
         MESSAGE (#101)
         PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM (#2.1)
         RESTRICTION (#102)
         APPLICATION PACKAGES' USE (#63)
         NDC (#31)
         CMOP DISPENSE (#213)
         ATC MNEMONIC (#212.2)
         REORDER LEVEL (#11)
         ORDER UNIT (#12)
         PRICE PER ORDER UNIT (#13)
         PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT (#16)
         SOURCE OF SUPPLY (#17)
         DISPENSE UNIT (#14.5)
         CURRENT INVENTORY (#50)
         DAW CODE (#81)
         NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT (#82)
         NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER (#83)
         INACTIVE DATE (#100)
         NATIONAL DRUG FILE ENTRY (#20)
         VA PRODUCT NAME (#21)
         PSNDF VA PRODUCT NAME ENTRY (#22)
         PACKAGE SIZE (#23)
         PACKAGE TYPE (#24)
         NATIONAL DRUG CLASS (#25)
         CMOP ID (#27)
         NATIONAL FORMULARY INDICATOR (#29)
         EPHARMACY BILLABLE (#84)
         EPHARMACY BILLABLE (TRICARE) (#85)
         EPHARMACY BILLABLE (CHAMPVA) (#86)
         SENSITIVE DIAGNOSIS DRUG (#87)
  
         If a user makes changes to an auditable field, then the mail 
         message Subject line displays the title DRUG ENTER/EDIT AUDIT
         along with the Internal Entry Number (IEN) and name of the drug.
         The message body shows the date/time of the change, the name of
         the user who made the change, and before/after descriptions of the
         changed field(s). 
  
         If a user makes changes to a non-auditable field, or views any
         field but does not make changes, then the mail message Subject
         line displays the title DRUG ENTER/EDIT ACCESS along with the drug
         IEN and name. The message body indicates "No Audited Changes
         Made." 
  
         After installation of this patch, a designated mail coordinator 
         must modify the PSS DEE AUDIT mail group to include the necessary 
         recipients. 
  
      *  Provides an audit history for price changes made in the 
         DRUG file (#50). When the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field (#16) is 
         added or changed, or when the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field is
         automatically updated by a change to the PRICE PER ORDER UNIT
         field (#13), the system will store the following data in the
         DT/TM DISP UNIT PRICE CHANGED field (#50.095) in the DRUG file:
         the date and time of the update; the user who updated the field;
         and the new value in the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field. The
         DT/TM DISP UNIT PRICE CHANGED field is searchable via FileMan, and
         is viewable using either FileMan or the Lookup into Dispense Drug
         File [PSS LOOK] option.
  
         The new PSS DRUG AUDIT RETENTION MOS parameter, accessed 
         through the Edit Parameter Values [XPAR EDIT PARAMETER] option
         under the General Parameter Tools [XPAR MENU TOOLS] menu, is
         used to limit the historical data held in the DT/TM DISP UNIT 
         PRICE CHANGED field. This parameter can be set to a positive whole
         number of retention months. The time period for retaining
         historical data is based on the last date of a price change, minus
         the parameter value (retention months) times 30 days. That is, the
         retention period is based on 30-day months, counting back from the
         last price change. Only those entries that fall within this time
         period will be stored in the field. If the parameter is not set to
         a whole number of retention months, then all entries in the DT/TM
         DISP UNIT PRICE CHANGED field will be retained.
  
         This modification enables pharmacies to better manage drug prices 
         by verifying that the price shown is up to date, and by providing
         a price update history.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 Review the Pre-Installation Instructions provided before beginning 
 installation of the patch.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system, although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes
 to install.
  
 For both single and multi-divisional (integrated) sites, the installer
 must identify a specific user as the Mail Group Coordinator. This
 individual will coordinate the recipients of the MailMan messages. This is
 usually a Pharmacy Informaticist or ADPAC. Once identified, the Mail Group
 Coordinator will be able to add new users to the Mail Group PSS DEE AUDIT
 to allow those users to receive Drug File Audit Mailman messages.
        
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
  
 To install the patch:
  
 1.      Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.      Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3.      From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) Menu,
         select the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to
         use the following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME,
         enter the patch number PSS*1.0*227.
  
         a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will 
         help ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
  
         b. Print Transport Global - This option will enable viewing the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
         c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         enable viewing all changes that will be made when this patch is
         installed. It compares all components of this patch (routines,
         data dictionaries, templates, etc.).
  
         d. Back up a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not back
         up any other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
  
 4.      From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option 
         and choose the patch to install.
  
 5.      When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
         NO//', press <Enter>.
  
 6.      When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
         and Protocols? NO//', press <Enter>.
  
 7.      If prompted 'Delay install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//', press <Enter>.
  
 8.      If prompted 'Enter the Device you want to print the Install 
         messages. You can queue the install by enter a 'Q' at the device
         prompt. Enter a '^' to abort the install. DEVICE: HOME//   HOME  
         (CRT)', press <Enter>.
  
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
  
 The Mail Group Coordinator user identified during installation will need
 to add new users to the PSS DEE AUDIT mail group in order for them to
 receive Mailman messages regarding edits to the DRUG file (#50).  They
 should use the EDIT MAIL GROUP (XMEDITMG) option to do this.  New users
 may be entered as 'I' (Informational) or 'CC' (Carbon-copy) users, as
 appropriate. The installer should notify the Mail Group Coordinator that
 this task must be performed.
  
 Follow the steps below to set the PSS DRUG AUDIT RETENTION MOS parameter, 
 if a time period for storing historical data is required. See the 
 Description section above for more information on how this parameter is 
 used. To set the parameter, contact a VistA programmer, Clinical 
 Application Coordinator (CAC), or similar user with access to the General
 Parameter Tools [XPAR MENU TOOLS] option in VistA.
  
    1. Log in to VistA.
  
    2. At the "Select OPTION NAME:" prompt, type XPAR MENU TOOLS and then 
       press Enter.
  
    3. At the "Select General Parameter Tools Option:" prompt, type EP and 
       then press Enter.
  
    4. At the "Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME:" prompt, type PSS DRUG 
       AUDIT RETENTION MOS and then press Enter.

 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of this patch, it is not recommended for 
 backout. However, in the event that a site decides to back out this 
 patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit 
 a help desk ticket. The development team will then assist with the backout
 process.
  
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the PSS routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the PSS routines have been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain the
 designation of patch PSS*1.0*227 on line 2 in the patch list section.
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out; it does not confirm that other patch component changes 
 have been backed out.
  
 **************************NOTE ON ROUTINE INFORMATION*********************
 Routines PSSDEEA and PSSPRICE are new with PSS*1*227 so most sites will 
 not have a "before" checksum when running CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.  When running 
 option "Verify Checksums in Transport Global [XPD PRINT CHECKSUM]", sites 
 may see a "Not on current system" message for routines PSSDEEA and 
 PSSPRICE.  If you see this message, this is normal and does not indicate 
 any problem with the patch.  You may safely proceed with installation.  
 This checksum message is a result from entered-in-error patch PSS*1*203 
 which had previously updated the checksums for these routines.  
 **************************************************************************
