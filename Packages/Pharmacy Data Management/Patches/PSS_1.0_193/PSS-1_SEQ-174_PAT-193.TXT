Subject: PHARMACY INTERFACE AUTOMATION PROJECT (PIA)

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Other

Description:
============

 The Pharmacy Interface Automation Project will provide a new standard
 bi-directional Health Level Seven (HL7) interface to the Pharmacy
 Automated Dispensing Equipment (PADE) located at the point of care areas
 such as Inpatient wards, Outpatient Clinics etc. The outbound HL7 messages
 will be triggered when drugs are added or modified depending on the site
 parameter setup.
  
 The following two patches are provided for this project:
   PSJ*5*317 - Inpatient Medications V. 5.0.
   PSS*1*193 - Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0.
  
 Note: The patches should be installed in the order listed above as the 
 logical link, PSJ PADE used in the PSS patch is transported in the PSJ
 patch.
  
 As part of this patch PSS*1*193, the following enhancements were made:
  
 1. Two new protocols PSS MFNM01 CLIENT and PSS MFNM01 SERVER were added to
 facilitate sending Master Files Notification (MFN) HL7 drug messages to
 PADE.
  
 2. The Send Entire Drug File to External Interface [PSS MASTER FILE 
 ALL]  option was modified to allow transmission of the drug file to an 
 Inpatient Interface (PADE) depending on the PADE setup. It also 
 provides the flexibility of sending all drugs marked for Unit Dose, 
 Intravenous (IV) or Ward Stock or send selected drugs to PADE.
  
 Since this option now allows to send all or selected drugs to PADE, the
 option name "Send Entire Drug File to External Interface" was changed  
 to "Send Drug File Entries to External Interface"
  
 3. A new PSS PADE INIT security key was added so that holders of this key 
 can only send "all" drugs to PADE noted in item 2.
  
 4. Option Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] was modified to send an 
 addition/update/both or none to PADE provided it is setup to receive such
 updates.
