Subject: FIX ERRORS CALLING DOSAGE CHECK

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1)  Dosing check fails when values are added and then deleted from field  
 DRUG(S) FOR DOSING CHK FREQ (#11.1) in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE FILE 
 (#51.1)
  
 2)  Dosing check fails when an OLD SCHEDULE NAME(S) is used with a PRN 
 designation.
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1)  INC1605330 - Problem with Daily Dose Check when DRUGS FOR DOSING CHK 
 are defined and then completely deleted.
  
 Problem
 =======
 When evaluating the Schedule for the Daily Dose Check, an entry in the 
 DOSING CHECK FREQUENCY (#11) Field in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE (#51.1) 
 File takes precedence over the Number of Admin times for a Day of Week 
 Schedule.  
 The DOSING CHECK FREQUENCY value (if one exists) should be used if there 
 are no Drugs entered in the DRUG(S) FOR DOSING CHK FREQ (#11.1) sub file 
 of the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE (#51.1) File, or the Dispense Drug 
 associated with the order is entered as a value in that multiple, or 
 there is only an Orderable Item passed into the Dose check API call from 
 CPRS, and all the active/available Drugs tied to that Orderable Item are 
 in that multiple.
 The problem scenario occurs if drugs are entered in that multiple, then 
 all those drugs subsequently deleted. This causes the Daily Dose Check to 
 not be executed.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routine PSSSCHMS to check for entries in the 
 DRUG(S) FOR DOSING CHK FREQ (#11.1) sub file, rather than just checking 
 for a counter for that multiple.
  
  
 2)  INC1636522 - If an Old Schedule Name + PRN is used, the MOCHA dose
 check cannot be performed. 
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Per the Dosing Check user manual, if an order has a schedule with PRN 
 attached to it, it is supposed to strip off the PRN and then attempt to do
 the order check. If an Old Schedule Name is used, the order check can be
 performed. If PRN is appended to the Old Schedule Name, it cannot perform
 the order check.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routine PSSDSUTL to enable the PRNSCHD 
 function to strip the PRN designation off both Schedule Names and Old 
 Schedule Names. A modification was also made to PSSDSAPI to add the Old 
 Schedule Name(s) translation to the Dose Check logic.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 No options need to be disabled.  It is best to install this patch during
 non-peak hours.
  
 This patch should take less than 2 minutes to install.
  
  
 1.     Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.     Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
 3.     From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
        the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
        following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the
        patch PSS*1.0*231.
  
   a.   Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
   b.   Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
        is installed.  It compares all components of this patch routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.
  
   c.   Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
  
 4.     From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option 
        and choose the patch to install.
  
 5.     When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
        NO//'
  
 6.     When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? NO//'
  
 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;1.0;PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT;**[PATCH LIST]**;[DATE];[BUILD NUMBER]
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed-up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSS Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSS*1.0*231 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSS*1.0*231 in
 the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;1.0;PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT;**[Patch List]**;9/30/97;Build 4

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.

Routine Name: PSSDSUTL
