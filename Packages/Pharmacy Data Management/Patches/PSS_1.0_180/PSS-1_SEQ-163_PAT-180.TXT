 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s)
 ============================
 1) INC000000324382 - Drug Enter/Edit option
   
 Problem:
 --------
 The Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option deletes Possible Dosage 
 of an inactive drug if the user answers YES to the "Do you wish to 
 match/rematch to NATIONAL DRUG file?" prompt.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] VistA option will be modified 
 to prevent drugs with INACTIVE dates to be deleted and continue with the 
 normal prompts.
  
 Technical
 ==========
 ASK+3^PSSDEE routine will be modified to verify the drug is active
 and set PSINACT variable to 1 (inactive) if it is inactive.
 ASKND+5^PSSDEE will be modified to check to see if the PSINACT variable
 equals 1, the D EN1^PSSUTIL(DISPDRG,1) command is NOT executed.
  
 2) INC000000861438 - PSSIV ADD Input Template 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When editing an IV Additive, using both the Additives File and the 
 Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] options, the prompt for Additive 
 Frequency is missing.
 Currently the only way to edit the ADDITIVE FREQUENCY field (#18) within 
 the IV ADDITIVES file (#52.6) is through FileMan.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The PSSIV ADD Input Template will be modified to include the ADDITIVE 
 FREQUENCY field (#18) within the IV ADDITIVES file (#52.6).
  
 3) INC000000942809 - Message Sent field (#3) in the Vendor Interface
                      Data file (#59.74) not populating.
 Problem:
 --------
 A defect was discovered with the population of the MESSAGE SENT field
 (#3) of the VENDOR INTERFACE DATA #59.74).  When the Interface
 Scheduler [PSS INTERFACE SCHEDULER] option job receives an error
 indicating that the Vendor Database is down, it makes an entry in the
 VENDOR INTERFACE DATA file (#59.74) and sends a VistA MailMan message to
 the mail group PSS ORDER CHECKS. When the message is sent, the 
 MESSAGE SENT field(#3) is not being updated with the message sent
 flag.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 ^PSSHRIT routine will be modified to set the MESSAGE SENT field (#3)
 in the VENDOR INTERFACE DATA file (#59.74) after the Mailman message
 is sent.
