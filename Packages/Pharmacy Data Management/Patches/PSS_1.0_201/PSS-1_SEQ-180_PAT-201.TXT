Description:
============

 Pharmacy Data Management infrastructure to prepare for Daily Dose Check 
 implementation.
  
 MOCHA v2.1a will provide the following enhancements:
 ===================================================
  
 Add new fields to both the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) and the 
 MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file (#51) to define a frequency for a schedule or 
 medication instruction used within a medication order for specific 
 dispense drug(s) or for all drugs in order to perform a Max Daily Dose 
 Order Check.
  
 Add new fields to both the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) and the 
 MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file (#51) to be able to derive a frequency value 
 to perform a Max Daily Dose Order Check when the name of a schedule or 
 medication instruction has been changed.
  
 Modify the Input Transforms and Executable Help of the NAME field (#.01) 
 and SYNONYM field (.5) of the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file (#51) to 
 provide more informative information to the user when entering/editing 
 data.
  
 Modify Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option to allow editing 
 of the new frequency fields.
  
 Modify Administration Schedule File Report [PSS SCHEDULE REPORT] option 
 to display data entered in the frequency fields.
  
 Modify Medication Instruction File Add/Edit [PSSJU MI] option to allow 
 editing of the new frequency fields.
  
 Modify Medication Instruction File Report [PSS MED INSTRUCTION REPORT] 
 option to display data entered in the new frequency fields.
  
 Modify entries to the DOSE UNITS file (#51.24).
  
 Create a new file called DOSE UNIT CONVERSION (#51.25).
  
 Add new entries to the APSP INTERVENTION TYPE file (#9009032.3).
  
 Enhance the interpretation of free text dosages when deriving a numeric 
 dose and dose unit for the Dosing Check when the free text dosage contains
 a dosing range.
  
 Enhance the interpretation of free text dosages when deriving a numeric 
 dose and dose unit for the Dosing Check when the free text dosage contains
 data within parenthesis.
   
 An enhancement has been made when a medication order is placed in
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), when a free text dosage is
 entered, and there is a many to one match from Drug to Pharmacy Orderable
 Item. If the DRUG File (#50) entry selected to be used for the Dosing
 check is a multi-ingredient, and every ingredient has a Drug Unit, and
 that Drug Unit resolves to a non Dose-Form type of Unit in the DOSE UNITS
 File (#51.24), and a numeric dose and dose unit was derived from the free
 text dosage, and that derived dose unit resolves to the same unit as the
 ingredient drug units, then the Dosing check will be performed using that
 numeric dose and dose unit.
  
 Changes have been made to the VistA XML parsing code for the DOSING_INFO 
 and DRUG_INFO Web Services to properly interpret all attributes returned 
 with Mocha Server 3.0 and future server versions. These changes are 
 transparent to the end user.
  
  
 The following options have been changed:
 =======================================
  
 The Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option has been modified 
 to allow editing of the DOSING CHECK FREQUENCY field (#11), DRUG(S) FOR 
 DOSING CHK FREQ (#11.1), and OLD SCHEDULE NAME(S) field (#13) for a 
 schedule.
  
 The Administration Schedule File Report [PSS SCHEDULE REPORT] option has 
 been modified to allow display of the DOSING CHECK FREQUENCY field (#11), 
 DRUG(S) FOR DOSING CHK FREQ (#11.1), and OLD SCHEDULE NAME(S) field (#13) 
 from the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) for a schedule.
  
 The Medication Instruction File Add/Edit [PSSJU MI] option has been 
 modified to allow editing of the DOSING CHECK FREQUENCY field (#32), 
 DRUG(S) FOR DOSING CHK FREQ field (#32.1), and OLD MED INSTRUCTION 
 NAME(S) field (#33) for a medication instruction. 
  
 The Medication Instruction File Report [PSS MED INSTRUCTION REPORT] 
 option has been modified to allow display of the DOSING CHECK FREQUENCY 
 field (#32), DRUG(S) FOR DOSING CHK FREQ (#32.1), and OLD MED INSTRUCTION 
 NAME(S) field (#33) from the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file (#51) for a 
 medication instruction.
  
  
 The following file has been added:
 =================================
  
 A new DOSE UNIT CONVERSION file (#51.25) was created. Although this file 
 has not yet been standardized by STS, no local editing will be allowed. 
 The Read Access of the DOSE UNIT CONVERSION file (#51.25) has been set to 
 "Pp." The DOSE UNIT CONVERSION file will be used to convert one dose unit 
 to another using a conversion factor so that a comparison can be made 
 between two dose units when they are not equivalent.  The dose unit used 
 for the Dosing Order Check may not be the same dose unit First Data Bank 
 (FDB) returns with the Dosing Order Check results. The initial list of 
 Dose Unit Conversion entries is provided in Appendix D of the Dosing 
 Order Check User Manual.
    
  
 The following fields have been modified:
 =======================================
 The NAME field (.01) of the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file (#51) is being
 modified, specifically the Input Transform and Executable Help.
  
 The SYNONYM field (.5) of the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file (#51) is being 
 modified, specifically the Input Transform and Executable Help.
  
  
 The following fields have been added to existing files:
 ======================================================
  
 The DOSING CHECK FREQUENCY field (#11) has been created in the 
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1). This field allows a user to enter a 
 specific format pattern to represent the frequency such as 'X#D', where 
 '#' represents a 1-2 character numeric value.  The DOSING CHECK FREQUENCY 
 field takes priority over all other fields/values when determining 
 frequency for the Max Daily Dose Order Check.
  
 The DRUG(S) FOR DOSING CHK FREQ field (#11.1) has been created in 
 the ADMNISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1). This multiple field allows for 
 dispense drugs from the DRUG file (#50) to be associated with the DOSING 
 CHECK FREQUENCY field (#11) value within the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file 
 (#51.1).  
  
 The OLD SCHEDULE NAME(S) field (#13) has been created in the 
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1). This multiple field stores the old 
 values of the schedule when the NAME field (#.01) is edited. Values can 
 also be added to this field directly.
  
 The DOSING CHECK FREQUENCY field (#32) has been created in the MEDICATION 
 INSTRUCTION file (#51). This field allows a user to enter a specific 
 format pattern to represent the frequency such as 'X#D', where '#' 
 represents a 1-2 character numeric value.  The DOSING CHECK FREQUENCY 
 field takes priority over all other fields/values in this file when
 determining frequency for the Max Daily Dose Order Check.
  
 The DRUG(S) FOR DOSING CHK FREQ field (#32.1) has been created in 
 the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file (#51). This multiple field allows for 
 dispense drugs from the DRUG file (#50) to be associated with the DOSING 
 CHECK FREQUENCY field (#32) value within the MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file 
 (#51).  
  
 The OLD MED INSTRUCTION NAME(S) field (#33) has been created in the 
 MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file (#51). This multiple field stores the old 
 values of the medication instruction when the NAME field (#.01) is 
 edited. Values can also be added to this field directly.
  
  
 The following input templates have been modified:
 ================================================
  
 The PSSJ SCHEDULE EDIT Input template has been modified to allow editing 
 of DOSING CHECK FREQUENCY field (#11), DRUG(S) FOR DOSING CHK FREQ 
 (#11.1), and OLD SCHEDULE NAME(S) field (#13) in the ADMINISTRATION 
 SCHEDULE file (#51.1).
