  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Medication Order Check HealthCare Application (MOCHA) 2.1B patches 
 implement Max Daily Dose Order Checks for simple medication orders 
 entered through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), Inpatient 
 Medications and Outpatient Pharmacy. If the Daily Dose exceeds the First 
 Databank (FDB) recommended Max Daily Dose, a warning shall be displayed 
 to the user. If the Max Daily Dose Order Check cannot be performed, an 
 error message will be displayed to the user, along with general dosing 
 information for the drug in most cases.
  
 This patch is part of the MOCHA Enhancements 2.1B group of builds and must
 be the third of the group installed. Multiple package host files were
 created where possible to simplify installation at Veterans Health
 Administration (VHA) facilities for the other portions. The combined host
 file MOCHA_2_1_PSO_OR_PSJ.KID contains OR*3.0*382, PSJ*5.0*256 and
 PSO*7.0*402.  The combined follow up host file
 MOCHA_2_1_FOLLOW_UP_PSO_OR_PSJ.KID contains PSO*7.0*500, PSJ*5.0*347 and
 OR*3.0*469.  In addition, there is another standalone Pharmacy Data 
 Management patch, PSS*1.0*178, which must be installed in conjunction with
 the other builds.
  
                               * * * Notice * * *
                   This group of patches should not be installed 
                       until the follow on patch PSO*7.0*515
            has been released and is ready to be immediately installed. 
                PSO*7.0*515 must be installed immediately after the
                  successful installation of this group of builds.
               See the PSO*7.0*515 patch description for details.

 ****************************** NOTE ************************************
 The 'Before' checksum values for ALL routines in this patch will appear
 incorrect.  This is because they are components of the preceding patch
 PSS*1.0*178 which is also part of the MOCHA 2.1B group of builds.  The
 FORUM Patch Module uses released checksum values to populate the 
 'Before' fields below.  Since PSS*1.0*178 will be released at the same
 time as this patch the FORUM Patch Module does not have access to the
 actual 'Before' checksum values.
