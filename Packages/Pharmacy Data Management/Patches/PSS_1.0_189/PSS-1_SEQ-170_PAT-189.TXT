Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Pharmacy Safety Updates project which was 
 established to address specific New Service Requests (NSRs) as well as
 Remedy Ticket(s) and a Patient Safety Issue (PSI) related to the VistA
 Pharmacy applications as approved by the Health Systems Enterprise Systems
 Manager(ESM).
  
 This project is comprised of patches from five different applications, as
 shown below:
   
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT (PDM) V. 1.0                PSS*1*189
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*444
    INPATIENT MEDICATIONS (IM) V.5.0                     PSJ*5*313
    NATIONAL DRUG FILE (NDF) V. 4.0                      PSN*4*429
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*545
  
 The following New service Requests (NSRs) are being addressed by this patch:
  
  NSRs 20060601/20111206 Allow Dispensing of Greater Than 90 Day Supply
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Outpatient Pharmacy and supporting VistA applications are being modified
  to allow dispensing of more than 90 day supply fill for outpatient 
  prescriptions. The new limit will be 365 days and will be set for each drug
  individually. See below for more information on specific menu 
  options related to this enhancement.  
  
  NSR 20110308 Addition of a STRENGTH Property to IV ADDITIVES and Premixed 
               IV SOLUTIONS
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Although patches PSJ*5*289 and PSS*1*174 introduced quite a few enhancements
  to the IV Additives and IV Solutions ordering functionality they did not go
  far enough in addressing all the issues originally in the NSR. Patches 
  PSJ*5*313 and PSS*1*189 will extend the display of the IV Additive strength
  to other parts of the Inpatient Medications and Pharmacy Data Management 
  applications. In addition, it will also impose a new rule where an Orderable
  Item can only have one IV Solution for a specific volume when it is marked
  to be used in the CPRS IV Fluid Order Entry. 
   
  NSR 20080907 Inactivate Pharmacy Standard Schedule
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This enhancement is a conversion of an existing Class III software solution
  that permits an entry in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) to be 
  marked as INACTIVE via the Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option.
  Once marked INACTIVE the schedule is no longer shown on the CPRS 
  ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE list.
  
   
 The following Pharmacy Data Management functionality was modified:
    
 1. New MAXIMUM DAYS SUPPLY field (#66) in the DRUG file (#50)
    This new field shown below was added to the DRUG file (#50) for storing
    the local maximum day supply value for a medication in an outpatient 
    prescription.
  
    Field Name: MAXIMUM DAYS SUPPLY   Format: Numeric
  
    INPUT TRANSFORM: D MXDAYSUP^PSSDDUT2
    HELP-PROMPT:     This is the maximum number of days supply for this drug. 
                     Enter ?? for important information regarding default
                     values and copays.
  
    DESCRIPTION:     This field is used to determine the maximum number for
                     days supply that may be assigned to this drug. If this
                     field is left blank, the MAXIMUM DAYS SUPPLY is set to
                     a default of 90 unless the drug is a controlled 
                     substance or Clozapine. Any value greater than 90
                     increases the number of potential copay units above 3.
  
                     The maximum value allowed for this field is 365 (days)
                     for most drugs, however:
  
                     - Schedule 2 controlled substances have a 30-day maximum
                       days supply limit
  
                     - Schedules 3 thru 5 controlled substances have a 90-day
                       maximum days supply limit 
  
                     - The maximum number of days supply for this drug cannot
                       exceed the National Drug File (NDF) maximum value if it
                       exists
  
                     - No value can be entered for Clozapine drugs as the
                       maximum days supply is controlled by the Clozapine
                       functionality
  
 2. ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1)
    a) A new field named INACTIVE (#12) shown below was added to the 
       ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) to allow the filtering inactive
       schedules when providing a list to the CPRS application.
  
       Field Name: INACTIVE      Format: Set of Codes ('1' FOR YES)
  
       HELP-PROMPT:    Answer YES to mark this administration schedule entry
                       as inactive. 
       DESCRIPTION:    This field is used to indicate that a Standard Schedule
                       is inactive. Inactive schedules are filtered from the
                       list of schedules sent to CPRS for selection when users
                       are placing a medication order.  
  
    b) The upper limit for the FREQUENCY (IN MINUTES) field (#2) was increased
       from 129,600 (90 days) to 525,600 (365 days).
   
 3. MEDICATION INSTRUCTION file (#51)
    The upper limit for the FREQUENCY (IN MINUTES) field (#31) was increased
    from 129,600 (90 days) to 525,600 (365 days).
   
 4. IV SOLUTIONS file (#52.7)
    New INPUT TRANSFORMS have been added to the VOLUME (#2) and USED IN IV
    FLUID ORDER ENTRY (#17) to enforce the following new rule introduced 
    relating to this file: 
   
    Rule: An Orderable Item can have only ONE IV solution with a specific
          volume when it is marked to be used in the IV Order Dialog.
  
 5. PSSCOMMON input template
    The PSSCOMMON input template used by the Drug File Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG
    ENTER/EDIT] option was modified to include the new MAXIMUM
    DAYS SUPPLY field (#66) in the DRUG file (#50) so that it can be edited
    along with the other fields in this option.
  
 6. PSSJ SCHEDULE EDIT Input template
    The PSSJ SCHEDULE EDIT input template used by the Standard Schedule 
    Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option was modified to include the new INACTIVE
    field (#12) in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) so that it can
    be edited along with the other fields in this option.
  
 7. Edit Orderable Items [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS] option 
    This option was modified to display the IV Additive Strength value as
    seen below:
  
    ... 
       Orderable Item ->  PIPERACILLIN/TAZOBACTAM
       Dosage Form    ->  INJ
  
    Dispense Drugs:
    ---------------
    PIPERACILLIN 3/TAZOBACTAM 0.375GM/VI INJ
    PIPERACILLIN 2/TAZOBACTAM 0.25GM/VI INJ
    PIPERACILLIN 4/TAZOBACTAM 0.5GM/VI INJ
    PIPERACILLIN/TAZOBACTAM         (A)     Additive Strength: 3.375 GM 
    PIPERACILLIN/TAZOBACTAM         (A)     Additive Strength: 2.25 GM 
    PIPERACILLIN/TAZOBACTAM         (A)     Additive Strength: 4.5 GM 
   ...
  
 8. Primary Solution File (IV) [PSSJI SOLN] option
    This option was modified to enforce a new rule introduced to ensure that
    an Orderable Item can only have 1 active IV SOLUTION linked to it with a
    specific VOLUME when the IV SOLUTION is marked YES for the USED IN IV
    FLUID ORDER ENTRY field (#17). When they user tries to perform an edit
    that breaks this rule by editing the screen fields VOLUME, USED IN IV
    FLUID ORDER ENTRY or INACTIVATION DATE, the error message below will be
    displayed and the editing won't be permitted.
   
          Only one Active IV Solution with a specific volume can be linked to
          an Orderable Item or Dispense Drug when the IV Solution is marked to
          be used in the CPRS IV Fluid Order Entry.
  
 9. Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option 
    a) This option was modified to allow entry of the new MAXIMUM DAY SUPPLY
     
    ...
    NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT: EACH// 
    NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER: 1// 
    MAXIMUM DAYS SUPPLY: ??
      This field is used to determine the maximum number for days supply that
      may be assigned to this drug. The maximum value allowed for this field
      is 365 (days) for most drugs, however: 
        
        - Schedule 2 controlled substances have a 30-day maximum days supply 
          limit 
        - Schedules 3 thru 5 controlled substances have a 90-day maximum days
          supply limit 
        - The maximum number of days supply for this drug cannot exceed the
          National Drug File (NDF) maximum value if it exists
        - No value can be entered for Clozapine drugs as the maximum days
          supply is controlled by the Clozapine functionality
    
    MAXIMUM DAYS SUPPLY: 
    PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT: 0.8280
    ...
  
    b) The exact same change described above in #8 was applied to this option
       where the user can create, edit and link IV Solution entries to a 
       dispense drug.
        
 10. Lookup into Dispense Drug File [PSS LOOK] option
    This option was modified to display the new MAXIMUM DAYS SUPPLY (#66)
    field in the DRUG file (#50) along with the other dispense drug fields for
    the dispense drug selected, as shown below:
  
     ...
     DISPENSE UNIT:                       VA DISPENSE UNIT:          CAP
     DISPENSE UNITS/ORDER UNIT: 20        PRICE/DISPENSE UNIT:    0.8280
     NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT: EACH            NCPDP QUANTITY MULTIPLIER:  1.000
     MAXIMUM DAYS SUPPLY: 100
     APPL PKG USE:  Outpatient  Unit Dose  Non-VA Med
     STRENGTH: 10                       UNIT: MG
     POSSIBLE DOSAGES:
     ... 
  
 11. Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option
    This option was modified to add the new INACTIVE field (#12) in the 
    ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) to be updated for a schedule.
     
    ...
    OTHER LANGUAGE EXPANSION: 
    INACTIVE: ??
      This field is used to indicate that a Standard Schedule is inactive.
      Inactive schedules are filtered from the list of schedules sent to CPRS
      for selection when users are placing a medication order.
       
         Choose from: 
           1        YES
    INACTIVE: 
    ...
  
 12. Administration Schedule File Report [PSS SCHEDULE REPORT] option
     This option was modified to display the new INACTIVE field (#12)
     created in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) as seen below:
  
       ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE FILE REPORT (All)                     PAGE: NN

                                 INACTIVE: YES
      ...
   
 13. Dispense Drug/Orderable Item Maintenance [PSS MAINTAIN ORDERABLE ITEMS] &
     Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] options
     A new rule described below is being introduced which is related to the
     relationship between IV Solutions and Orderable Items.
   
     Rule: An Orderable Item can only have ONE IV solution with a specific
           volume when it is marked to be used in the CPRS IV Order Dialog.
  
     This option was modified to check every time the user tries to link a 
     dispense drug to an orderable item whether the new rule is being broken
     or not. If the new rule is being broken the message below will be
     displayed and the user will not be able to proceed with linking the drug
     to the orderable item.
   
        Matching [Dispense Drug Name]  to [Orderable Item Name] would cause
        the orderable item to have more than one Active IV Solution with the
        same volume marked to be used in the IV FLUID ORDER ENTRY, which is
        not allowed.
   
        Please, review the IV Solutions associated with this drug before
        matching it to this orderable item or match it to a different 
        orderable item.
   
 14. IV Solution Pre-Install Manual Clean-up (Environment Check routine)
     An environment check routine will run before the patch is installed to
     ensure that an orderable item does not have more than one IV Solution
     with the same volume when they are marked YES to be used in the CPRS IV
     Fluid Order Entry. If at least one orderable item entry is found, the
     patch installation will be aborted and a Mailman message will be sent
     to all users holding the following security keys: PSIVMGR, PSJI MGR, 
     PSNMGR.
  
     The message will contain a list of all orderable items that need to be 
     cleaned up, as seen in the sample message below:
    
     Subj: Duplicate IV Solution Volume under same Orderable Item  [#215733]
     From: PATCH PSS*1*189  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The list below shows IV Solutions in your database that need to be
     cleaned up before patch PSS*1*189 can be installed.
  
     Rule: An Orderable Item can only have ONE IV solution with a specific
           volume when it is marked to be used in the IV Order Dialog.

          5% DEXTROSE (1)
  
 15. IV Solution Post-Install Automatic Clean-up (Post-install routine)
     IV Solutions that are no longer used, meaning that either the IV
     Solution and/or the Dispense Drug and/or the Orderable Item are marked
     INACTIVE will have the field USED IN IV FLUID ORDER ENTRY set to 'NO'.
     A list of such IV Solutions will be sent to all users holding the
     following security keys: PSIVMGR, PSJI MGR, PSNMGR. The message will
     contain a list of all IV Solutions that have been automatically updated
     as seen in the sample message below:
  
     Subj: Auto-update of the IV Solution file  [#216328] 08/18/15@09:58 
     From: PATCH PSS*1*189  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The list below shows IV Solutions in your database that had the field
     USED IN IV FLUID ORDER ENTRY set to 'NO' because either the Orderable
     Item, the Dispense Drug or the IV Solution itself was marked INACTIVE.

 16. New API for CPRS: $$MAXDS^PSSUTIL1
     This new API was created for CPRS to retrieve the Maximum Days Supply
     value for a specific medication. This API is available to CPRS through
     the Integration Control Registration (ICR) #3239. Below is a detailed 
     description of the API.
  
        $$MAXDS^PSSUTIL1(INPUT)
        This API accepts an array containing the Pharmacy Orderable Item
        (required) and Dispense Drug (optional) and returns the maximum number
        of Days Supply allowed to be dispensed for the specific medication.
   
        Parameters:
        Input:  INPUT("PSOI") (Required)
                Pointer to the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7). 
  
                INPUT("DRUG") (Optional)
                Pointer to the DRUG file (#50). This parameter is optional.
                If not passed, the API will return the highest value from all
                the dispense drugs linked to the Pharmacy Orderable Item.      
     
        Output $$MAXDS
               Maximum number of days supply that can be dispensed for the
               orderable item and/or dispense drug.
  
 17. IV Additives and Solutions - Display "INACTIVATION DATE"
  
     The INACTIVATION DATE will display whenever a VistA lookup is done on
     IV Additives and Solutions.
  
     This was accomplished by making the following two fields identifiers: 
  
     FIELD NAME           FIELD NUMBER     FILE NAME/NUMBER
     ----------------------------------------------------------
     INACTIVATION DATE         12          IV ADDITIVES (#52.6)
     INACTIVATION DATE          8          IV SOLUTIONS (#52.7)
  
  
     Note: The following 'HELP'-PROMPT text will display for fields 8 &12
           "Enter the date this drug was inactivated."

 Patch Installation: 
  
 Pre Installation Overview
 -------------------------
 This project is comprised of patches from five different applications as 
 listed here.  The patches will get released together and the suggested 
 installation order is as shown.  
  
 An installation guide released with patch PSS*1*189, discusses the 
 installation process as PSS*1*189 is the patch that must be installed 
 first.
  
  APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT (PDM) V. 1.0                PSS*1*189
  OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*444
  INPATIENT MEDICATIONS (IM) V.5.0                     PSJ*5*313
  NATIONAL DRUG FILE (NDF) V. 4.0                      PSN*4*429
  INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*545
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Item #14 above describes in detail the pre-installation requirement for 
 installing this patch. In summary, the process is required because a new rule
 will be introduced by this patch that will enforce the following:
  
 An Orderable Item can only have ONE IV solution with a specific volume when
 it is marked to be used in the IV Order Dialog.
  
 ***Please note****
  
 The pre-installation environment check routine will only execute in 
 production environments. 
  
  
 Post Installation Overview
 --------------------------
 Item #15 above describes in detail the post-installation process for 
 automatically setting the USED IN IV FLUID ORDER ENTRY field (#17) in the
 IV SOLUTIONS file (#52.7) to 'NO' for inactive entries. This will prevent
 inactive entries from being made active again and breaking the rule 
 described above.
     
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 Although this installation will take no longer than 3 minutes, it is 
 recommended that it be installed overnight to prevent any disruption of 
 service to other users.
  
  
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
       When loading the distribution, the following text will display:
       "Will first run the Environment Check Routine, PSS189EN"
  
  
    2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System (KIDS) menu,
       select the Installation menu.
  
    3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*189).
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         back up any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
      d. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
   4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*189.
  
   5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//"
      respond NO.
  
   6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
