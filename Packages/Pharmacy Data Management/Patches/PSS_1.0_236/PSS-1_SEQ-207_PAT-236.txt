Subject: PSSPRICE ERRORS IN TRACKER MESSAGE, PADE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
  
 1) When using option PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT to populate field #13 PRICE PER 
 ORDER UNIT, a background job is triggered that causes a hard error 
 <SUBSCRIPT>HIS+8^PSSPRICE.
  
 2) Patch PSS*1*227 introduced a bulletin named the Pharmacy Price Tracker
 which is sent whenever a drug's PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT value is added or
 changed. However, when a user edits both the values of the PRICE PER ORDER
 UNIT and the DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT, using option PSS DRUG 
 ENTER/EDIT, this bulletin is not being created.
  
 3) When using option PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT to populate field #13 PRICE PER 
 ORDER UNIT or #15 DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT, a background job is 
 triggered that send a price tracker message. The price tracker message is 
 being enhanced to display which field was edited.
  
 4) Pharmacy PADE issues.
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1) INC4679742 - PSSPRICE error if all entries deleted
 2) INC2333383 - Pharmacy Price Tracker bulletin not being created
 3) INC6753074 - PSSPRICE does not report which price component changed
 4) INC4556579 - Pharmacy PADE issue 
  
  
 1) INC4679742 - PSSPRICE error if all entries deleted
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using option PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT and populating field #13 PRICE PER 
 ORDER UNIT, a cross reference on that field triggers background job 
 HIS^PSSPRICE. This job does the following: 
  
 - Purges entries in the file #50 field #50.095 DT/TM DISP UNIT PRICE
   CHANGED multiple 
 - Adds a new entry to the multiple 
 - Sends a "Pharmacy Price Tracker" email 
  
 Parameter PSS DRUG AUDIT RETENTION MOS determines the date range of 
 entries to purge. If the purge causes all the entries in the multiple to 
 be deleted, then a hard error <SUBSCRIPT>HIS+8^PSSPRICE occurs. This 
 error also has the side effects of not adding a new entry to the field 
 #50.095 DT/TM DISP UNIT PRICE CHANGED multiple and not sending the 
 "Pharmacy Price Tracker" email.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine PSSPRICE was modified to exit normally if there are no more
 entries to evaluate. Exiting this loop in a controlled manner adds the new
 entry for the current price change and restores the "Pharmacy Price
 Tracker " email.
  
  
 2) INC2333383 - Pharmacy Price Tracker bulletin not being created
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Patch PSS*1*227 introduced a bulletin named the Pharmacy Price Tracker 
 which is sent whenever a drug's PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT value is added or
 changed. However, when a user edits both the values of the PRICE PER ORDER
 UNIT and the DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT, using option PSS DRUG
 ENTER/EDIT, this bulletin is not being created.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSSPRICE was modified to add a new cross reference (DUO) to the
 DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT field (#15) of the Drug file (#50) that is
 designed to create the Pharmacy Price Tracker bulletin when a new value is
 entered into this field. Also modified the routine PSSPRICE by adding a
 timestamp to the Pharmacy Price Tracker bulletin.
  
  
 3) INC6753074 - PSSPRICE does not report which price component changed
  
 Problem:
 --------
 During testing of PSS*1*236 it was determined that the Pharmacy Price 
 Tracker bulletin messages generated during testing were vague. The user 
 requested additional wording be added to the messages to clarify what 
 changes were being made to the prices in #50, Drug file.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The Pharmacy Tracker email message that is sent when there is a change to 
 file #50, field #16 PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT was corrected to report which 
 component of the price per dispense unit changed. It can be a change to 
 field #13, PRICE PER ORDER UNIT or a change to field #15, DISPENSE UNITS 
 PER ORDER UNIT.
  
  
 4) INC4556579 - Pharmacy PADE issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 It was reported that while defining a new drug using the PSS DRUG 
 ENTER/EDIT [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT] option with the following conditions:
  
  - The drug is marked for Unit Dosage or IV packages
  - The user enters data for the PRICE PER ORDER UNIT field (#13)
  - The Pharmacy Automated Dispensing Equipment (PADE) is flagged to 
    send "NEW DRUGS"
  
 The user will not get prompted "Would you like to send this new drug to 
 PADE?" and the new drug information will not be sent to PADE.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSSPRICE was modified so the patch fixes the issue by renewing the
 PSSNEW variable which was overwritten while editing the PRICE PER ORDER
 UNIT field (#13) of the DRUG file (#50).

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 -------------------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed-up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 Validation of Back Out Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSS Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSS*1.0*236 patch have been backed out, the first two lines of the
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSS*1.0*236 in
 the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;1.0;PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT;**[Patch List]**;2/28/17;Build 6

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.
