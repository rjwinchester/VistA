Description:
============

 Patch PSS*1.0*225 adds the new RESPIRATORY THERAPY DRUG? field (#15) to 
 the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) to store the classification of 
 drugs for use in Respiratory Therapy. The patch modifies the Edit 
 Orderable Items [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS] option in the Orderable Item 
 Management [PSS ORDERABLE ITEM MANAGEMENT] menu to include a prompt for 
 users to designate an orderable item as a Respiratory Therapy Drug. This 
 classification is used to identify which medications and patients are 
 included in the Respiratory Therapy Medications report in the Bar Code
 Medication Administration (BCMA) package.

 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of this patch, it is not recommended for
 backout, and a restore from a backup of the Transport Global should not be
 attempted. However, in the event that a site decides to back out this 
 patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit a
 help desk ticket. The development team will need to issue one or more
 follow-on patches in order to comprehensively back out this patch, after
 coordination with the VA Project Manager and COR.  
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the PSS routine contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the PSS routine has been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routine will no longer contain 
 the designation of patch PSS*1.0*225 on line 2 in the patch list section. 
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out; it does not confirm that other patch component changes 
 have been backed out.
