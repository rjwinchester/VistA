Subject: SCRIPTALK ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch introduces data dictionary changes necessary to support the
 enhancements to the ScripTalk 'talking' prescription label functionality
 being introduced by patch PSO*7*502. The current ScripTalk label, released
 in 2003, has a 2K memory capacity, which limits the amount of prescription
 data that can be audibly read to the blind or low-vision Veteran using the
 system. New ScripTalk labels with 10K capacity are now available, and this
 patch takes advantage of that capacity by sending more prescription data,
 including Drug Warnings, to the ScripTalk label.
  
 The data sent to the ScripTalk label (either 2K or 10K), will now be 
 controlled by one of two new parameters, depending on how your ScripTalk
 device definitions are set up. If they are set up at the system level
 using a mapped device, the dataset will be controlled by the new SCPIPTALK
 PRINTER TYPE SubField (#.03) in the SCRIPTALK PRINT DEVICE MAPPING SubFile
 (#59.747) of the PHARMACY SYSTEM File (#59.7), which this patch 
 introduces. If your ScripTalk device definition is set at the Outpatient
 Site level,the dataset will be controlled by the new SCRIPTRALK PRINTER
 TYPE Field (#107.2) in the OUTPATIENT SITE File (#59), which will be 
 introduced by patch PSO*7.0*502. Neither of these new fields will be
 populated upon patch install, and the software assumes a 2k dataset when
 either parameter is null.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 Patch PSS*1.0*217 is a required patch for PSO*7.0*502.  Please install 
 PSS*1.0*217 prior to installing PSO*7.0*502.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 N/A 
  
 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------- 
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes and users can be on the system.
  
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
    2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
       the Installation menu.
  
    3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1*217)
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1*217.
  
    5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       NO//" respond NO.
  
    6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 If you have a 10k printer currently installed on your system, you must 
 change the ScripTalk device setup to indicate it is 10k. Otherwise, you 
 will only get the 2k output. Additional information is included in the 
 release notes as well as the technical manual.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the ScripTalk functionality.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 Data dictionary changes were included with this patch. However, those 
 changes were to add additional fields. At this time, it is not necessary 
 to rollback these changes.

Routine Information:
====================
No routines included.
