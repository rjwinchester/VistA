    Problem:
    --------
    Patch PSS*1*127 incorrectly populated the NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT field
    (#82) of the DRUG file (#50) entry matched to VA PRODUCT file (#50.68)
    entry "MEMANTINE HCL 5MG/10MG TAB TITRATION PAK,49" (internal entry
    number 16512) as "RA" instead of "EA". "RA" is an invalid value.  "EA"
    corresponds to "EACH".  As per CDW data, this incorrect data exists at
    thirty-six medical centers as well as many additional test and gold
    databases. (The root cause of the issue in PSS*1*127 was due to a typo 
    in a temporary file entry for "MEMANTINE HCL". Drugs matched to other 
    VA Product entries were not affected.)
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Post-install routine PSSP198 searches the DRUG file (#50) for drugs
    that are associated with the corresponding VA PRODUCT file (#50.68)
    entry "MEMANTINE HCL 5MG/10MG TAB TITRATION PAK;49" and then checks the
    NCPDP DISPENSE UNIT field (#3) for a value of "RA".  If NCPDP DISPENSE
    UNIT field (#3) is set to "RA", it will be reset to "EA".  Also, a 
    MailMan message will be generated identifying which drugs were updated
    (if any) and sent to all users who hold the PSNMGR security key as 
    well as the user installing the patch.  See end of this section for
    the MailMan message example.
  
    Routine: PSSP198
  
  
 2. I9845626FY16 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When invoking the Dispense Drug/Orderable Item Maintenance [PSS
    MAINTAIN ORDERABLE ITEMS] and Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT]
    options, several issues concerning the "INACTIVE DATE:" prompt may
    occur.  Those issues include an incorrect default INACTIVE DATE and the
    inability to delete, add, or change the INACTIVE DATE when necessary.  
    The user is often unaware that the deletion, addition, or change was
    not filed.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSSPOIM1 has been modified to display the correct default value
    for the "INACTIVE DATE:" prompt and allow the user to delete, add, or 
    change the INACTIVE DATE.  If a deletion or change should not be
    allowed because of the corresponding inactive dates in the DRUG file
    (#50), the user is informed with a message.  The corresponding field 
    display in [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS] is not resolved at this time and
    will be addressed by a future patch.
  
  
    Routine: PSSPOIM1
  
  
 3. I6659751FY16
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A problem occurs with Dosing checks in Outpatient Pharmacy, Inpatient 
    Medications, and Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) when the
    Dose Unit of APPLICATORFUL(S) or SUPPOSITOR(IES) is the Dose Unit of
    the medication order. In these cases, the FIRST DATABANK DOSE UNIT of
    APPLICATORFUL/S or SUPPOSITORY/IES is sent into the Medication Order 
    Check Healthcare Application (MOCHA) interface as the Dose Unit and
    then a Dosing Error is displayed to the user.  The "/" character causes
    this problem. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Post-install routine PSSP198 will correct the entries in the DOSE UNIT
    (#51.24) file as described below:
  
    1. Modify FIRST DATABANK DOSE UNIT field value for APPLICATORFUL(S) 
       entry from 'APPLICATORFUL/S' to 'APPLICATORFUL'.
  
    2. Modify FIRST DATABANK DOSE UNIT field value for SUPPOSITOR(IES) 
       entry from 'SUPPOSITORY/IES' to 'SUPPOSITORY'.
  
    3. Add 'SUPPOSITORY/IES' to the list of SYNONYMS for SUPPOSITOR(IES) 
       entry.
  
  
    A MailMan message will be sent to the holders of the PSNMGR security
    key as well as the user installing the patch, containing an 
    informational statement regarding these updates.  See example MailMan 
    message below.
