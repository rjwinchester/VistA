 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. I14314595FY17 New: GET1+1^ORWORR1 *ORLIST (Shift handoff tool errors) 
 Problem:
 -------
 This hard error [GET1+1^ORWORR1 *ORLIST] occurs if the Value "No Patients 
 Found^0^0^0^40" is passed into the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) "CRHD GET 
 LABS". How this occurs is that the RPC "CRHD HOT PATIENT LIST" returns
 "No Patients" in the incorrect piece of the return data if the HOT list 
 has no patients, then the user clicks the submit button.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified routine CRHD9 to return "No Patients" in the correct piece of 
 the return data
  
 2. I15927416FY17 New: Invalid Pointer when printing
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The invalid pointer error occurs when trying to print a patient or group
 of patients that were loaded via the Default Patient List selection. The
 patients will load fine but when trying to print or process a print
 preview. The GUI will error out. The cause for this was that the GUI was 
 trying to remove an object from memory that no longer existed. This 
 object was being cleared twice which caused the error on the second 
 attempt.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modifications have been made to prevent this improper cleanup. 
  
 3. I16011239FY17 New: The Nurse Shift Handoff Tool hangs when printing a 
 unit report.
                                                                 
 Problem:
 -------
 When trying to print a unit report, the Shift Handoff Tool hangs.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 It was identified that there were special characters being pasted into
 the custom fields which caused the GUI to go into a never ending loop.
 Filters have been put into place that will prevent this going forward 
 and also retroactively correct the problem. Text is now filtered when 
 loading, saving, and printing. This will ensure that these non-standard
 characters will not be present in the future as well as correcting any
 records where these may have been saved.
