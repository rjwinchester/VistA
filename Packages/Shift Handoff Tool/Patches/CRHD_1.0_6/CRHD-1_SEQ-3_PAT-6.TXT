Subject: SHIFT HANDOFF TOOL GUI 2FA IMPLEMENTATION

Category: 
  - Informational
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch will update the log in procedure to the Shift Handoff Tool GUI 
 to use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) which will require the use of a
 Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card.
  
 In order to make the transition to 2FA, it was also necessary to upgrade 
 the Shift Handoff Tool GUI to Delphi version XE8 to implement the new 
 Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker allowing compliance.
  
 CRHD*1.0*6 does not update any VistA routines but does update the Shift 
 Handoff Tool GUI.

 OVERVIEW:
 =========
  
   Problem: 
   --------
   The Department of Veterans Affairs Cybersecurity Task Force has been 
   tasked by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Inspector General
   (IG) to address identified material weaknesses. This task force has
   mandated that all internal, user facing VA applications become Two
   Factor Authentication (2FA) compliant by April 30, 2017.
  
   In order to be compliant, applications are required to authenticate
   users via Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards.
  
  
   Note: Usernames and password will no longer be permitted for employees
         and contractors to access VA applications.
  
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The Shift Handoff Tool has been upgraded to Delphi XE8 to allow access 
   to the latest version of the RPC Broker, implementing 2FA.
  
   The Shift Handoff Tool Release Notes and Shift Handoff Tool User Manual 
   have been updated to reflect this change.
