Description:
============

 This patch will install additional VistA code and menu options that

 System (NDFMS) monthly update functionality via the FORUM patch process.
  
 This patch is being released in conjunction with Pharmacy Data Management 
 patch PSS*1.0*195.
  
 Patch Components:
 -----------------
 Patch PSN*4*396 will provide the following enhancements:
  
 1.  The following fields have been added to the VA PRODUCT FILE (#50.68):
        HAZARDOUS TO HANDLE field (#101)
        HAZARDOUS TO DISPOSE field (#102)
        PRIMARY EPA CODE field (#103)
        WASTE SORT CODE field (#104)
        DOT SHIPPING CODE field (#105)
        FORMULARY DESIGNATOR field (#109)
        FORMULARY DESIGNATOR TEXT field (#110)
        CLINICAL EFFECTS OF DRUG multiple (#50.68108)
          PACKAGE field (#.01)
          OMIT EXP/DC ORDER CHECK field (#1)
          DURATION LIMIT field (#2)
  
  
    ** NOTE **
    Changes were made to display data for the new data dictionary (DD)
    fields added in this patch. The new fields will only display if
    information is defined. In this release, data will not be
    populated for the new fields except for a default value of NO for
    CLINICAL EFFECTS OF DRUG multiple (#50.68108).
  
    The areas affected in the options are product selection list and the
    body of the listing. The product selection list is where the product
    identifiers are normally displayed and the body of the listing is where
    the data displays for the fields.
  
 2. The Inquire to National Files [PSNACT] option has been modified to
    include the following fields from the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) when
    values are defined:
  
        HAZARDOUS TO HANDLE field (#101)
        HAZARDOUS TO DISPOSE field (#102)
        PRIMARY EPA CODE field (#103)
        WASTE SORT CODE field (#104)
        DOT SHIPPING CODE field (#105)
        FORMULARY DESIGNATOR field (#109)
        FORMULARY DESIGNATOR TEXT field (#110)
        CLINICAL EFFECT multiple (#50.68108)
          PACKAGE field (#.01)
          OMIT EXP/DC ORDER CHECK field (#1)
          DURATION LIMIT field (#2)
  
     Users will not see these fields populated or displayed as data will 
     not be present with patch PSN*4*396.
  
     When data is populated in a future patch, the hazardous waste group of
     fields will display after Maximum Days Supply. FORMULARY DESIGNATOR 
     field (#109) will display after NATIONAL FORMULARY INDICATOR and
     FORMULARY DESIGNATOR TEXT field (#110) will display as "Product Text"
     after NATIONAL FORMULARY RESTRICTION"
  
     The DURATION LIMIT field (#2) of the CLINICAL EFFECTS OF DRUG multiple
     (#50.68108) defines the time frame that expired and discontinued
     orders are omitted from Medication Order Check Application (MOCHA)
     enhanced order checking.  The default value of NO will be displayed
     after Override DF Exclude from Dosage Checks.

         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
    
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
