 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1.      INC000001003900 - Allergy package allows for assigning inactive 
 Drug Ingredients as Causative Agents 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When entering allergies for patients the software allows for assigning 
 inactive Drug Ingredients from the Drug Ingredients file (#50.416) as 
 Causative Agents. There are also patient allergies with some of these 
 inactive Drug Ingredients currently assigned as Causative Agents that 
 need to be corrected.
    
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modified routine PSNDI to filter out inactive Drug Ingredients when 
 returning data to the Adverse Reaction Tracking application for selection 
 as a causative agent. A report was created listing patients with inactive 
 Drug Ingredients currently assigned as Causative Agents that need to be 
 corrected (includes DFN and the inactive Drug Ingredient(s)). The report
 will be printed to the screen and emailed to the person installing the
 patch so it can be forwarded to the appropriate clinical staff. (Note the
 report includes only Drug Ingredients entered as the Causative Agent, only
 allergies that are not marked as entered in error, and only for patients
 not deceased). This patch does not correct the problem for adverse
 reactions entered through CPRS - a separate CPRS patch will be addressing
 this issue in that package.
