Description:
============

 IMPORTANT NOTE: As directed by the Secretary of the Department of Veterans
 Affairs, this patch is being released with a 24 hour compliance date for
 installation.
  
 This patch provides updates to data in several of the files associated 
 with the Patient Medication Instruction Sheet (PMI) portion of the
 National Drug File (NDF) application.  The seven files are:
    50.621        PMI-ENGLISH              
    50.622        PMI-SPANISH              
    50.623        PMI MAP-ENGLISH          
    50.624        PMI MAP-SPANISH          
    50.625        WARNING LABEL-ENGLISH    
    50.626        WARNING LABEL-SPANISH    
    50.627        WARNING LABEL MAP     
  
 The environment check routine for this patch checks to see that the 
 installer is a valid user.  The post-install routine for this patch
 deletes existing entries in these files, loads the new data, and rematches
 entries in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) to the proper PMIs.  The source of
 the data for the PMIs is First Data Bank.

 Users may remain on the system while this patch is installed.  
 Installation (excluding the time required to download the file to your
 system) takes less than ten minutes.  This patch should be installed
 during non-peak requirement hours.  The Print a PMI Sheet [PSNPMIS PRINT],
 Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS], Release
 Medication [PSO RELEASE], and Reprint an Outpatient Rx Label [PSO RXRPT]
