Description:
============

 NOTE: This patch is part of NDF Data Update FY18 #2, which is comprised
       of two patches, PSN*4*560 and PSN*4*561.
   
 This patch provides updates to data in several of the files associated 
 with the National Drug File (NDF) application.  This patch generates four
 mail messages.
  
 All are sent from NDF MANAGER to members of the NDF DATA mail group, 
 holders of the PSNMGR security key, and the person installing the patch.  
 The first message, with the subject DATA UPDATE FOR NDF, lists new
 products, CMOP ID (if one exists), dispense units, and associated NDCs,
 products for which the national formulary indicator has changed, products
 that have been unmatched from CMOP, products for which the national
 formulary restriction has changed, and products for which the copay tier 
 has changed. The second, with the subject UPDATED INTERACTIONS, lists
 interactions that have been added, edited, or inactivated. The third, with
 the subject DRUGS UNMATCHED FROM NATIONAL DRUG FILE, lists entries in the
 DRUG file (#50) which have been unmatched from NDF.  The fourth, with the
 subject INTERACTIONS and ALLERGIES UPDATED, lists interactions and
 allergies which have been changed because they were created with
 ingredients that are no longer primary ingredients.
  
                      **ATTENTION: CMOP SITES ONLY** 
  
 Do not load and install or queue to install this patch while Consolidated 
 Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) prescriptions are being transmitted. If
 transmissions are in progress, incorrect prescription information may be 
 sent to the CMOP. To determine if a CMOP transmission is in progress,
 examine TaskMan for jobs entitled "CMOP Data Transmission".

  ========== Installation Instructions and Software Retrieval ==========
  
 This patch can be obtained from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of
 the OI Field Offices. The preferred method is to retrieve the file using
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from DOWNLOAD.VISTA.DOMAIN.EXT, which
 will transmit the file from the first available server. Alternatively,
 sites may elect to retrieve the file from a specific OI Field Office.

 The software distribution includes: 
  
  FILE NAME               DESCRIPTION          FILE SIZE 
   
  NDF4P560.KID            KIDS Build           1099337 bytes
   
 National Drug File (NDF) and Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) users should 
 be off the system when this patch is installed.  Installation should take 
 15 minutes or less but will vary by account. This patch should be
 installed during non-peak requirement hours.
  
 The environment check routine for this patch checks that the installing 
 person is a valid user and that the patch has not been installed. If the 
 patch has previously been installed the installation will be aborted.
  
 1.  Retrieve the file NDF4P560.KID using one of the methods described 
     above.  
  
 2.  From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
     the Installation menu.  
  
 3.  From this menu, select the option Load a Distribution and select 
     NDF4P560.KID.  
  
 4.  From this menu, you may choose to use the option Verify Checksums in 
     Transport Global. When prompted, select PSN*4.0*560. All components of
     this patch are new, so the option Backup a Transport Global and the 
     option Compare Transport Global to Current System do not have to be 
     invoked.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select PSN*4.0*560.  
  
 6.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//" 
     respond NO.  
  
 7.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? NO//" respond NO.                      
  
 8.  Note: The environment check routine PSN560E and the post-install 
     routine PSN560D will be automatically deleted from your system upon 
     completion of the installation.
