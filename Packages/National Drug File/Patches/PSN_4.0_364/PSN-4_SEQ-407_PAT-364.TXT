Description:
============

 ******************************** ATTENTION *******************************
 FDA Medication Guide On- Demand and Automatic Printing functionality 
 includes 3 patches which must be installed in the following order:
  
 1.  PSS*1.0*177 - Vista patch that updates the Pharmacy System File (File 
     #59.7) FDA MED GUIDE SERVER URL field (Field #100) with the new secure
     CMOP SharePoint URL.
  
 2.  PSO*7.0*428 - Information only patch that contains instructions to 
     update the FDA Med Guide Automatic Printing Java Application Component
     installed on servers to work with the new secure CMOP SharePoint URL.
  
 3.  PSN*4.0*364 - Information only patch that contains instructions to 
     update the FDA Med Guide On-Demand Viewing Java Application Component
     installed on individual workstations to work with the new secure CMOP
     SharePoint URL.
  
 If your site is currently utilizing the FDA Med Guide Auto Printing or 
 On-Demand software, the updated Java Application Components included in
 this release, must be installed immediately following the installation of
 PSS*1.0*177.  Failure to do so will disable the FDA Med Guide On-Demand
 and Automatic printing functionality until the updated Java Application
 Component software is installed.
  
 ***If your site does not utilize the FDA Med Guide On-Demand or Auto 
    Printing software, you only need to install Vista patch PSS*1.0*177 
    and no further action on PSO*7*428 and PSN*4*364 is necessary.***"
  
 **************************************************************************
  
 On-Demand Viewing of FDA Med Guides were originally stored on an

 created and new and updated FDA Med guides are now added to the new 
 secure SharePoint.
  
 This patch will make updates to the FDA Medication Guides On-Demand 
 Viewing Java component for use with the new secured CMOP SharePoint.

 (On-Demand FDA Med Guides) and PSO*7*428 (Automatic FDA Med Guides) and
