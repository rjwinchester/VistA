Description:
============

 NOTE: This patch is part of NDF Data Update FY15 #4, which is comprised
 of two patches, PSN*4*424 and PSN*4*425.
  
 This patch provides updates to data in several of the files associated 
 with the National Drug File (NDF) application.  This patch generates four
 mail messages.
  
 All are sent from NDF MANAGER to members of the NDF DATA mail group, 
 holders of the PSNMGR security key, and the person installing the patch.  
 The first message, with the subject DATA UPDATE FOR NDF, lists new
 products, CMOP ID (if one exists), dispense units, and associated NDCs,
 products for which the national formulary indicator has changed, products
 that have been unmatched from CMOP, and products for which the national
 formulary restriction has changed.  The second, with the subject UPDATED
 INTERACTIONS, lists interactions that have been added, edited, or
 inactivated. The third, with the subject DRUGS UNMATCHED FROM NATIONAL
 DRUG FILE, lists entries in the DRUG file (#50) which have been unmatched
 from NDF.  The fourth, with the subject INTERACTIONS and ALLERGIES
 UPDATED, lists interactions and allergies which have been changed because
 they were created with ingredients that are no longer primary ingredients.
  
                      **ATTENTION: CMOP SITES ONLY** 
  
 Do not load and install or queue to install this patch while Consolidated 
 Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) prescriptions are being transmitted. If
 transmissions are in progress, incorrect prescription information may be 
 sent to the CMOP. To determine if a CMOP transmission is in progress,
 examine TaskMan for jobs entitled "CMOP Data Transmission".
