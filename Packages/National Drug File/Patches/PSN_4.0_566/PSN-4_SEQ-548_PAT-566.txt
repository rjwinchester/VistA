Subject: RE-INDEX OF CMOP ID FIELD/GCNSEQNO FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues.
  
 1. Unable to do remote order checks where the remote drug is now inactive 
    and the GCNSEQNO is blank.
  
 2. Drug File Index 'AQ1' Not Cleaned Up on Un-match from NDF 
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
  
 INC1229364 - Unable to do remote order checks where the remote drug is now
              inactive and the GCNSEQNO is blank
  
 INC2658350 - Drug File Index 'AQ1' Not Cleaned Up on Un-match from NDF
  
  
  
  
 1. INC1229364 - Unable to do remote order checks where the remote drug is 
                 now inactive and the GCNSEQNO is blank.
 Problem: 
 --------
 During the testing of PSN*4*565 patch and releasing of new .DAT file,
 additional entries of the VA product file (#50.68) updated with missing
 the GCNSEQNO field (#11). The GCNSEQNO field value is necessary for the
 system to perform enhanced order checks (MOCHA).
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch fixes the PPS-N data update process to prevent deletion of the 
 GCNSEQNO field (#11) of the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) for the products 
 that are not included in the .DAT file. 
  
 This patch restores the GCNSEQNO field for all products that were affected
 during the implementation of PSN*4*565 patch.
  
  
  
 2. INC2658350 - Drug File Index 'AQ1' Not Cleaned Up on Un-match from NDF
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Orlando VAMC identified several invalid index globals in the DRUG file 
 (#50) for the 'AQ1' cross-reference of CMOP ID field (#27).
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The NDF .DAT file update process has been updated to delete the 'AQ1'
 index entry for the un-matched drugs. Also, the 'AQ1' will be re-indexed 
 as part of the post-install routine.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:  
 ------------------------------- 
 The PSN566PO post-install process performs the following actions:
   - Restore the missing GCNSEQNO field (#11) of the VA PRODUCT file 
     (#50.68) for the provided products
   - Generates a MailMan message with all updated entries and it will be
     sent to the patch installer as well as all "PSNMGR" key holders.
   - Re-index the 'AQ1' index of CMOP ID field (#27) of the DRUG file (#50)
  
 The routines PSN566PO is deleted at the end of patch installation.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------ 
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 2

 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch should take less than 2 minutes to install.
  
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
    the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
    following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch
    PSN*4.0*566.
  
   a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
      message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not backup
      any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
   b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow
      you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
      installed.  (It compares all components of this patch routines,
      DDs, templates, etc.).
  
   c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
      to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
      global.
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option

 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
 ;;4.0;NATIONAL DRUG FILE;**[PATCH LIST]**; 30 Oct 98
    
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run 
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of 
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the PSN Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSN*4.0*566 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSN*4.0*566 in
 the patch list section on line 2.
