Subject: TRADE NAME ALLERGY DRUG CLASS UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch PSN*4.0*441 addresses the following issue:
  
 1. INC000001243262 - Tramadol, Clonazepam, and Diazepam patient allergies 
 with a Trade Name in the Reactant field need to be updated to account for 
 VA DRUG CLASS changes distributed with the National Drug File Data Update 
 patch PSN*4.0*453.
  
 **NOTE** This patch should be installed as soon as possible AFTER 
 installing patches PSN*4.0*453 and PSN*4.0*454 so that there is no 
 discrepancy between NDF data and the related patient allergies. This 
 patch contains an environment check routine that will stop the 
 installation of this patch if the data changes distributed with patch 
 PSN*4.0*453 are not yet installed.
   
 ***NOTE***  There might be some non-standardized Patient Allergy entries 
 (e.g., where the Reactant is ULTRACET TAB) that will NOT be updated by 
 either of the patches. Please watch for a follow up Outlook message with 
 further instructions and search templates to use for the additional clean 
 up that might be needed after installing patch PSN*4.0*441.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC000001243262 - Trade Name allergies to Tramadol, Clonazepam, and 
 Diazepam need to be updated.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Some Tramadol, Clonazepam, and Diazepam VA Products had incorrect VA Drug 
 Classes. NDF Data Update Patch PSN*4.0*453 updates the classes for these 
 products (CN101 - OPIOID ANALGESICS for Tramadol,Tramadol/Acetaminophen, 
 and Acetaminophen/Tramadol, CN302 - BENZODIAZEPINE DERIVATIVE
 SEDATIVES/HYPNOTICS for Clonazepam and Diazepam) as well as the related 
 patient allergies but it doesn't account for patient allergies where the 
 Reactant field contains a Trade Name. These allergies still need to be 
 updated to include the correct class.
    
 Solution:
 ---------
 This patch (PSN*4.0*441) updates patient allergies where the GMR Allergy 
 field contains Tramadol, Tramadol/Acetaminophen, Acetaminophen/Tramadol,
 Clonazepam, or Diazepam VA Generic and where the Reactant field contains a
 Trade Name for one of the corresponding VA Products. Allergies entered in
 error and allergies for deceased patients will not be updated. Note some
 sites might not have any Trade Name patient allergies affected by the
 class changes in patch PSN*4.0*453.
