Subject: FIXED MEDICATION COPAYMENT TIER (FMCT) #2

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch will provide enhancements to the National Drug File (NDF)
 package for Fixed Medication Copayment Tiers (FMCT) project. It supports
 the redesign and/or enhancement of the current structure of charges for
 first-party outpatient medication copayments to treat non-service
 connected conditions.  This project brings the Department of Veterans
 Affairs (VA) into compliance with the Proposed Rule 38 Code of Federal
 Regulations (CFR) Part 17 Copayments for Medications.
  
 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this project along
 with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    To be released as a host file:
    National Drug File (NDF) V. 4.0                    PSN*4*492
    Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0              PSS*1*200
  
    To be released as a host file:
    Outpatient Pharmacy (OP) V. 7.0                    PSO*7*460
    Integrated Billing (IB) V. 2.0                     IB*2*563
  
    To be released as a standalone forum patch on or about 1/6/2017:
    Accounts Receivable (AR) V. 4.5                    PRCA*4.5*312
  
 This rulemaking eliminates the Medical Consumer Price Index (CPI-P) 
 formula used to calculate future rate increases and establishes the 
 following three classes of medications, identified as Tier 1, Tier 2, and 
 Tier 3, beginning February 27, 2017:
  
         Tier 1 = $5 for a 30-day or less supply of a medication; 
         Tier 2 = $8 for a 30-day or less supply of a medication; and 
         Tier 3 = $11 for a 30-day or less supply of a medication.  
  
 In addition to the rule, Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) made the 
 addition of Tier 0 for excluded and exempt products with no copayment.
  
 In order to comply with the Federal regulations, modifications are 
 included in these patches to support fixed copayment amounts depending on 
 the class of the medication (Tier 0, Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3).
  
 The VA wide Outpatient Medication Copayment Cap per calendar year which 
 was for only Priority Groups 2-6 is being extended to include Priority 
 Groups 7-8.  The new Outpatient Medication Copayment Cap effective 
 January 1, 2017 will be $700 for all Priority Groups subject to 
 Outpatient Medication Copayments (2-6).
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
 1. The Inquire to National Files [PSNACT] option contains modifications 
 to display the copay tier information for the product after the National 
 Formulary Restriction field.
  
 2. The Inquire to VA Product Info For Local Drug [PSNLOOK] option has 
 been modified to display the copay tier information.
