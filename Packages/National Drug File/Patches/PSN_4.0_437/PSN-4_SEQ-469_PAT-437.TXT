 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
 INC000001101939 NDF IPV6 CONVERSION 
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 In preparation for the VA's transition from Internet Protocol version 4 
 (IPv4) to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), the National Drug File 
 (NDF) package will require modifications to make it IPv6 ready.
  
 IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IP), the 
 communications protocol that provides an identification and location 
 system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. 
 IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal 
 with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 is 
 intended to replace IPv4.
  
 VistA is only compatible with IPv4 currently and this effort is to prepare
 for IPv6 compatibility.
  
    
 Resolution:
 ----------
 As part of the transition for the National Drug File (NDF) package,
 modifications were required to include evaluation of the current system to
 determine what version of IP is enabled and format each referenced IP and
 loopback address accordingly.
