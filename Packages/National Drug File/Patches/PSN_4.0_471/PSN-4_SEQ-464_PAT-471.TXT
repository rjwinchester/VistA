 I7357301FY16 - Old VA Drug class needs to be removed from ALFUZOSIN
 patient allergies where the Reactant is a Trade Name
  
 Problem:

 some sites might not have any Trade Name patient allergies that need to

 potential disruption to users. The installation may take some time and 
 will vary from site to site, depending on how many allergy records there
