Description:
============

 NOTE: This patch is part of NDF Data Update FY16 #7, which is comprised
 of two patches, PSN*4*478 and PSN*4*479.
  
 This patch provides updates to data in several of the files associated 
 with the National Drug File (NDF) application.  This patch generates four
 mail messages.
  
 All are sent from NDF MANAGER to members of the NDF DATA mail group, 
 holders of the PSNMGR security key, and the person installing the patch.  
 The first message, with the subject DATA UPDATE FOR NDF, lists new
 products, CMOP ID (if one exists), dispense units, and associated NDCs,
 products for which the national formulary indicator has changed, products
 that have been unmatched from CMOP, and products for which the national
 formulary restriction has changed.  The second, with the subject UPDATED
 INTERACTIONS, lists interactions that have been added, edited, or
 inactivated. The third, with the subject DRUGS UNMATCHED FROM NATIONAL
 DRUG FILE, lists entries in the DRUG file (#50) which have been unmatched
 from NDF.  The fourth, with the subject INTERACTIONS and ALLERGIES
 UPDATED, lists interactions and allergies which have been changed because
 they were created with ingredients that are no longer primary ingredients.
  
                      **ATTENTION: CMOP SITES ONLY** 
  
 Do not load and install or queue to install this patch while Consolidated 
 Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) prescriptions are being transmitted. If
 transmissions are in progress, incorrect prescription information may be 
 sent to the CMOP. To determine if a CMOP transmission is in progress,
 examine TaskMan for jobs entitled "CMOP Data Transmission".

 This patch can be obtained from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of
 the OI Field Offices. The preferred method is to retrieve the file using
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from DOWNLOAD.VISTA.DOMAIN.EXT, which
 will transmit the file from the first available server. Alternatively,
 sites may elect to retrieve the file from a specific OI Field Office.

 National Drug File (NDF) and Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) users should 
 be off the system when this patch is installed.  Installation takes less
 than ten minutes.  This patch should be installed during non-peak
 requirement hours.
  
 The environment check routine for this patch checks that the installing 
 person is a valid user and that the patch has not been installed. If the 
 patch has previously been installed the installation will be aborted.
  
 1.  Retrieve the file NDF4P478.KID using one of the methods described 
     above.  
  
 2.  From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
     the Installation menu.  
  
 3.  From this menu, select the option Load a Distribution and select 
     NDF4P478.KID.  
  
 4.  From this menu, you may choose to use the option Verify Checksums in 
     Transport Global. When prompted, select PSN*4.0*478. All components of
     this patch are new, so the option Backup a Transport Global and the 
     option Compare Transport Global to Current System do not have to be 
     invoked.
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select PSN*4.0*478.  
  
 6.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//" 
     respond NO.

     Protocols? NO//" respond NO.                      
  
 8.  Note: The environment check routine PSN478E and the post-install 
     routine PSN478D will be automatically deleted from your system upon 
     completion of the installation.
