This file contains the VA Drug Classifications. Each five-character
"^DIC",50.605,50.605,"%D",11,0)
alpha-numeric code specifies a broad classification and a specific
"^DIC",50.605,50.605,"%D",12,0)
type of product. The first two characters are letters and form the
"^DIC",50.605,50.605,"%D",13,0)
mnemonic for the major classification (e.g., AM for antimicrobials).
"^DIC",50.605,50.605,"%D",14,0)
Characters 3 through 5 are numbers and form the basis for subclassification.
"^DIC",50.605,50.605,"%D",15,0)
The VA Drug Classification system classifies drug products, not
"^DIC",50.605,50.605,"%D",16,0)
generic ingredients. Drug products with local effects are classified
"^DIC",50.605,50.605,"%D",17,0)
by route of administration (e.g., dermatological, ophthalmic). If a
"^DIC",50.605,50.605,"%D",18,0)
product is not classified by route of administration, it is classified
"^DIC",50.605,50.605,"%D",19,0)
in most instances under a specific chemical or pharmacological
"^DIC",50.605,50.605,"%D",20,0)
classification (e.g., beta-blockers, cephalosporins). If a product
"^DIC",50.605,50.605,"%D",21,0)
is not classified by route of administration, or chemical or
"^DIC",50.605,50.605,"%D",22,0)
pharmacological subclassification, it may be classified under a
"^DIC",50.605,50.605,"%D",23,0)
therapeutic category (e.g., antilipemic agents, antiparkinson agents).
