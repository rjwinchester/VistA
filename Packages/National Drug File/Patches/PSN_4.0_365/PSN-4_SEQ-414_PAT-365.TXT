 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1.  INC000000864913 - Subscript error when sorting by name printing 
                       products marked for CMOP
  
 Problem:
 --------
 <SUBSCRIPT>N+1^PSNCMOP error when printing VA Products Marked for CMOP 
 Transmission (PSNCMOP option), when selecting sort by name option.  
    
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modified "Sort by Name" logic for evaluating the "Transmit to CMOP" field 
 in PSNCMOP routine to match the logic in "Sort by ID." 
  
  
 2.  INC000000744810 - Drug Identifier Data Dictionary description
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The current Technical Description for the Drug Identifier field (#1) of
 the Drug Ingredients file (#50.416) needs to be updated to more 
 accurately reflect what the field contains.
  
 Currently:
 The first number is the entry number to the National Drug file separated 
 with an ""A"". The second number is the particular product which contains 
 this ingredient in the National Drug file.  
    
 Solution:
 ---------
 The Technical Description of the Drug Identifier field of the Drug 
 Ingredients file (#50.416) will be updated as follows:
 The first number is the Internal Entry Number (IEN) from the VA Generic
 file (#50.6) followed by an "A". The second number is the Internal Entry
 Number (IEN) of the particular product from the VA Product file (#50.68)
 which contains this ingredient.
  
  
 3.  INC000000812050 - Invalid entries on Merge Error report for Additives
 and Solutions needing to be re-matched to Orderable Items
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In routine PSNPSS the IEN of the Dose Form for the Drug gets compared to 
 the Dose Form Name of the Orderable Item that the Additive or Solution is 
 matched to. Since the two values will never be equal, this is an invalid 
 comparison and gives false information on the Merge report.
    
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modified the comparisons for Additives and Solutions in routine PSNPSS to 
 compare the Dose Form IENs rather than IEN to the actual Dose Form Name. 
  
  
 4.  INC000000610447 - Incorrect drug identifier included under Varenicline
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Incorrect Drug Identifier 184A20598 (where 184 is the IEN for DIPHTHERIA 
 TOXOID/PERTUSSIS VACCINE/TETANUS TOXOID in the VA Generic file (#50.6) 
 and 20598 is the IEN for DIPHTH,PERTUSS(ACELL),TET (Tdap) VACCINE 
 (ADACEL) 0.5ML INJ in the VA Product file (#50.68)) under Varenicline in 
 the Drug Ingredients file (#50.416) is causing an invalid warning message 
 during Order check for patients with related allergy (e.g., when ordering 
 Tdap for a patient with recorded allergy to Varenicline). 
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 The incorrect Drug Identifier (184A20598) is being removed from the 
 Varenicline record in the Drug Ingredients file (#50.416) along with the 
 appropriate cross-references.
