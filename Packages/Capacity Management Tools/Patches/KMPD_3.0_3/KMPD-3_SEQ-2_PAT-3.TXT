Subject: UPDATE CPRS COVERSHEET LOAD REPORTING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses three issues with CPRS Coversheet Load reporting. 
  
 1. Current reports and status checks look only at background coversheet 
 load times. This patch will update routines to look check and report on 
 both background and foreground coversheet load times.
  
 2. The date range selector for reports is returning in incorrect start 
 date.
  
 3. Currently the data sent to the National Database only includes the 
 delta between the minimum and maximum load times for each hour. With this
 patch all data will be sent. Data will also be available for longer time
 periods at greater detail.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ----------------------------
 N/A
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Problem 1: Reports and status checks only look at background coversheet 
 load times.
  
 Problem 2: Data returned in the report does not match the date range 
 requested in the date prompt.
  
 Problem 3: Data reported to national level does not contain sufficient 
 detail for proper analysis.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Resolution 1: Updates reports and status checks to look at both 
 background and foreground load times. Data is stored under separate 
 subscripts. Routines must look at both and correlate each foreground and 
 background data set.
  
 Resolution 2: Fixed the date prompt code to return parameters as 
 requested by the end user.
  
 Resolution 3: Report all data. Analysis and reporting can then include 
 actual minimum, maximum and average load times per specified time 
 periods. Additional analysis can be done regarding use of CPRS.
