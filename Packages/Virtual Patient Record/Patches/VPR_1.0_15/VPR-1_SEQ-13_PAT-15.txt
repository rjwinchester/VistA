Associated patches: (v)VPR*1*10    <<= must be installed BEFORE `VPR*1*15'

Subject: DATA UPDATE LISTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch to the Virtual Patient Record (VPR) application will modify the 
 data monitoring utility, to prevent multiple entries from being stored in 
 the ^VPR("AVPR") and ^VPR("ANEW") update lists. When the Qualifying Patient 
 Query is run in preparation for the Regional Health Connect servers, data 
 monitoring is turned on but the RHC is not processing the updates yet so 
 these lists can get quite large. Instead of capturing every transaction, 
 the data monitor will now only make one entry in the appropriate ^VPR list 
 per VistA record.
  
 A post-init routine will queue a task to loop through the existing entries 
 in ^VPR("AVPR") and ^VPR("ANEW") and remove extraneous nodes, to keep global 
 growth in check. The routine supporting the management options on the 
 VPR HS MENU option menu is also updated to reflect and support this change.

     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter VPR*1.0*15.
   
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch

 -------------------------------
 A post-init routine will queue a task that will loop through the existing 
 entries in ^VPR("AVPR") and ^VPR("ANEW") and remove duplicate nodes. If 
 there are no nodes in either of these lists, no task will be queued. A 
 message will display the task# on screen, and in the Install file capture.
  
  
 Backout Procedures:
 -------------------
 During the VistA Installation Procedure of the KIDS build, the
 installer should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' action (step 3a
 in the Installations Instructions below). If rollback/backout is 
 required, the installer can use the MailMan message to restore routines 
 that were saved prior to installing the patch.
