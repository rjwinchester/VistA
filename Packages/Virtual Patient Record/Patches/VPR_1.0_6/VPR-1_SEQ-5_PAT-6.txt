Subject: VPR GET PATIENT DATA XML UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch to the Virtual Patient Record (VPR) package updates the VPR 
 GET PATIENT DATA remote procedure call (RPC).  This RPC extracts patient
 health data from the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology
 Architecture(VistA) database in Extensible Markup Language (XML) format.
  
 Currently, this RPC's output XML cannot be parsed by eHX Adapter because 
 the data contains special characters.  Specifically, notes that contain 
 the ASCII BELL (CTRL + G) character cannot be escaped within the RPC.

 CA SDM OVERVIEW:
 ================
 R7708760FY16 - VPR GET PATIENT DATA XML UPDATE
  
 Problem:
 --------
 XML data returned by VPR GET PATIENT DATA contains non printable 
 characters that are not properly escaped.  All non printable characters 
 must be escaped using entity references.  An example is notes which 
 contain the ASCII BELL (CTRL+G) character.  The RPC currently outputs XML 
 that cannot be parsed by eHX Adapter if such characters exist.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Modify ESC^VPRD to include the following line of code:
  
     F I=1:1:8,11,12,14:1:31 S X=$TR(X,$C(I))
  
 This line of code strips any unwanted control characters entered, 
 including bell(7), backspace(8), vertical tab(11), form feed(12),
 shift out(14), and unit separator(31).
  
 The exceptions would be tab(9), line feed(10), and/or carriage return(13).
