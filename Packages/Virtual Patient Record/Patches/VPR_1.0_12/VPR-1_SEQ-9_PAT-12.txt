Subject: XML RETURN ISSUES MISSING INITIAL FILL,NKA

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues in the VPR package:
  
 1. The XML return from the "Allergy/Adverse Reaction Tracking" type does 
 not include the "entered" date field if the allergy is "No known allergy".
  
 2. The routine VPRDGMRA has unnecessary code that is potentially 
 dangerous.
  
 3. The initial Fill date is missing from the Virtual Patient Record (VPR)
 XML output for Outpatient Medications.
