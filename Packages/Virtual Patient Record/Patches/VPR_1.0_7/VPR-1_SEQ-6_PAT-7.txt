Subject: RPC UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch to the Virtual Patient Record (VPR) package updates the VPR GET 
 PATIENT DATA and VPR GET PATIENT DATA JSON remote procedure calls (RPC) 
 that extract patient health data from a Veterans Health Information Systems 
 and Technology Architecture (VistA) database in Extensible Markup Language 
 (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formats, respectively.
  
 Specific data domains have been updated to support creation of C-CDA 
 documents for external patient care partners; these include:
   * Consults
   * Demographics
   * Lab Orders
   * Visits
  
 Additional data elements have been added to Consults and Demographics; see
 the updated VPR Technical Manual for details.
  
 Historical encounters are now being included with the Visit extract.
  
 This patch also corrects a problem with Lab Orders, reported by the VistA
 Health Information Exchange (VHIE) client. This extract previously attempted 
 to organize lab results by the order that requested them; the VistA 
 Laboratory application periodically purges the Lab Order File (#69),
 however, making these links difficult if not impossible to recreate over
 time. This patch changes the main loop to use the Orders File (#100)
 instead, then calling Lab for the results of those tests included in each 
 order.
