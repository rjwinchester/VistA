Description:
============

 This patch extends the Virtual Patient Record (VPR) application, to provide
 a new method of retrieving patient health data from a Veterans Health
 Information Systems (VistA) database.
  
 Patch DI*22.2*9 released a new VA FileManager utility that provides the
 ability to map VistA files and fields to other data models, and extract
 that data as XML or JSON objects. This VPR patch will populate the new
 Entity file (#1.5) to map VistA data elements to InterSystems' Summary
 Data Architecture (SDA) model, and use the new supported calls to retrieve
 the requested data.
  
 This patch also installs a mechanism to monitor clinical data events in VistA,
 to enable retrieval of updated information as a patient's data changes.
 New Protocol file (#101) entries will be added, and linked to appropriate 
 clinical application events; the file and record numbers modified will be
 collected in the new VPR Subscription file (#560) until retrieved and 
 updated.

 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 --------------------------------------------------
 Software is being released as a host file, DI_222_9_VPR_1_8.KID, containing
 two patches: DI*22.2*9 and VPR*1*8.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using Secure
 File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the
 following OI Field Offices:
  
 Hines:           domain.ext  
 Salt Lake City:  domain.ext
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library at:
 http://www4.domain.ext/vdl/

 Patch Installation:
 -------------------
 Refer to Patch DI*22.2*9 for installation instructions.
  
 Patches DI*22.2*9 and VPR*1*8 are scheduled to be released nationally as a
 bundle.  Installation of these patches into Production within the first 15
 days from the National Release date is requested. The VA leadership has 
 asked for an expedited release to comply with the schedule for the high
 profile Mission Act.  Certain functionality has to be loaded into
 production in 130 VA Medical Centers within a short timeframe.  We
 appreciate your cooperation.
   
   
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 Your site will be contacted when it is time for HealthShare to monitor 
 patient events.  At this time, no additional setup is needed after
 patch VPR*1*8 is installed.
  
  
 Backout Procedures:
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of the
 development team, health product support, and appropriate VA site/region
 personnel. All components exported by the patch (excluding linked Protocol
 menus) are new and could be removed from the system if needed. Please 
 call the national help desk or enter a help desk ticket for assistance.
