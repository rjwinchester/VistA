Description:
============

 This patch to the Virtual Patient Record (VPR) package corrects a problem
 with Lab Orders, first reported by the Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) client.
  
 This extract was changed in patch VPR*1*7 to use the Orders File (#100) to 
 find completed Lab orders, then extract the results tied to each, instead
 of first pulling data from the Lab Service and attempting to organize the 
 results by the order that requested them. The changes in patch VPR*1*7 did  
 not fully account for splitting an order across multiple accessions, so 
 some results were omitted from the payload. The date range search also
 changed from working off the Collection Time to the Date Released of the 
 order, due to the available indices on the Orders file. Both of these 
 issues have been corrected in this patch.
