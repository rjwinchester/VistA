Description:
============

 This patch to the Virtual Patient Record (VPR) application addresses four
 issues discovered during the pre-load of the HealthShare Edge Cache 
 Repositories (ECR):
  
 1. The $$DATE^VPRSDA function will be updated to do additional validation
    checks before sending the value to the ECR.
  
 2. Test patients, and patients being merged into another DFN, will now be
    screened out of the AVPR update list in production accounts.
  
 3. Invalid City names that are longer than 50 characters will be 
    truncated to prevent errors when saving in the ECR.
  
 4. Person Class X12 codes containing an "E" were being interpreted as
    exponential numbers, causing a Max Number error.
