Description:
============

 This patch to the Virtual Patient Record (VPR) application updates VPR 
 entries in the Entity file (#1.5) to correct 6 issues with the 
 HealthShare (HS) interface that were identified too late to be addressed 
 in VPR*1*8:
  
 1. Problems merged
    ---------------
    If the same problem is entered for a patient at multiple VA facilities, 
    HS will attempt to merge those entries in its Edge Cache Repository 
    (ECR). This patch adds the ExternalId property to the Problem container 
    Entities to prevent HS from attempting this merge.
  
 2. Allergies merged
    ----------------
    Like with problems, HS will attempt to merge the same allergy entered 
    for a patient at multiple VA facilities in its ECR. This patch adds the 
    ExternalId property to the Allergy container Entities to prevent HS from 
    attempting this merge.
  
 3. Radiology exam sets missing reports
    -----------------------------------
    The RadOrder container in HS only provides a link to a single report 
    as the result of an order; if an exam set is registered, multiple 
    reports may be created. This patch adds the DocumentNumbers property 
    to the RadOrder extension Entity to hold all report identifiers 
    for an order.
  
 4. Incorrect LOINC codes for Pathology reports
    -------------------------------------------
    A general LOINC code was previously assigned to all pathology reports 
    when stored in HS, for ease of searching; this patch changes the
    Anatomic Pathology Entities for the Document container to now assign
    a code based on the VistA Lab section.
  
 5. Missing Pathology orders
    ------------------------
    Previously only Chemistry orders were included in the LabOrder container,
    resulting in incomplete lab data for a patient and difficulty navigating
    to the pathology reports in SDA. All Lab orders will now be returned.
  
 6. Unknown Last Date of Treatment
    ------------------------------
    HS has the ability to aggregate data for a patient from multiple VA 
    facilities, but cannot easily identify which site treated the patient 
    most recently. This patch adds the LastTreated property to the VPR 
    PATIENT EXTENSION entity to store the date of the last visit for each 
    patient at a given VA facility.
