Associated patches: (v)VPR*1*4     <<= must be installed BEFORE `VPR*1*5'

Subject: XML UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch to the Virtual Patient Record (VPR) package updates the VPR GET 
 PATIENT DATA remote procedure call (RPC) that extracts patient health data 
 from a Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture 
 (VistA) database in Extensible Markup Language (XML) format, requested by 
 the Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) and Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) 
 projects. Data domains updated are:
   * Appointments
   * Clinical Procedures
   * Consults
   * Demographics
   * Documents
   * Functional Independence Measurements (new)
   * Immunizations
   * Insurance (Integrated Billing)
   * Lab (Results, Orders, Accessions)
   * Medications, Med Orders
   * Orders
   * Problems
   * Radiology
   * Surgery
   * Visits
   * Wellness Reminders (new)
  
 Additional data elements have been added to Demographics, Immunizations, 
 Labs, Meds, Orders, Radiology, and Visits. The coding system was added
 to Problems and Visits to support the ICD-10 effort, and the TIU 
 National Title VUID is now included throughout as well, when mapped.
  
 This patch also corrects bugs reported by the VLER and JLV clients. In 
 Demographics, the specialty attributes in the pcProvider element were 
 returned with the wrong label if not all were defined. The MAX number 
 parameter for Documents was not working properly if other search 
 parameters were also defined, causing incomplete results to be returned. 
 And incomplete documents were being included with the results for the 
 Accession, Clinical Procedure, Consult, Surgery, and Visit domains.
  
 One hard error was reported in Documents, with embedded note objects; 
 that is described below with its associated Remedy ticket, and is fixed.
  
 The routines supporting the VPR TEST XML option have also been updated to
 reflect changes made in this patch, and to make the test option more 
 intuitive and easier to use.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ----------------------------
 1. INC000001241357 <UNDEFINED>TEXT+3^VPRDTIU *IFN
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Many note templates contain objects, which can execute code from anywhere 
 in VistA to insert the desired data into the note text; in the reported 
 ticket, an object that returns the active medications list used and killed 
 a number of local variables also being used by the calling routine VPRDTIU.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Additional local variables have been added to the NEW command at the top 
 of the $$TEXT^VPRDTIU function, to protect them from any code that may be 
 called to resolve objects inside of the current note.
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 Cleveland, OH
 San Diego, CA
 South Texas HCS
