Subject: EPIP PSGW REMEDIATION 1.0

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  
 PSGW*2.3*19 provides the following enhancements to VistA: 
  
 - Displays the maximum allowed ward stock level when using the Enter/Edit 
 Nurses' On-Demand Request (80 column) [PSGW ON-DEMAND NURSING EDIT] option
 in the Auto Replenishment/Ward Stock Nurses' Menu [PSGW RN]. Since the
 Pharmacy will fill an order for no more than the allowed stock level,
 nurses need to know the amount of stock that they can receive at one time.
 Currently, the allowed stock level displays only when a request is placed
 for more than double the allowed amount. This modification always displays
 the allowed stock level, thus preventing delays and frustration when
 trying to reorder stock.
  
 This modification also displays the maximum allowed ward stock level when 
 using the Print an On-Demand Request Report by Date/AOU (80 column) [PSGW
 ON-DEMAND PRINT] option. This option is used by Pharmacy staff to review
 nurses' ward stock requests. The allowed stock level is not currently
 displayed on the report, so Pharmacy staff must look up this information
 to determine whether a request exceeds the allowed amount. This
 modification always displays the allowed stock level on the report, which
 allows Pharmacy staff to easily compare the allowed and requested amounts.
  
 This patch adds a system-level parameter WARD STOCK LEVEL 
 DISPLAY ON [PSGW_WS_LVL_ON] in the PARAMETER DEFINITION file (#8989.51) to
 turn the display functionality On/Off. Initially, this parameter is set to
 OFF (No). A user that holds the PSGWMGR security key at each site will
 need to set this parameter to ON (Yes) to activate this functionality at
 the site. To set the parameter, select the new AR/WS Package-wide
 Parameter Edit [PSGW PACKAGE PARAMETERS] option from the Set Up AR/WS
 (Build Files) [PSGW SETUP] menu. At the "WARD STOCK LEVEL:" prompt, enter
 "Y" or "N."
  
 - Adds the ability to automatically print requested ward stock medications
 on a designated printer within a pharmacy when a request is entered 
 using the Enter/Edit Nurses' On-Demand Request (80 column) [PSGW 
 0N-DEMAND NURSING EDIT] option. The pharmacy manager determines whether to
 use this functionality and which pharmacy printer should be designated as
 the default printer. This enhancement provides a new DEFAULT WS REQUESTS
 PRINTER field (#32) in the INPATIENT SITE file (#59.4). If a default
 printer is requested by the pharmacy manager, a VistA user with access to
 the Site Parameters [PSGW SITE] option must populate this field with a
 printer from the DEVICE file (#3.5) to activate the auto-print
 functionality. If the DEFAULT WS REQUESTS PRINTER field contains a
 printer, then the Nurse's Ward Stock request will automatically print to
 the designated printer. If the field is not populated with a printer, then
 the auto-print functionality is effectively turned off. For sites with
 multiple location entries in the INPATIENT SITE file, managers can
 designate a default printer for each location.

 printer from the DEVICE file (#3.5) for each area in the DEFAULT WS 
 REQUESTS PRINTER field (#32) in the INPATIENT SITE file (#59.4) that will
 be using the new auto-print functionality.
  
 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of this patch (because of the data 
 dictionary, option, and parameter changes), it is not recommended for 
 backout. However, in the event that a site decides to back out this 
 patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit 
 a CA Technologies Service Desk Manager (CA SDM) ticket. The development 
 team will then assist with the backout process.
  
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the PSGW routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the PSGW routines have been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain 
 the designation of patch PSGW*2.3*19 on line 2 in the patch list section.
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out; it does not confirm that data dictionary and option 
 changes have been backed out.
