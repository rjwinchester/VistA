Subject: ON-DEMAND REPORT DATE RANGE FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue:
  
 The report option Print an On-Demand Report by Date/AOU (80 column) [PSGW
 ON-DEMAND PRINT] was incorrectly filtering entries to be printed on the
 report according to the date range selected by the user.

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1. I10479329FY16  PSGW ON-DEMAND PRINT calculates wrong time
   
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When the user ran the report option Print an On-Demand Report by Date/AOU
 (80 column) [PSGW ON-DEMAND PRINT] and selected a date range that contained 
 a specific time (MMDDYY@HHMM) for either the BEGINNING or ENDING date
 prompts, the report filter did not work correctly causing the report to
 include entries outside the date/time range specified.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the routine, PSGWODP, to not allow a time to be included when 
 responding to the BEGINNING or ENDING date prompts.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 a. At the line BDT^PSGWODP the variable BDT, which holds the BEGINNING date
    range value, was being set with BDT=BDT-.1. This was wrong because the
    the time (HHMM) is accepted. This was corrected to BDT=BDT-.00001
 a. At the line EDT^PSGWODP the variable EDT, which holds the ENDING date
    range value, was being set with EDT=EDT+.3. This was also wrong because
    the time (HHMM) is accepted. Furthermore, this variable only needs to be
    reset if a specific time was not entered. The setting of this variable 
    was changed to S:EDT'["." EDT=EDT+.24.
