This patch will resolve the following issue:
"BLD",9545,1,2,0)
 
"BLD",9545,1,3,0)
The report option Print an On-Demand Report by Date/AOU (80 column) [PSGW
"BLD",9545,1,4,0)
ON-DEMAND PRINT] was incorrectly filtering entries to be printed on the
"BLD",9545,1,5,0)
report according to the date range selected by the user.

Problem: 
"BLD",9545,1,30,0)
--------
"BLD",9545,1,31,0)
When the user ran the report option Print an On-Demand Report by Date/AOU
"BLD",9545,1,32,0)
(80 column) [PSGWON-DEMAND PRINT] and selected a date range that 
"BLD",9545,1,33,0)
contained 
"BLD",9545,1,34,0)
a specific time (MMDDYY@HHMM) for either the BEGINNING or ENDING date
"BLD",9545,1,35,0)
prompts the report filter did not work correctly causing the report to
"BLD",9545,1,36,0)
include entries outside the date/time range and to also exclude entries
"BLD",9545,1,37,0)
within the date/time range selected.
"BLD",9545,1,38,0)
 
"BLD",9545,1,39,0)
Resolution:
"BLD",9545,1,40,0)
-----------
"BLD",9545,1,41,0)
Modified the routine PSGWODP to correctly set the filter variables for the
"BLD",9545,1,42,0)
date/time range so that each entry screened are correctly included or
"BLD",9545,1,43,0)
excluded from the report.
"BLD",9545,1,44,0)
 
"BLD",9545,1,45,0)
 
"BLD",9545,1,46,0)
Technical Resolution:
"BLD",9545,1,47,0)
---------------------
"BLD",9545,1,48,0)
a. At the line BDT^PSGWODP the variable BDT, which holds the BEGINNING 
"BLD",9545,1,49,0)
date
"BLD",9545,1,50,0)
   range value, was being set with BDT=BDT-.1. This was wrong because the
"BLD",9545,1,51,0)
   the time (HHMM) is accepted. This was corrected to BDT=BDT-.00001
"BLD",9545,1,52,0)
a. At the line EDT^PSGWODP the variable EDT, which holds the ENDING date
"BLD",9545,1,53,0)
   range value, was being set with EDT=EDT+.3. This was also wrong because
"BLD",9545,1,54,0)
   the time (HHMM) is accepted. Furthermore, this variable only needs to 
"BLD",9545,1,55,0)
be
"BLD",9545,1,56,0)
   reset if a specific time was not entered. The setting of this variable 
"BLD",9545,1,57,0)
   was changed to S:EDT'["." EDT=EDT+.24.
