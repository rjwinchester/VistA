Subject: MRSA PCR Results

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes an issue with the Multi-Drug Resistant Organisms (MDRO) 
 Program Tools, where it was not always picking up Methicillin-Resistant 
 Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Laboratory results. This was caused by sites 
 that started to report their MRSA PCR tests (i.e., MRSA SURVL NARES DNA or
 MRSA SURVL OTHER DNA) as DETECTED/Not Detected instead of 
 POSITIVE/Negative due to manufacturer specifications.
  
 For the MRSA Program Tools to continue to pick up MRSA laboratory results 
 for those sites, this patch will update the tools to consider a result of 
 "POSITIVE" or "DETECTED" as MRSA Positive (this is a case insensitive 
 comparison, so a result of "Positive" or "Detected" will also be 
 considered as MRSA Positive). This will be backwards compatible, and the 
 MDRO Program Tools should still work for sites reporting their results as 
 Positive/Negative. These changes have been hard-coded into the program and
 users will not need to make any changes via the MDRO Tools Lab Parameter
 Setup option.

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the  
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
   
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
   
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no  
 rollback strategy is required.
   
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum  
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
