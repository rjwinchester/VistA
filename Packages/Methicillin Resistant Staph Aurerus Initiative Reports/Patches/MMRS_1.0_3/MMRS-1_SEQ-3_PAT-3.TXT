Description:
============

 The MRSA Program Tools (MRSA-PT) Isolation Report (MMRS REPORTS MENU) 
 only lists patients for one (1) mapped etiology/sensitivity.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1) INC000000604438 MMRS Isolation Report Not Listing Multiple Indications
   
 Problem:
 --------
 The MRSA Program Tools (MRSA-PT) application permits the entry (mapping) 
 of multiple antibiotic sensitivity values for multiple etiologies 
 (organisms) for the purpose of identifying patients with indicated 
 results to be selected from the database and listed on the Isolation 
 Report (MMRS REPORTS MENU).  However, even though multiple organisms and 
 sensitivity parameters can be mapped, only patients with one of the 
 sensitivity indications (per antibiotic) are extracted to appear on the 
 report.  Infection Control staffs would like the Isolation Report to list 
 any patient with any of the etiologies/sensitivities mapped.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine MMRSIPC to retrieve runtime parameters for multiple
 mapped ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY file (#62.06) indications for an 
 ETIOLOGY FIELD file (#61.2) where previously it had only loaded one.
 And, modify routine MMRSIPC3 to use the additional indications to extract 
 additional patient cases for the Isolation Report.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can
    be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
          problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'MMRS*1.0*3.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
