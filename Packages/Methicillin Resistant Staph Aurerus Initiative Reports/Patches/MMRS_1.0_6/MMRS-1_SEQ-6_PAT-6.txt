Subject: SLOW MMRS CDI REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The patch addresses one (1) issue:
  
 1.   Many facilities report that the Multi-Drug Resistant Organism (MDRO)
      Tool Clostridium Difficile Infection (CDI) Report is running very
      slowly.  This is occurring because the report is examining a large
      set of microbiology results for every patient including those that
      fall outside of the date range specified at report run time.
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1.      I16266869FY17 - Slow MMRS CDI Report
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The report is examining a large set of microbiology results 
 for every patient including those that fall outside of the
 date range specified at report run time.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The patch modifies code in routine MMRSCDI1 to limit the results 
 examined for the report to the date range specified by the user 
 at run time.  Before the change (when search for microbiology 
 result candidates), the routine searched up to the current date 
 rather than the user specified end date.  The report run time may
 or may not be reduced because of the more limited number of 
 results searched.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
    The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch 
    can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
    NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
          problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
    2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
    3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the 
       following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the
       patch, MMRS*1.0*6:
          a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
             message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
             backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
          b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when this
             patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
             routines, DDs, templates, etc.
          c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
             transport global.
    4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option
       and choose the patch to install, MMRS*1.0*6.
  
    5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', enter No.
  
    6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
       and Protocols? NO//' enter No. 
  
    7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions
