Associated patches: (v)MMRS*1*4    <<= must be installed BEFORE `MMRS*1*5'

Subject: OBSERVATION PATIENTS AND OTHER UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NOTE: The Multi-Drug Resistant Organisms (MDRO) Prevention Coordinators 
 (MPC) will need to verify the site's local configurations for accuracy 
 and possibly re-configure in certain areas as the MMRS*1.0*4 patch will 
 have overwritten some of the site's original configurations. Do not run 
 any MDRO reports until the configurations have been verified and 
 remedied. The remediation steps must be completed prior to installing 
 MMRS*1*5.  The Remediation Guide contains sequential instructions for the 
 examination, verification, and possible re-configuration of MDRO 
 parameters. Read the entire guide prior to performing the steps outlined. 
 Appendix A contains a checklist which will aid in the steps required. 
 Print out the checklist prior to performing the instructions provided in 
 this guide. 
 Patch MMRS*1.0*5 will not overwrite a site's local configurations so you 
 may proceed with the instructions to install the MMRS*1.0*5 patch as 
 outlined in this Patch Description.
  
 The scope of this warranty patch includes the following:
  
  - Update to 'Facility CDI Cases Report' to include the 'Report 
    Period' in the report header.
  
  - Removal of the Print CRE Report from the MDRO Tools Reports Menu 
    and removal of the CRE Tools Site Parameter Setup from the MDRO 
    Tools Setup Menu.
  
  - The MDRO Prevention Initiative is expanding to include      
    observation patients that are housed together with acute care patients 
    (e.g. medicine and surgery). Facilities will now be required to
    report MDRO swabbing rates and Bed Days of Care (BDOC) for these
    observation patients to the Inpatient Evaluation Center (IPEC).
    In order to facilitate this, the MDRO Program Tools will be 
    updated to recode or ignore certain patient movements as follows:
  
    o A discharge from a mixed observation ward and admission to acute
      care ward will be considered as an interward transfer if the 
      admission to acute care was within two hours of discharge from
      observation. Note: The observation and admission wards are mapped
      to different geographical locations.
  
    o A discharge from a mixed observation ward and admission to acute 
      care ward will be ignored if the admission to acute care was within
      two hours of discharge from observation. Note: The observation
      and admission wards are mapped to the same geographical location.

  Installation Instructions:
  --------------------------
  1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
   
  2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
  3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
     the Installation Menu. From this menu, you may elect to use the 
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter
     MMRS*1.0*5.
   
     a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
        backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
        is installed. It compares all components of this patch
        (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
   
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
         transport global.
   
  4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option 
     and choose the patch to install.
   
  5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? No// Press <Enter>.

     NO// Press <Enter>.
   
  7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? NO// Press <Enter>.
   
  8. If prompted "Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0// respond 0.
  
   
   
  Post-Installation Instructions:
  -------------------------------
  After this patch is installed, the MDRO Prevention Coordinator (MPC) 
  will need to update the geographical units to include observation wards
  that are located together with an inpatient wards. For example, If a
  facility has a geographical unit 5 North made up of the ward locations
  5 North Med and 5 North Surg, and there is also a ward location 5 North
  Obs for observation patients, the 5 North Obs should be added to the 5
  North geographical unit. This can be accomplished using the option MRSA
  Tools Ward Mapping Setup [MMRS MRSA WARD MAPPING SETUP] located on the 
  MDRO Tools Setup Menu [MMRS MDRO TOOLS SETUP MENU).  Please see section
  4.4 of the MMRS User Guide for more information on how to edit a
  geographical unit.
  
  Back-Out Strategy:
  
  During the installation, if the option to back up routines was run as 
  directed, 'Backup a Transport Global', then routines have the ability to 
  be restored from the "backup" Mailman message that was generated.  
  However, the KIDS installation process does not perform a restore of 
  other VistA components such as Data Dictionary, cross-reference and
  template changes, etc.
  
  Rollback Procedure:
  
  The MMRS*1.0*5 build as well as any installed dependent patch changes 
  that follow these releases need to be taken out in reverse order in 
  which they were installed; routines and data dictionary modifications 
  and populated data must also be rolled back in reverse order.
