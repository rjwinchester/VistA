Subject: MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT ORGANISMS (MDRO) ENHANCED REPORTING

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 The scope of NSR #20140801 (Tracking Drug-Resistant Organisms) includes
 requests and other enhancements covered by one other NSR (#20140804
 Clostridium difficile Program Tools). The VistA Lab Enhancement (VLE)
 scope encompasses the need for the following: 
  
 - Timely Identification: Updating the Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus
   aureus Program Tools (MRSA-PT) observation status to align with VHA
   policy (VHA Directive 1036) and to ensure the timely identification of
   MDROs (including C. difficile and related infections) in VA facilities.
  
 - Automated Data Collection: Improving the MRSA-PT functionality to
   provide MDRO Prevention Coordinators (MPCs) and Infection
   Preventionists (IPs) with an automated data extraction program for
   MDROs (including C. difficile and related infections) to eliminate the
   use of labor hours for manual data collection, and ensure the accuracy
   of data.
  
 - Enhanced Reporting: Expanded reporting and report data functionality
   of the Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Program Tools
   (MRSA-PT).
  
 - Renaming the current Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus
   Program Tools (MRSA-PT) to: Multiple Drug Resistant Organism Program
   Tools (MDRO-PT) for MDROs including MRSA and Clostridium difficile
   (C. difficile) and Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). 
  
 - Two new reporting capabilities.  A Clostridium difficile Infection
   CDI report that will allow the MPCs and IPs to monitor problematic 
   C. difficile infections within the wards of a facility and a CRE report 
   that will allow the MPCs and IPs to monitor problematic CRE infections 
   within a facility.
