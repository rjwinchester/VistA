  Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
  --------------------------------------------
  I10870693fY16: Convert VistA data retrieval from Medical Domain Web 
  Service (MDWS) to VistA Integration Adaptor (VIA)
  to end NUMI's dependency on unsecure anonymous access.  This version
  V.15.3.1 has corrected the following defects:
    
  1. i12648434fy17 (RTC Defect 492580): Admissions and movements with the 
  Timestamp of 24:00 do not 
  sync or display correctly in NUMI. The 24:00 timestamp from VistA will 
  display as 
  00:00 in NUMI and affected observation stays display 24 more hours 
  of elapsed time than they should.  NUMI 15.3.1 will correctly sync and 
  calculate length of stay. Admissions and movements that occur with a 
  2400 timestamp  will be displayed in NUMI as the following day with a 
  00:00 timestamp.
   
  2. i15033411fy17 (RTC Defect 512060): Users should be able to search 
  patient by their full name, but NUMI only searches by 
  partial name and other methods such as SSN and last initial + last 4 
  digits of SSN.  NUMI 15.3.1 will support patient search by full name  
  except in situations where a name has multiple breaks.
  
  In addition an updated version of VIA will retrieve complete Admission, 
  Discharge and Transfer (ADT) data from VistA.
