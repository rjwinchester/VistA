 1. Rational Defect 749765 - Elements should have proper tab indexes, 
 improper navigation during tabbing, and keyboard navigational issues.

 740288, 721065, 779292, 779304, 779289, 271072, 740286, 721375
  
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 Keyboard navigation on NUMI web pages does not have the proper flow 
 causing users who are using a screen reader and a keyboard to move 
 erratically on the page.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 NUMI web pages now have improved keyboard navigation with the proper HTML 
 tags and HTML placement. Each case of tab ordering was examined. The 
 appropriate solution to support logical navigation of the page was 
 implemented.
  
  
 2. Rational Defect 749763 - Form elements must have labels so that screen 
 readers can identify the element in focus.
  
 Duplicate/Related:  749828, 749806, 749778, 749771, 749814, 749833, 
 749838, 749715, 749720, 749704, 749744, 749710, 749738, 749749, 749754, 
 749847, 749852, 721071, 779286, 779287, 749734, 749700, 721061, 721062,

 740842, 779298, 775375, 775378, 779283, 779284
  
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 Form elements are missing labels causing screen readers to not identify 
 what currently is in focus.  Some form elements are not correctly read 
 when focus is placed on them, or focus is not being placed on elements 
 appropriately.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Elements on the page have had labels assigned to them using associated 
 ID's or Aria-Labels. Form elements have been updated to receive focus 
 where appropriate so that existing error messages can be conveyed to the 
 user.  Form elements that have conditional business flow or help text 
 that are obvious to sighted users but need additional code to screen 
 readers to be redirected as appropriate.
  
  
 3. Rational Defect 740846 - Default list box has no default value, 
 uninitialized controls or forms have focus but no value to read.
  
 Duplicate/Similar: 740843
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 NUMI's Admin Sites page on load contains list box values that contain no 
 data as no data has been searched for yet by the user. Older screen 
 readers will sometimes not read the element properly if it is empty.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Screen readers now report that the list box is empty indicating no 
 results have been returned. Other form elements that had no default value 
 have been given them, or the default values that existed in an error 
 message were moved to the control with focus.  508 rules state that 
 controls where possible should have default values, even if the value is 
 a variation of "no value".
  
  
 4. Rational Defect 749758 - When using <ul> and <ol> tags they must be 
 well-formed. 
  
 Duplicate: 749751, 749849, 749853, 749735, 749726, 749731, 749701, 
 749697, 749830, 749822, 749780, 749816, 749808, 749834, 749712, 749717, 
 749721, 749773, 749706, 749740, 749746, 749755
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 HTML standards state that in order to use the Unorder List element in a 
 webpage the UL must contain a well-formed list element nested inside. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Screen readers may depend on these tags to provide counts of items to 
 visually impaired users. This can be important when presenting 
 information to the user for radio buttons where they want to know how 
 many options they'll have to pick from, or other controls like list boxes 
 or drop-down lists to have awareness of how many options there are to go 
 through.  The data to display is now nested in a LI tag creating 
 well-formed flow. 
  
  
 5. Rational Defect 74960 - Page must contain one main landmark for the 
 skip navigation link to navigate to.
  
 Duplicate: 749750, 749844, 749768, 749829, 749821, 749815, 749807, 
 749779, 749772, 749671, 749663, 749657, 749649, 749621, 749614, 749764, 
 749606, 749681, 749839, 749705, 749716, 749757, 749690, 749711, 749739, 
 749610, 749766, 749848, 749745, 749587, 749581, 749685, 749843
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 The Main landmark is required on all web pages as a notifier to users 
 that the portion of the page located inside the Main container is content 
 exclusive to the current page. Section 508 requires a main landmark on 
 each page for the skipnavlink to move to when a user selected.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 On each master page of NUMI the role="main" has been added to either a 
 main tag, body tag, or div that holds the main content of the page.
  
  
 6. Rational Defect 721063 - Skip navigation link is missing from the 
 application.
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 Section 508 Compliance requires a skip navigation link to be present on 
 all pages to skip over the menu bar and proceed directly to content on 
 the page. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Skip navigation link has been implemented in the NUMI application. It is 
 the first element of the page when using the keyboard following 508 
 standards.
  
  
 7. Rational Defect 740839 - .NET 1.2 is not Section 508 compliant.
  
 Duplicate: 740844, 740841, 740840
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 The old version of .NET 1.2 is not Section 508 compliant.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 NUMI has been upgraded to .NET 4.5. This newer version of .NET has 
 additional Section 508 functionality to assist with Section 508 
 compliance.  Version 4.5 of .NET is not fully compliant on its own, but 
 it adds many accessibility features over 1.2.  For example, it adds an 
 override for default text data sets in grid views and other screen reader 
 friendly functionality.
  
  
 8. Rational Defect 749832 - Elements must have sufficient color contrast 
 meeting Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) AA Standards.
  
 Duplicate: 749727, 749698, 749817, 749810, 749775, 749673, 749831, 
 749752, 749718, 749574, 721064, 749741, 749823, 749707, 749567, 749692, 
 749732, 749835
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 All combinations of text color, font size, background and foreground 
 colors must meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) AA Standards 
 to meet Section 508 Compliance. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 NUMI has elements with too little contrast.  This included many table 
 headers, datagrid elements, and the main menu.
  
 The commonly used colors are now:
 Table Headers: LigthSteelBlue with Black text
 Datagrid Headers: DarkBlue with White text
 Main Menu: DarkBlue with White text
  
  
 9. Rational Defect 740838 - NUMI Navigation Menu is not navigable with a 
 screen reader and keyboard.
  
 Duplicates: 721072, 740874
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 Section 508 requires NUMI Navigation Menu to be keyboard navigable and 
 focus must be stable for screen readers throughout navigation. Keyboard 
 navigation must ensure users can open and close all dropdowns and access 
 all links nested in the Navigation Menu. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 A new Navigation Menu using button click dropdown instead of hovering has 
 been created to replace the old menu.
  
  
 10. Rational Defect 740845 - Screen readers are having issues navigating 
 the nested table for sites on the NUMI User List page.
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Screen readers are having issues navigating the nested table located on 
 the NUMI User List page. The use of tables of data nested within tables 
 cause screen readers to lose focus and potentially become stuck inside 
 the nested table. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The nested table has been converted to a list located in a single cell 
 making it easier for screen readers to intercept the page and for user 
 navigation. 
  
  
 11. Rational Defect 749824 - ID attribute value must be unique.
  
 Duplicate:  749818, 749666, 749660
  
 Problem:
 -------
 HTML IDs should be unique from one another NUMI .NET components in 
 several instances have the same IDs. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 NUMI's duplicate IDs on pages have been renamed to make them unique to 
 prevent screen readers from becoming confused.  Some pages in NUMI had 
 dynamically added control identifiers that could confuse screen readers.  
 These controls have been explicitly named to prevent duplicates.
  
  
 12. Rational Defect 749845 - HTML headers should never be left empty.  
  
 Duplicate/Similar: 749841, 749836, 749825, 749819, 749811, 749804, 
 749776, 749769, 749747, 749742, 749713, 749708, 779826, 749826
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 NUMI is using empty header elements for spacing purposes. This is poor 
 HTML practice and needs to be brought into proper HTML standards. The 
 iFrame title elements must have descriptive values.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The empty headers were used for spacing purposes. They have been removed 
 and other 508 compliant headers have been used.
  
  
 13. Rational Defect 749851 - All HTML pages should have language 
 attributes to alert screen readers of default language.
  
 Duplicate: 749846, 749842, 749837, 749827, 749820, 749812, 749805, 
 749796, 749777, 749770, 749767, 749762, 749760, 749756, 749753, 749748, 
 749743, 749737, 749733, 749730, 749725, 749719, 749714, 749709, 749703, 
 749699, 749696, 749693, 749674, 749602, 749575, 749572, 749568, 749565 
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Users who install screen readers in a different default language than 
 English won't have the screen read correctly.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Add the language element for every page in the system.  This will allow 
 screen readers that have been installed with non-English default 
 languages to correctly read NUMI.
  
  
 14. Rational Defect 749781 - Radio inputs with the same name attribute 
 value must be part of a radial button group.
  
 Duplicate/Similar: 749774, 749809, 775377
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The radio button group located on Manual Vista Synchronization is not 
 properly defined and can cause screen readers to think it is a single 
 instance of a radio button and when it is in fact a single instance 
 inside a group of radio buttons.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The radio button group has been given a group title called Filter Group 
 and each individual button has been placed inside the group to help 
 inform the user.
  
  
 15. Rational Defect 779300 - On the Patient Stay Administration page, 
 focus is not shifting to the delete button after validating a stay.
  
 Problem:
 ---------
 NUMI users' focus is not moved to the delete button after they close the 
 message box popup.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Added keyboard accessible short cut alt+x to delete last validated stay. 
 Added a stay summary header and moved the delete button to the bottom of 
 the stay summary section. This was done so that a visually impaired user 
 would be able to have all elements of the stay read before making the 
 decision to delete (previously the delete button was at the top of the 
 summary would require a decision prior to stay information being read to 
 the user).
  
  
 16. Rational Defect 779299 - UM Review Listing verbally entered dates 
 causing crashes on uninitialized date fields.
  
 Problem:
 ---------
 NUMI contains an unhandled exception when entering dates into a field 
 with no default date.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Added default date range to the controls to prevent user from entering a 
 null date.  This approach has the additional benefit of giving users 
 their most commonly entered search criteria while avoiding an unhandled 
 exception in the third-party date control.
  
  
 17. Rational Defect 779290 - NUMI uses color or images to convey 
 informational messages.
  
 Duplicate: 749813, 749813, 779293
  
 Problem:
 ---------
 NUMI's notifications cannot use color as they only mean to convey errors, 
 informational, and warnings without a screen readable alternative.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Added the information to the tooltip to convey the meaning as color for 
 users.  In other places images were replaced with text for screen readers.
  
  
 18. Rational Defect 740847 - Treating Specialty Configuration Dynamic 
 HTML Table is not Section 508 Compliant.
  
 Problem:
 ---------
 The Dynamic HTML Table generated on the treating specialty configuration 
 is not Section 508 compliant. Business Owners would also like more 
 spacing between the links located inside the table.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The dynamic table has been reworked to meet Section 508 compliance, as 
 well as spacing and a delimiter has been added to help with spacing. 
  
  
 19. Rational Defect 823607 - 508 Compliance best practices
  
 Problem:
 ----------
 Lists default value needs to be located at the top of the list versus the 
 end of the list.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Updated the ordering of Patient category list on Patient selection / 
 worklist page selection filter to display "Patients with Undismmissed 
 stays" as the first item in the list which is selected by default.
  
  
 20. Rational Defect 823602 - User Guide updates for Section 508 
 compliance.
  
 Problem:
 ---------
 Users using screen readers can use a combination of accessibility keys to 
 navigate across the NUMI application efficiently where normal tab 
 navigation sometimes is cumbersome and may not work.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Updated the NUMI User Guide to include accessibility feature sections to 
 help users using screen readers with additional navigation tips.
  
  
 21. Rational Defect 830760 - Fortify Remediation
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Remediating Section 508 compliance defects caused some portions of the 
 code base to be no longer used.  Fortify flagged these as security risks.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The code which is no longer reachable has been commented out to allow for 
 passing Fortify scans.
