 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. INC0172999 - Table structure for AdmissionSource needs Primary
                 key/Unique key update
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 The original table structure design for the AdmissionSourc data 
 table inadvertently switched the primary and unique keys.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Switched the keys so the Primary Key is AdmissionSourceID and the unique 
 key is AdmissionSourceDesc.
  
 2. INC2565815 - Upgrade to .Net version from 4.5.2 to 4.7.2
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 The recent release of VistA Integration Adaptor (VIA) has required 
 Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.2) to be used by both the Internet 
 Information Services (IIS) web server and the Sync windows service. The
 synchronizer was not able to use 1.2 as the default connection property
 without either hardcoding or updating to 4.7.2.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The NUMI application was upgraded to.NET 4.7.2 so that both the
 web application and the windows service would be using the same technology
 baseline.
  
 3. INC2703561 - Date Filter Error
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 NUMI displays a generic error when the Date filter is selected and the
 Start Date is blank. This occurs on the Patient Selection screen, the
 Dismissed Patient Stay screen, and other NUMI pages.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Corrected code to require start date on all NUMI pages with date
 filters. This will ensure that no error occurs and all date filters
 have a date when submitting a date entry.
  
 4. INC2983292 - Super User All-Site Access
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 Site Administrators who are unaware of NUMI SuperUser privileges often
 revert their permissions on certain sites which inadvertently leaves them
 without access to those sites.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Corrected NUMI code to allow only NUMI SuperUsers to update other NUMI
 SuperUsers access. All the other Site Administrators without SuperUser 
 access will be restricted and given a warning message when trying to 
 update SuperUser access.
  
  
 5. INC2723124 - Error page displayed to the user
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When a user receives an error in NUMI on certain pages, they cannot log 
 back into NUMI after the error is received. When the user attempts to 
 start a new session in NUMI, the page jumps back to the error screen where
 there is no login feature.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Corrected Code to provide a hyperlink whenever an error occurs. The user
 will then be able to select the hyperlink entitled, 'Click Here to
 continue', to be taken to the login page or depending on where the error
 page occurred, the worklist page.
  
 6. INC2780015 - User Guide Update
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 Observation stay of 48 hours or less may span two calendar days. 
 However, only one review is required for the observation stay. The second 
 day will not be counted in the VHA Support Service Center Capital Assets 
 (VSSC) data due to a business rule set to count one.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Updated NUMI User guide for user awareness.
  
  
 7. INC4649382 - Remove Print Preview/Export to Excel buttons from
                 Utilization Management Review Listing
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 When the Print Preview/Export to Excel options found on Utilization 
 Management Review Listing page are selected it displays full SSN numbers 
 in printable form which produces a privacy risk.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
  
 Print Preview and Export to Excel buttons have now been removed 
 from the Utilization Management Review Listing screen with this patch, 
 WEBN*1.1*10. The NUMI User guide has also been updated to remove any 
 reference of this option.
  
 8. INC4563728 - Update NUMI User guide for Physician Advisor Review page
                 modified for Sec. 508 compliance
  
 Problem: 
 -------
 NUMI Physician Advisor Review page was modified for Sec. 508 compliance, 
 where the first radio button selection was selected (turned on) by 
 default. This change was not reflected in NUMI User guide.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Updated Section 9.3.1 of the NUMI User guide and Figure 151 screenshot to 
 show default radio button selection for Section 508 compliance.
