Subject: NATIONAL UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION (NUMI) VERSION 14.1 RELEASE

Category: 
  - Informational
  - Other

Description:
============

 National Utilization Management Integration (NUMI) is a web-based 
 application that facilitates Utilization Management (UM) at all VA Medical
 Centers (VAMC) to ensure that patients are receiving the right care at the
 right time at the right place to increase efficiency, promote quality, 
 improve access to care and ensure effective use of resources.
  
 NUMI users can perform the following functions:
  
 * Pre-populate patient stay information from VistA into a NUMI SQL 
   database which records patient stay information. UM reviewed outcomes, 
   reasons, and recommended levels of care are saved in the NUMI database.
 * Generate a list of patient admissions and hospital days that need to be
   reviewed to assist UM reviewers in organizing their workload.
 * For newly admitted patients, collect patient and treatment information
   to determine whether patients meet clinical criteria for inpatient
   admission.
 * Following admission, collect treatment information for each hospital day
   to determine whether patients meet continued stay criteria.
 * Standardize documentation of 
   + reasons for inpatient admissions or continued stays that do not meet
     clinical criteria for inpatient care, and 
   + recommended levels of care for admissions and continued stay days not
     meeting criteria
 * Provide Physician Advisors with an automated UM review list to access
   reviews, document agreement or disagreement with current levels of care,
   and add comments and recommendations regarding patients not meeting
   criteria.
 * Generate summary reports of UM outcomes to provide insight into system
   constraints and barriers and identify quality improvement opportunities.
 * Assign specific reason codes for reviews that do not meet criteria. The
   VA-specific reason code structure will enable UM staff to aggregate and
   analyze the most prevalent reasons why patients are not meeting criteria
   at their current level of care. This information provides insight to
   help identify quality and access improvement opportunities.
 * Display a list of patient stays and review information, with filters and
   search features to assist in organizing individual reviewer workloads
 * Allow the reviewer to filter the display of patients based upon
   observation status in both worklist and reports.
 * Allow the Administrator to select the Automatic Dismissal Filter
   criteria on a per site basis.
 * Upon any synchronization, the program shall automatically check the
   Treating Specialty and other filter parameters for compliance with
   Automatic Dismissal Filter criteria and if the patient's clinical
   parameters lie within the boundaries of the filter criteria, that
   patient shall be dismissed.
  
 The purpose of this software product release is to fix defects reported
 with NUMI v1.1.14.0 when it was released into production by the
 development team. This patch NUMI v1.1.14.1 contains fixes for 15 defects

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
  
 INC000000887582
 Problem: Reminder date not automatically incrementing. 
 Solution: A fix implemented in the current patch corrects the defect
 reported on Saved Review Summary Screen by automatically
 setting the Reminder Date to the following day. 
  
 INC000000973957
 Problem: NUMI user with Super User privileges cannot Add and Edit an
 individual user under Admin/Users screen. 
 Solution: A fix implemented in the current patch corrects the defect hence
 enabling Super Users to add and edit an individual user under Admin/Users.
  
 INC000000879320
 Problem: Patient transfers noted on the Stay Movement List are not 
 aligning with the stay appearing on the work list. Example: A patient is 
 currently in Ward 5N and the movement table shows the transfer. The 
 patient work list shows the patient stay in ICU which was the original 
 location when the stay was created.
 Solution: A fix implemented in the current patch corrects the defect 
 reported by pulling Patient Movements, Treating Specialty, Ward, Service 
 Section and Attending Doctor information from the Stay Records.
  
 INC000000902444
 Problem: The status icons will not update & not recognizing a continued 
 stay review done on a Patient who has transferred in. Blue triangle icon 
 remains.  
 Solution: A fix implemented in the current patch corrects the defect 
 reported by displaying a completion icon (green circle) if each 
 non-discharge day has a review of any kind (admission or continued stay.)
 If these conditions are not met, a blue triangle is displayed.
  
 INC000000868812
 Problem: On Patient selection screen, hovering mouse over ellipses when 
 field data extends in length beyond box no longer displays the entire 
 data.
 Solution: A fix implemented in the current patch corrects the defect 
 reported by improving the Tool Tip functionality on Patient Selection 
 Screen.
  
 INC000000883747
 Problem: Undefined Treating Specialties causing errors.
 Solution: A fix implemented in the current patch corrects the defect 
 reported by displaying NULL Facility Treating Specialties as "Unknown" on
 the Primary Review page.
  
 INC000000889997 
 Problem: NUMI screens have "powered by Medora" and "A product of the VA
 Ann Arbor Healthcare Center.." at the bottom.
 Solution: In the current patch, text "Powered by Medora" and "A Product of
 Ann Arbor Healthcare Center" is removed from all NUMI application screens.
  
 INC000000866745, INC000000866119
 Problem: For reviews meeting and not meeting criteria, admission reviews, 
 continued stays reviews, and various other scenarios, there is an error if
 no clinical findings are selected.
 Solution: A fix implemented in the current patch corrects the defect 
 reported by setting subset and day-of-care to NULL if no clinical findings
 are selected.
  
 INC000000868483
 Problem: Deleting a review, and then adding a new one on the same
 patient/day undeletes the old one.
 Solution: A fix implemented in the current patch corrects the defect 
 reported by refreshing the History Screen once a review is deleted.
  
 INC000000889977 
 Problem: NUMI Primary Review Screen under Criteria Met currently 
 "Criteria Not Met No". Should simply say "Criteria Met: No" or 
 "Criteria Met: Yes" 
 Solution: A fix implemented in the current patch corrects the defect 
 reported by updating the NUMI Primary Review screen wording for label 
 "IQ Criteria MET:" to state either "Yes" or "No".
  
 INC000000768019
 Problem: Free Text search in Utilization Review and other pages works 
 erratically.
 Solution: A fix implemented in the current patch improves the free text 
 search functionality.
  
 INC000000865693, INC000000919204
 Problem: Invalid dismissed stays are still showing on the patient 
 selection screen when the "patients currently in beds" criterion is 
 selected.
 Solution: A fix implemented in the current patch partially corrects the 
 defect reported by displaying a warning message to the user stating that 
 the stay cannot be found in VistA when a reviewer tries to access a stay 
 that has been deleted in VistA. The deleted stay is moved to the Patient 
 Stay Administration screen. Note: Another fix will be needed in the future
 to restore the last step of the invalid stay processing so that deleting 
 an invalid stay completely from NUMI is again possible.
 INC000000863454
 Problem: When reviews are copied, the new reviewer name does not transfer
 to the Show Reviews list. The new reviewer does appear on the work list in
 the Reviewer column.
 Solution: A fix implemented in the current patch corrects the defect
 reported by ensuring that copied reviews display the accurate reviewer 
 name on History and Primary Review pages.
  
 INC000000884685
 Problem: Patients with long DFNs causing errors and not behaving like 
 other patients.
 Solution: A fix implemented in the current patch corrects the defect 
 reported by gracefully processing patients with long DFN numbers.
  
 INC000000894651
 Problem: NUMI InfoLog Table contains NULL values for UserName.
 Solution: A fix implemented in the current patch corrects the defect 
 reported by capturing a UserName in the InfoLog table when an application
 error is reported.
