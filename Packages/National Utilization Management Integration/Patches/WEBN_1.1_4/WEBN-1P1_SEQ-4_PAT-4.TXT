 1.      1010901
  
 Problem:
 -------
 In the Primary Review screen, when the user selects the checkbox for 
 criteria is NOT MET and formal hospital policy does NOT require physician 
 review, NUMI should not allow them to enter a Physician Utilization 
 Management Advisor (PUMA) name. A red text warning upon attempting to 
 save the review should appear: "A PUMA name and the box indicating no 
 PUMA review needed cannot be selected at the same time."
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The PrimaryReview.aspx.cs file was changed to include the logic which 
 checks for the condition where the checkbox is checked and the drop down 
 list is populated.If both conditions are true, a warning message will be 
 displayed.
