                        (VistA)is down.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1.   INC000000860295
 Duplicates:  INC000000872725, INC00000879464, INC00001049785,
  INC00001105218, INC00001104591, INC00001102317, INC00001062371,
  INC00001044629, INC00001027121, INC00001021755, INC00001019894,
  INC00001017124, INC00001007114, INC00001058705, INC00001118602
  
    Problem: 
    NUMI inappropriately invalidates stays if a user clicks on a stay when 
    their VistA system is down, or when network problems prevent NUMI from
    connecting to their Vista system. NUMI moves the stay to the Patient 
    Stay Admin screen where it must be "validated" which takes time; users
    typically report these as "lost" stays and do not enter reviews on 
    them. The lists are cumulative and growing large at many sites. The 
    NUMI v.1.1.14.3 build will detect VistA connection problems and let 
    the user know to try again later rather than invalidating the stay.  It
    also fixes features of the DELETE and RESTORE buttons on the Patient
    Stay Admin screen which can be used to delete a stay if it is not 
    found in VistA and restore the stay if it still exists in VistA.
  
    Resolution:
    The History.aspx.cs file was changed to redirect the Uniform Resource 
    Locator (URL) and added the VistA down check based on the Medical
    Domain Web Services (MDWS) (visit method) service call.
  
  
  
 2.   INC000001059706
 Duplicates:  INC000001254870
  
    Problem: 
    NUMI is not always saving the reason code on "Not Met" reviews. The
    not met reviews are saved in 2 separate transactions, first the
    review, then the reason code, so the reason code save is 
    failing after the review save succeeds. No error message is displayed
    to the user when the reason code is not saved.
  
    Resolution: 
    PrimaryReview.aspx.cs and PatientReviewManager.cs were changed and the
    method signature for SavePrimaryReview was changed to accept one more
    string parameter by reference.
  
  
 3.      INC000000882340 
 Duplicates: INC000000877737, INC000000900221, INC000000912841,
  INC000000919339, INC000001054134, INC000001266601
  
    Problem: 
    NUMI Reports include one extra day outside of the selected date range.
    The Review Date will be the date used to determine if a stay should
    be included in the report output.
  
    Resolution: 
    The following files were corrected:PatientDetails.aspx.cs,
    PatientLevelMetNotMet.aspx.cs, PatientLevelMetNotMetCustom.aspx.cs,
    PhysicianAdvisor.aspx.cs, PhysicianUMAdvisorResponse.aspx.cs,
    ReasonsCSReviews.aspx.cs, ReasonsforAdmReviews.aspx.cs,
    SummaryMetNotMet.aspx.cs, SummaryRLOCReason.aspx.cs and
    Unscheduled30DayReadmit.aspx.cs
  
  
 4.   INC000000878979
  
    Problem: 
    Report #12 always displays "no records found" if filtering criteria is
    "Service/Section".  Any other filter correctly finds the reviews.
  
    Resolution: 
    Corrections were made to the procedure dbo.usp_Report_DetailedPatient.
  
  
 5.   INC000000711901
  
    Problem: 
    When a report is saved, the text box inaccurately says "This review
    will now lock into the NUMI database. Further changes require an
    administrator. Are you sure you are ready to lock this review?"
    However, the person who enters the review can unlock and edit or
    delete the review, so the 2nd sentence needs to be removed or
    corrected.
  
    Resolution: 
    The second sentence has been removed from the message dialog box that
    appears while saving the review.
  
  
 6.   INC000000436600
  
    Problem: 
    Report #7 does not look up a patient by initial+4. It displays a 
    confusing message instead: "Please select . . . " without anything
    to select from. 
  
    Resolution: 
    Corrections were made to the procedure
    dbo.usp_lookupValue_PatinetnameListHasReviews so that initial+4 
    can be used to look up patients for Report #7.
  
  
 7.   INC000000866442
  
    Problem: 
    Criteria Not Met Elaboration text is lost on "not met" reviews when
    they are unlocked and edited.  The text is saved in the NUMI
    database on copied reviews, but the user cannot see it from the 
    NUMI application. 
  
    Resolution: 
    Changes were made to ReviewItems.cs and Review.aspx.cs to display 
    Criteria Not Met Elaboration text when reviews are unlocked and
    edited.
  
  
 8.   INC000001093525
 Duplicates:  INC000001093523
  
    Problem: 
    Manual VistA Synchronizer errors and occasional crashes during
    nightly, hourly, and  24-hour manual Synchronizer attempts on bad
    VistA data. Lodger admissions should be excluded from 
    Synchronizer data retrieval. 
  
    Resolution: 
    Lodger type admissions will not be displayed to the user for
    selection. 
  
  
 9.   INC000000375565
  
    Problem: 
    NUMI should not allow copying an admission review to a continued stay
    date. 
  
    Resolution: 
    PrimaryReview.aspx.cs and Review.aspx.cs has been changed so that the
    "copy" button will no longer be available for admission reviews.
  
  
 10.  INC000000946312
  
    Problem: 
    CERMe legal disclaimer/copyright text on NUMI screen displays needs to 
    be updated. 
  
    Resolution: 
    An extra menu item has been added under the Help Menu and allows users
    to view the entire copyright text.
  
  
 11.  INC000001231842
  
    Problem: 
    Currently NUMI cannot tell when a Manual VistA Synchronization failed
    and reports false success.  It should display an appropriate error
    message when the user's VistA system is down and the synchronization
    has failed. 
  
    Resolution: On the Manual VistA Synchronization page, when the user
    clicks on the Find Stays in VistA button, upon entering the search
    criteria, the error message "VistA unreachable, Please try again
    later" is displayed to the user if, for any reason, NUMI
    is not able to connect to  VistA. The staysynchronizer.cs,
    patientstaymanager.cs and syncondemand.aspx.cs files were modified
    to add the error message.
  
  
 12.  INC000001243857
  
    Problem: 
    Attending and/or provider need to be carried over from last known
    value on the Patient Selection Worklist and elsewhere.  
  
    Resolution: 
    If a movement does not include attending and/or provider, NUMI will
    look back to the most recent previous movement(s) to fill in the
    missing field(s). The admission record in these cases should not
    have values missing. Changes were made to the NumiStay.cs file.
