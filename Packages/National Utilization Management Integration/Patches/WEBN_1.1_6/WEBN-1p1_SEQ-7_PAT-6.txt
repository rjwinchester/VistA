Subject: NUMI Application 15.4

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Patch WEBN*1.1*6 addresses issues with the CERME scrollbar and error 
 pop-ups with certain subsets, wording changes to the generic NUMI error 
 message, inactivating BH review types, and a new warning if a user 
 selects a review type that will cause observation (OBS) hours to 
 accumulate on a non-observation treating specialty. It also includes 
 handling of page styling issues caused by CERME upgrade to Review Manager 
 (RM) 16.1 and InterQual (IQ) 2017.2.

 CA Service Desk Overview:
 ================
 1.      I13594028FY17 - Update NUMI CERME Criteria.
  
 Problem: The current NUMI production version has errors when selecting 
 certain subsets. McKesson fixed these issues in their new RM 16 release.
  
 Resolution: Sequentially upgraded CERME to RM 16 and IQ 2017, then RM 
 16.1 and IQ 2017.1, and finally IQ 2017.2, and loaded custom datasets.
  
 2.      I13792734FY17 - OBS review Type Table modification.
  
 Problem: Request to remove certain behavioral health (BH) review type 
 selections and merge associated care level types.
  
 Resolution: The NUMI database and code have been updated to remove BH 
 review type selections.  The BH Admission review type has been merged 
 into Admission.  The BH Continued Stay review type has been merged into 
 Continued Stay.  And, NUMI code will now allow reviewers to edit 
 previously saved BH Admission and BH Continued Stay reviews and change 
 the review type to either Admission or Continued Stay.
  
  
 3.      I10622124FY16 - Bad NUMI error message.
  
 Problem: Request to update generic NUMI error message wording.
  
 Resolution: Updated generic NUMI error message text on Error.aspx file as 
 per request.
  
   
 4.      I11598251FY17 - Accidently clicked on BH continued stay on a 
 review.
  
 Problem: Users were unable to edit review types on saved reviews.
  
 Resolution: Updated NUMI code to handle review type selection change when 
 editing previously saved reviews.
  
  
 5.      I13115557FY17 - NUMI and VISTA Concerns
  
 Problem: Admissions with non-observation treating specialties are 
 accumulating observation hours. This issue results from users selecting an
 observation review type for admissions with a non-observation treating
 specialty.
  
 Resolution: Added a warning message when observation review is selected 
 for non-observation admissions on Primary Review screen. Users will still 
 be allowed to select an observation review type if necessary. However,
 if an observation review type is selected in spite of the warning, the 
 system will assume the user is correct and will keep adding observation 
 hours and listing the stay as an observation stay on the Patient 
 Selection/Worklist.
