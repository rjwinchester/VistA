Subject: NUMI 15.5

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The NUMI WEBN*1.1*8 patch addresses issues with logging data in the NUMI 
 Weblog table, handling errors during the manual synchronization 
 operation, informing users of missing patient stay information like 
 treating specialty, allowing only super users to unlock expired Physician 
 Utilization Management Advisor (PUMA)reviews, also known as Physician 
 Advisor (PA) reviews, allowing only super users to unlock/delete primary 
 reviews that have expired PUMA reviews, allowing review owners to unlock 
 a copied review entered by another user, hiding the unnecessary and not 
 always accurate Episode Day of Care value on the Primary Review and 
 Review screens, adding a time stamp to the NUMI generic error handling 
 message, and informing users with more specific error messages when 
 possible.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. I15949791FY17 - OQSV / NUMI - Expired PUMA Reviews w/comments after 
 exp date
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Expired Physician Advisor (PA) reviews show up with comments made after 
 the expiration date because users are allowed to unlock PA reviews.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 To prevent expired PA reviews from showing up with comments this patch 
 will limit the ability to unlock a PA review to super users only. In 
 addition, only super users will be able to unlock/delete primary reviews 
 associated with expired PA reviews.
  
  
 2. I13901016FY17 - Wrong Episode Day of Care on BH reviews
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 The NUMI Patient Review table was not designed to capture a non-integer 
 value like 1-13, 13-X etc. Hence the episode day of care field displays 
 an incorrect value on the Primary review screen. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 To avoid the mismatch between the episode day of care field on the 
 Primary review screen and the actual value displayed in the CERME criteria
 in the lower section of the Primary review screen, the episode day of
 care label will be hidden. Users are required to retrieve this information
 from CERME criteria.
  
  
 3. R17135118FY18 - add a timestamp to the generic NUMI error displays
  
 Problem:
 --------
 NUMI generic error messages do not display a date/timestamp to the user. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch adds a DateTime string to the Error.aspx page. This should 
 help somewhat in finding the errors in logs and monitoring when they are 
 reported to Tier 2 and Tier 3 for troubleshooting.
  
  
 4. I10746276FY16 - Deceased patient warning disappeared from NUMI
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The User Guide describes a deceased patient warning that should appear in 
 NUMI when a deceased patient is selected. This warning is no longer 
 appearing. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A null check/empty code was added to History code to catch the deceased 
 date and display the message.
  
  
 5. I19305917FY18 - Copying a PUMA not met review issue - PUMA child table 
 carrying old values over on the copy function
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 NUMI generates a child record for copied PA reviews and the values 
 persist.  This means that when the copied review does not require 
 physician review, the physician ID from the original review still exists 
 on the record and the physician's name is preselected on page load.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Copied reviews will no longer carry over the original reviews PA review.  
 This was the source of the data that was creating the problem.
  
  
 6.  I16085632FY17 - Cannot unlock a copied review  
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 NUMI does now allow a reviewer to unlock a copied review if the original 
 was created by another user.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The unlock transaction has been changed to check for the creator of the 
 copied review instead of the original review.
  
  
 7. R6335030FY16 - OQSV / NUMI - Modify NUMI Login Screen
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 NUMI does not store the network credentials for first time users 
 automatically.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch will save users' network credentials automatically if they 
 don't exist (are null) in the database.
  
  
 8. I7954988FY16 - PUMA review not required box checked but PUMA notified
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 NUMI is notifying PAs of copied reviews even when the review checkbox has 
 been unchecked to denote it shouldn't go the PA.  It's also displaying 
 the date in the data grid at the bottom of the review page of the PA 
 review. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Copied reviews will no longer carry over the original review's PA 
 review.  This was the source of the data that was creating the problem.
  
  
 9. I18133087FY18 - NUMI Table Not Replicating.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The table NUMI.WebLog on SQL24 is not receiving replicated data from the 
 NUMI production database; the data on SQL24 ends on Oct. 4, 2017. This 
 table is supposed to be part of the replication process so it needs to 
 have up-to-date data replicated from the production database.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 An enhanced Method call was created to write to the log and work with 
 Fortify fixes.
  
  
 10. I17515964FY18 - User cannot pull up a profile for one particular 
 person in her database.
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Occasionally a VistA admission does not have the Patient Movement Type 
 information which NUMI considers mandatory. When this happens NUMI fails 
 and throws a generic error.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Error handling was added to check for MovementType in the NUMI 
 application to prevent NUMI from crashing.
  
  
 11. I17637739FY18 - NUMI manual sync error when a movement is missing key 
 data such as Treating Specialty, Provider info.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Manual Synchronization with VistA page would crash NUMI if data were 
 missing from the VistA Patient Stay that NUMI considered mandatory for 
 synchronization. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Manual Synchronization with VistA will now display an error stating which 
 stays did not synchronize into the application and advising the user that 
 the data should be corrected in VistA and re-synchronized. In addition
 the stay with missing data will be written to the info log in the
 database with the patient name and the stay ID.
  
  
 12. I10844162FY16 - Synchronizer can't handle missing VistA treating 
 specialty (TS) Admission record
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a patient is admitted in VistA, 2 records are created - one is the 
 admission record and the other is the TS/provider assignment. If the 
 admission record is deleted, but the specialty/provider record remains, 
 NUMI always gives the generic "an error has occurred" screen when the 
 stay is selected. NUMI should be treating it as an invalid stay and 
 presenting the user with the message that the stay can't be found in 
 VistA and automatically dismissing it so that it appears on the Patient 
 Stay Admin screen.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 NUMI will detect an incoming stay from VistA Integration Adapter (VIA) 
 with an admission date of 1/1/1900.  The VIA returned stay keeps the 
 admission record internal entry number (IEN) even when no admission 
 record exists because it is referenced by subsequent movements, so the 
 next best indicator is the admission date.  When the admission date 
 doesn't exist on the admission record, VIA uses the default date of 
 1/1/1900.  By inference, this means that the admission part of the record 
 pair is most likely missing and the stay is invalid.  When the 1/1/1900 
 default date exists for a stay, NUMI will then invalidate the stay.
  
  
 13. I19096471FY18 - 2 different patient names displayed on NUMI History 
                     screen
     Child Tickets - INC0198769    INC0719462    INC0681409      
                     INC0589310      INC0646282
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 NUMI users see a Patient Name mismatch on the History screen between the 
 name displayed on the top portion of the screen (which is pulled from the 
 NUMI database) and the name displayed in the middle of the screen that 
 comes from VistA. This happens when the Patient Name on the Admission IEN 
 is changed in VistA after it is synchronized into NUMI. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 NUMI will invalidate the stay when the user clicks on the Patient Name on 
 the Patient Selection screen and will give the user the option to delete 
 the stay on the Patient Stay Administration screen.
  
  
 14. R10121514FY16 - NUMI / OQSV - Replace existing generic error  
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Replace generic errors with more specifics about the point of failure.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Updated error handling will inform users of specific points of failure 
 such as VIA/VistA connection failure etc.
  
  
 15. R17521721FY18- Consolidate configuration files
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 NUMI release 15.3.1 included extra .config files.  This in combination 
 with a bug in Visual Studio was generating files containing sensitive 
 data that would need to be encrypted on production and were flagged 
 during Fortify security scans.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This is primarily a build and deployment code maintenance task.  Post 
 build events were added to each project file to clean up extra 
 configuration files and a unit test framework that was only used for the 
 15.3.1 release was excluded from the project which removes the need for 
 the framework config file.
  
  
 16. INC0039104 - Fortify Code Quality Remediation for 15.5
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 NUMI requires code changes for the Code Quality review.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch implements the recommended changes for Fortify.
