    Remedy Overview:
    ================
  
    1.   INC000001013422
         Duplicates:  INC000000913837, INC00000913919,INC00001023077,
         INC00001022867
  
  
    Problem:
  
    When performing reviews, the reviewer copies a review originally
    entered in the system by another reviewer. The reviewer then makes
    necessary updates to the copied review and hits Final Save/Lock to
    Database to save the review in NUMI. Once NUMI saves the review, 
    the review table displayed towards the bottom of the Primary Review
    Summary screen does not reflect the correct reviewer name. But it
    is observed that the worklist and reports both reflect the reviewer
    name correctly.
  
    Resolution:
  
    Modify the [dbo].[usp_GetPatientReviewsByStay] stored procedure.  A
    review should be associated with the reviewer who created or last
    modified its content.
  
  
    2.   INC000001067065
  
    Problem:
  
    Within the NUMI Reports menu, the menu link for the Enhanced
    reports option is broken.  The link should point to:
    "https://vaww.rtp.portal.domain.ext/OQSV/10A4B/NUMI/enhanced/SitePages
    /Home.aspx."
  
    Resolution:
  
    The hyperlink has been repointed to the correct URL.
  
  
    3.   INC000001030549
         Duplicates:   INC000001013599, INC000001030384
  
    Problem:
  
    Reviews with General Medical VA custom subset do not fit in the
    standard viewing area of the Review Summary Screen and user has to
    scroll to view.  Review summary display is too wide. The user must
    scroll horizontally to read all the information whereas the text is
    usually wrapped to be readable on one window. This is a VA-specific
    criteria screen no-wrap display problem.
  
    Resolution:
  
    CERMe: Property file (css file) is corrected.
  
  
    4.   INC0000001078557
         Duplicates:  INC000001012651, INC000001013268, 
         INC000001023997, INC000001091341
  
    Problem:
  
    During review entry on a stay without ward/treating specialty,
    navigating from the CERMe screen to Continue Primary Review causes
    an error: A critical error has occurred.
  
    Resolution:
  
    If a movement does not include the ward and/or treating specialty
    and/or provider, NUMI should look back to the most recent previous
    movement(s) to fill in the missing field(s). It should find the
    last known ward, treating specialty, or provider, and assume the
    last known value is still valid and display it on the worklist and
    history screen and use it during review processing.  This will
    match the logic used in VistA to display current ward,treating
    specialty and provider and should prevent the NUMI errors.
