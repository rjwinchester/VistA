Description:
============

 VPS*1.0*4 is being released as part of a combined build which includes 
 VPS*1.0*4, VPS*1.0*5 and VPS*1.0*3.
  
 The VPS*1.0*4 (VPS 1*4) patch implements remote procedures (RPCs) in the 
 VPS namespace to provide additional patient demographic, enrollment and 
 eligibility, military service, and clinical reminders to VetLink kiosk 
 staff and veteran facing application modules.  The enhancements included 
 in the patch are:
  
         Additional patient demographic, enrollment and eligibility, 
         military service and clinical data elements are included in the
         VPS 1*4 demographic RPCs.  The data elements are bundled into
         existing RPCs which optimize the RPC payload and reduce the number
         of RPC calls that need to be made.
  
         RPCs to enable VetLink clinic staff users to print patient 
         specimen and wristband labels to secure clinic printers. 
  
         RPCs to provide system level clinical reminders currently due 
         for a patient when the patient checks-in.  These RPCs enable
         clinic staff to review and ensure clinical reminders are given to
         the patient at the earliest or most suitable point in the clinic
         workflow.
  
 The VPS *1.0*4 build installs RPCs required to provide Enhancement VPS 
 Kiosk 1*4 functionality.
