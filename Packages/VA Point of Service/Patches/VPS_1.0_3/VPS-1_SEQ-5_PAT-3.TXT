Description:
============

 VPS*1.0*3 is being released as part of a combined build which includes 
 VPS*1.0*4, VPS*1.0*5, and VPS*1.0*3.
  
 VHA has recently identified interactive kiosks as an innovation that will
 enable VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) to enhance services to veterans and 
 improve the efficiency of operations. Many Veterans Integrated Service
 Networks (VISNs), and VAMCs have already implemented kiosks in the past,
 and are currently using them to provide streamlined approaches for
 veterans to perform various tasks.
  
 The VA's vision for VA Point of Service (VPS) kiosk devices is to 
 streamline and improve patient clinical and administrative processes
 across the VA healthcare network, and to provide standard, easy-to-use
 capabilities for patients and employees to access and update information
 and perform business transactions through incremental releases. The VA's
 vision includes a modular and configurable solution that may be tailored
 to fit each facility's individual needs.
  
 The VPS Kiosk Application Server utilizes RPC Broker to make calls to the
 Remote Procedures (RPCs) residing on the VistA host. This patch delivers
 functionality that will support components delivered in VPS*1*1 and 
 VPS*1*2; and will deliver additional functionality to support the 
 Vetlink client.
  
  
 Following are the new RPCs included in VPS*1.0*3.
  
      VPS WRITE MRAR PDO
      VPS GET MRAR PDO
      VPS WRITE KIOSK PARAMETERS
      VPS GET LAST MRAR
      VPS UPDATE LAST MRAR TIU IEN
