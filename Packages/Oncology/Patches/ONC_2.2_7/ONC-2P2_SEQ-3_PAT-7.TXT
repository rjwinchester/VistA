Description:
============

 This patch contains enhancements that extend and improve the functionality
 of the VistA OncoTrax package.  The purpose of this release is to update
 the functionality as described below.
  
 All Data Dictionary modifications and additions have been reviewed and
 approved by the Data Base Administrator. 
  
 1. The Oncology software was not allowing entering/editing of inactive ICD9
 codes. Also not allowing entering, editing and printing of new ICD10 codes.
 To fix this issue, the SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS #1 - #10 and CAUSE OF DEATH fields
 needed to be modified.  The input and output transform screens and look-up
 routines for these fields have been corrected.
  
 2. The Oncology [AUTOMATIC CASEFINDING-PTF SEARCH] option needed to be updated.
 Ten more IDC-10 Secondary Diagnosis fields were added to the PTF (#45) file
 so our Casefinding Search option will now need to look for data in these
 newly added fields.
 
 3. The ACOS and State/VACCR data download options needed to be updated to
 correct an issue with the TEXT--USUAL OCCUPATION data item.  The options were
 sending and displaying a value of "UNKNOWN" for the TEXT--USUAL OCCUPATION item
 for every case.  The options [CREATE ACOS DATA DOWNLOAD], [CREATE A REPORT TO
 PREVIEW ACOS OUTPUT], [CREATE STATE/VACCR DATA DOWNLOAD] and [CREATE A REPORT
 TO PREVIEW STATE/VACCR OUTPUT] have been modified to correct this issue so the
 correct Occupation will be sent and displayed.
