Description:
============

 This patch contains enhancements that extend and improve the functionality
 of the VistA OncoTrax package.  The purpose of this release is to update
 the functionality as described below.
  
 All Data Dictionary modifications and additions have been reviewed and
 approved by the Data Base Administrator. 
  
  
         ******** I M P O R T A N T   N O T E ********
 =============================================================================
 DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS PATCH MUST BE COORDINATED WITH THE UPDATE OF THE
 EDITS METAFILES ON THE VHAWASONC2 ONC SERVER, THE PATCH SHOULD BE INSTALLED
 AS CLOSE TO PATCH RELEASE AS POSSIBLE.  THE PATCH WILL HAVE A NORMAL 30-DAY
 COMPLIANCE DATE, BUT ONCE THE PATCH IS RELEASED THE METAFILES WILL BE UPDATED
 AND IT IS BEST TO STAY IN SYNC.  ABSTRACTS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE COMPLETED
 UNTIL THE PATCH IS INSTALLED.  THE PACKAGE WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE BUT
 REGISTRARS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE CASES UNTIL THE PATCH IS INSTALLED,
 JEOPARDIZING THE VACCR & COC'S ABSTRACTING COMPLIANCE STANDARDS.
 =============================================================================
  
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) Addressed 
 ==========================
 1071115 - issue with the "First Course of Treatment"  
  
 1. Add Patient ICN (Integration Control Number) to the Veteran's Affairs
 Central Cancer Registry (VACCR) extract
 The Master Veterans Index (MVI) requires additional identifiers
 to link to a unique patient.  It will be used as part of the Corporate
 Data Warehouse (CDW) linkage at the Austin Information Technology
 Center (AITC).  The Integration Control Number (ICN) is based on
 ASTM-E-1714 format of 16 digits, a delimiter character, plus 6 checksum
 digits for a total length of 23 characters.  The Patient ICN and Checksum
 from the PATIENT (#2) file will be added to the VACCR Extract at position
 72 thru 94.
  
 2. Create a new EDITS Modifications module
 A new module will be added as selection #8 under the AI-Complete
 Abstract [ONCO ABSTRACT-ENTER/EDIT] and EE-Abstract Edit Primary [ONCO
 ABSTRACT-EDIT] options.  The new module will allow registrars to edit
 the Address at DX (Diagnosis) and Address Current sets of fields as well
 as the Date Flag fields.  These should only be edited if the Abstract has
 an EDIT  which cannot be cleared.
  
 3. Allow entry of future dates to be selected for QA Date in abstract 
 Entry of future dates in the QA DATE (#165.5, 64) field will now be
 allowed.  This will allow the field to be utilized as a 'check back'
 date to look for pending treatments. 
  
 4. Add duplicate Acc/Seq Number check and new option to find duplicates
 When a new abstract is created there will now be a check on the ACC/SEQ
 NUMBER (#165.5, .061) field to ensure that there are no duplicate
 Accession/Sequence numbers already in the system.  There is also a new
 option called SQ-Find Duplicate Acc/Seq Numbers [ONCO UTIL-FIND DUP
 ACCSEQ] option on the UTL-Utility Options [ONCO UTIL MENU] menu which
 will check for any existing duplicates in the system.  
  
 5. Add new computed field for First Course of Treatment Date minus
 Diagnosis Date
 A new computed field called FIRST TREATMENT DT-DATE DX (#165.5, 49.1)
 was created which is derived by calculating the First Course of Treatment
 Date minus the Diagnosis Date. This can be used in the CPR-Print Custom
 Reports [ONCO ANNUAL-CUSTOM PRINT] and other reports to show the number
 of days from DATE DX (#165.5, 3) to FIRST COURSE OF TREATMENT (#165.5, 49).
  
 6. Remove auto-TNM staging of cases
 Due to significant changes from AJCC (American Joint Commission on Cancer)
 on the T, N, M staging algorithms, the code to automatically calculate the
 Clinical Stage and Pathologic Stage Grouping fields will be removed. The
 staging would become much too unwieldy and difficult to maintain, so the
 registrars will now be able to enter the staging directly. 
  
 7. Screen APPENDIX (C18.1) cases from Create RQRS Extract report option
 The Create RQRS Extract [ONCO RQRS EXTRACT] option is for Colon, Rectum
 and Breast cases only: C18.0, C18.2-C18.9, C20.9 and C50.0 - C50.9. The
 code for this option was checking by range but was including C18.1
 (Appendix cases) in the range.  This is fixed by screening out the C18.1
 cases from the RQRS Extract when selecting by DATE DX.  
  
 8. Add a new selection to the Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) field
 A new code for selection by the registrar was needed for the FECAL
 OCCULT BLOOD TEST (#165.5, 181) field.  The new selection is:
 5 - FIT Test.
  
 9. Remove Date Of No Treatment check on Scope Of LN Surgery Date
 The SCOPE OF LN SURGERY DATE (#165.51, 38) sub-field under the SUBSEQUENT
 COURSE OF TREATMENT (#165.5, 60) multiple had a check on the DATE OF NO
 TREATMENT (#165.5, 124) field.  If there was a date entered for that field
 then the user would not be allowed to enter anything for SCOPE OF LN SURG
 DATE; they would receive a message stating that it was not allowed unless
 the DATE OF NO TREATMENT is deleted.  This was not correct, so the check
 has been removed. 
  
 10. Update column header in List Topography Codes by Site Group option
 The column header for Histology in the List Topography Codes by Site Group
 [ONCO UTIL-TOPOG BY SITEGRP] option was ICDO-2, but the correct heading
 should be ICDO-3.  The data is unchanged in this report but the column
 header has been corrected.
  
 11. Modify Create RQRS Extract option
 An error in how the Create RQRS Extract [ONCO RQRS EXTRACT] option pulls
 cases was discovered.  When running the report by DATE CASE LAST CHANGED
 (#165.5, 198) the report was pulling cases back to reference year.  It
 should only go back to 1/1/2008.  Another search criterion was added to
 disregard any primaries with diagnosis prior to 2008.
  
 12. Exclude Class of Case '00' cases from 2 Follow-up reports
 Under the Follow Up Functions [ONCO FOLLOWUP MENU] menu the Print Due
 Follow-up List by Month Due [ONCO FOLLOWUP-DUE LIST] and Print Delinquent
 (LTF) List [ONCO FOLLOWUP-DELINQUENT LIST] report options needed to exclude
 cases with Class of Case = '00'.  These reports were previously excluding
 cases with Class of Case of 30 & greater, now they will also exclude cases
 with '00'. 
  
 13. Fix for EDITS that cannot be cleared for foreign addresses
 This patch will fix the extracts for patients with foreign addresses.
 Patients with a foreign address (Canada, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico etc)
 were throwing EDITS for the following extract items: 
 "Addr Current -- Country", "Addr Current -- State", "Addr at DX -- Country"
 and "Addr at DX -- Country".  This patch will fix the problems with these
 foreign address EDITS.  Also, the registrar will now be able to over-ride
 these fields in case it is ever necessary to clear an EDIT, as described
 in item #2 above for the new module to over-ride EDIT fields.
  
 14. Remove default stuffing for Surg Dx/Staging Proc @Fac fields
 The SURG DX/STAGING PROC @FAC (#165.5, 58.4) and SURG DX/STAGING PROC
 @FAC DATE (#165.5, 58.5) fields were being stuffed but due to too many
 variables in Class of Case/Biopsy it is better to not stuff the fields
 and leave to the discretion of the registrar.  This patch removes the
 stuffing of those fields.
  
 15. Fix SSF defaults for Kidney (C64.9) & Gum, Lower (C03.1 and C06.2) cases
 a. Kidney primaries (not sarcoma) were defaulting SSF2 (#165.5, 44.2) and
 SSF3 (#165.5, 44.3) to 998.  This was incorrect; the default stuffing
 should be for SSF5 (#165.5, 44.5) and SS7 (#165.5, 44.7). 
 b. Also Gum, Lower (C03.1 and C06.2) cases were incorrectly defaulting
 SSF11 (#165.5, 44.11) to 988.
 This patch will correct these SSF values.
  
 16. Fix staging for Appendix (C18.1), carcinoid (8243/3) cases
 Appendix cases with carcinoid (Histology = 8243/n) were dropping out of
 the TNM staging with the message "No TNM coding/staging is available for
 carcinoid tumors of the appendix."  This was incorrect, as TNM staging
 should be available for these cases.  This patch addresses the issue by
 not dropping out of the staging code allowing these cases to be staged. 
  
 17. Update of look-up display for Recurrence/Sub TX Follow-up option
 If a patient selected in the Recurrence/Sub TX Follow-up [ONCO FOLLOWUP-
 RECURRENCE] option had multiple primaries, the primaries were listed and
 the PRIMARY SITE (#165.5, 20) and PATIENT NAME (#165.5, .02) were
 displayed.  This patch will add the TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE (#165.5, 71)
 field so that it is displayed alongside Primary Site and Patient Name.
  
 18. Modify the Recurrence Date Flag
 If there is any DATE OF FIRST RECURRENCE (#165.5, 70) entered, then the
 Recurrence Date--1st Flag in the extract should be NULL.  Previously the
 code was first checking if the TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE (#165.5, 71) field
 was "Never disease free" or "None, disease free", and if so it was setting
 the flag to "11".  This will be fixed in this patch.  
  
 19. Remove COMORBIDITY codes from NAACCR State Record Layout Utility
 The Comorbidity codes are only collected by the National Cancer DataBase
 (NCDB).  This patch will keep the Comorbidity codes in the North American
 Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) record layout, but will
 transmit fields as either blank or 99990.
  
 20. Remove some inter-field edit checks for treatment codes
 The inter-field edit checks invoked when a case is completed contained
 checks for 8's or 88/88/8888 in treatment and treatment date fields.  This
 check would prevent the cases from being completed.  These particular
 checks are obsolete and will be removed.
  
 21. NAACCR v15 Record Layout Implementation plus Data Conversions
 The new NAACCR v15 record layout requires changes to be made to the Oncology
 abstract fields and extract layout to stay in compliance.
 The changes include new items (Survival Data items), several changed data
 items and the Prostate Grade and Hematopoietic data conversions.
