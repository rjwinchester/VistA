 1. ACCESSION NUMBER LOOK-UP
 This release adds the ability to look-up Patient Abstracts by the 
 Accession Number from various options under the "ABSTRACTING/PRINTING" 
 menu.  These options will now allow look-up by Accession Number: 
 [Abstract Edit Primary], [Patient Summary], [Print Abstract QA (80c)], 
 [Print Abstract-Extended (80c)], [Print Complete Abstract (132c)] and the 
 separate screens under the [Abstract Screens Menu].
 ROUTINE: ONCOGEN 
  
 2. STATE DATA EXTRACT
 REMEDY TICKET #: 842908
 This release addresses an issue in Patch 57, which exported an incorrect 
 entry in the State Data Extract of the Oncology Data Extract Format 
 (#160.16) file.  The field UNUSUAL FOLLOW-UP METHOD was exported with the 
 LENGTH field = 1 and ENDING POSITION = 2290.  This problem pushed the 
 STATE Extract off by one character resulting in an incorrect format which 
 would be rejected.  This field should have had the LENGTH field = 2 and 
 the ENDING POSITION = 2291.  The problem was only in the STATE EXTRACT; 
 the NCDB EXTRACT and VACCR EXTRACT were not affected.
 FILE: Oncology Data Extract Format (#160.16):
 ^ONCO(160.16,2,"FIELD",206,0)="2290^2^2291^Unusual Follow-Up Method"
  
 3. DATE OF SURGICAL DISCHARGE FIELD PLACEMENT
 This release renames the DATE OF SURGICAL DISCHARGE (#435) field in the 
 Oncology Primary (#165.5) file to DATE MOST DEFINITIVE SURG DIS; it also 
 changes the placement of that field in the Complete Abstract to follow 
 the MOST DEFINITIVE SURG DATE (#50) field.
 INPUT TEMPLATE: [ONCO ABSTRACT-I]FILE ^DD: Oncology Primary (#165.5), 
 field #435
  
 4. DATE FLAG FIELDS
 This release adds functionality to allow registrars to edit the DATE FLAG 
 fields; previously these fields were stuffed and not editable.  This will 
 allow registrars to fix errors in the DATE FLAG fields.
 INPUT TEMPLATE: [ONCO ABSTRACT - I]
 FILE ^DD: Oncology Primary (#165.5), new fields #999.1 - #999.25
  
 5. FIX ERROR IN "PRINT QA/MULTIPLE ABSTRACT" OPTION
 This option was incorrectly skipping many cases due to an earlier 
 conversion of the Class of Case field.  This option was only selecting 
 cases with Class of Case ="00" or "10" due to the way the code was 
 written based on the old Class of Case values.  This was fixed by getting 
 the correct Class of Case values of "00" thru "22" based on the newly 
 converted values.
  
 6. APPROACH FIELD
 This release adds code to default the value of the APPROACH (#234) field 
 of the Oncology Primary (#165.5) file to "0" if the SURG OF PRIM @FAC 
 (#58.7) field is equal to "00".
 INPUT TEMPLATE: [ONCO ABSTRACT-I]
  
 7. COLON AND LUNG PERFORMANCE MEASURES
 Rename the TYPE OF RADIATION (#262) field of the Oncology Primary 
 (#165.5) file to MULTIMODALITY RADIATION TYPE and add "multimodality" 
 text to the "0" code.
 FILE ^DD: Oncology Primary (#165.5), field #262
 ROUTINES: ONCPMC, ONCPML
  
 8. FOLLOW-UP CALCULATIONS
 This release provides modifications to the way the Follow-up rate is 
 calculated to exclude CLASS OF CASE "00" and Patients older than 100.
 The RS follow-up rate should exclude ALL Class of Case "00" and Patients 
 aged >=100 - not just for 2006 cases and forward:
  
 Example:
    Total patients from registry reference date    12358       100%
  
     1.  Less benign/borderline cases                 -    67 
     2.  Less Carcinoma in situ cervix cases          -     0 
     3.  Less in situ/localized basal and squamous    -     4 
         cell carcinoma of skin cases     " 
     4.  Less foreign residents                       -     1 
     5.  Less non-analytic cases                      -  1842 
     6.  Less (ALL) Class of Case 00 case             -   291 
     7.  Less (ALL) Patient Age 100+ case             -     0 
  
          SUBTOTAL CASES = ANALYTIC CASES           (A) 10153       100%
          Class of Case 00-22
  
 9. DATE LAST CONTACT FIELD
 This release changes the data type of the DATE LAST CONTACT field (#200) in
 the Oncology Primary (#165.5) file from 'free text' data type to 'date' data
 type, to assist in sorting reports by this field.  
  
 10. SSF4 FIELD FOR PROSTATE CASES
 In this release, for cases with a DATE DX >2010, the SSF4 (#44.4) field of
 the Oncology Primary (#165.5,) file will default to a value of "988".
 INPUT TEMPLATE: [ONCO ABSTRACT-I]
  
 11. ADDITIONS TO SUBSEQUENT COURSE OF TREATMENT MULTIPLE
 This release adds several new fields to the SUBSEQUENT COURSE OF 
 TREATMENT (#165.51) multiple: SCOPE OF LN SURGERY DATE (#38), SURGICAL 
 PROC/OTHER SITE DATE (#39), METS SITE RESECTED (#40), METS SITE RESECTED 
 DATE (#41) and PALLIATIVE CARE (#42).

 14. MAILMAN SERVER FUNCTIONALITY FOR AUTOMATIC UPDATES
 This release provides MailMan server functionality for automatic updates 
 and possible download of data.  This is an Oncology server option that 
 can only be initiated by a user entered in the Oncology Site Parameter 
 file (#160.1).  The following functionalities are being provided by this 
 option:
  
        a. Allows programmer to update file #160.16 using a MailMan
 message.
        b. Allows server users to initiate a MailMan message to a 
 particular site and a particular report will be created and mailed to 
 valid recipients entered in file 160.1.  Reports that can be generated 
 using this function are Registry and Timeliness.
        c. Allows programmers to update/correct the server IP address in 
 the Oncology Site Parameter file (#160.1).
  
 15. SURGICAL APPROACH FIELD REQUIRED FOR EDITS
 The "RX Hosp--Surg App 2010" Data Item, derived from the SURG APP 2010 
 (#165.5,234) field was not being required and not being exported in the 
 Data Extracts.  This item will be fixed by requiring this field for 
 primaries with DATE DX > 2009 and will be included in the Data Extracts.
  
 16. CREATE RQRS EXTRACT OPTION
 The "RQRS   Create RQRS extract" option was modified to ignore abstracts 
 with Class of Case greater than "22".
  
 17. FACILITY FILE NAME CHANGE
 "West Haven" facility was changed to "Connecticut HCS" in Facility File 
 (#160.19).
 ROUTINE: ONC2PS01
 DATA: ^ONCO(160.19,
  
 18. FIX ERROR IN GIST 7TH EDITION STAGING
 Item #15 from patch ONC*2.11*56 fixed an issue for CS Schema 
 Discriminator values for G-E Junction Staging.  However, the code fix was 
 added before the GIST staging code which created a problem because it was 
 skipping the GIST staging code.  This issue was fixed by moving the code 
 from Patch 56 to after the GIST staging code.
 ROUTINE: ONCOTN
  
 19. FIX ERROR IN COMMON BILE DUCT 7TH EDITION STAGING
 Common Bile Duct cases with a discriminator value of "040" were deriving 
 a strange Stage value of "SB".  This was due to a typo in the code.  The 
 code was corrected so these are now "2B".
 ROUTINE: ONCSG1A
  
 20. PROBLEMS WITH 7TH EDITION STAGING OF COLORECTAL CASES
 There was an issue with the 7th Edition staging for colon/rectum cases 
 coded T4a N2 M0 in which these were deriving a Clinical or Pathologic 
 Stage Group of "99".  These should derive Stage Group values of "3C".  
 This issue was corrected by fixing the staging logic.There was also a 
 typo in the code for Colorectal Staging which was causing cases coded T2 
 N2b M0 to incorrectly derive a Stage value of "99".  This was fixed as 
 well.
 ROUTINE: ONCSG1
  
 21. CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT (#164.18) FILE UPDATE
 Six  new values were added to the Chemotherapeutic Agent (#164.18) file.  
 These new entries are now selectable choices in the Chemotherapeutic 
 Agent 1-5 fields in the Abstract Edit Options.  The 6 new values are:  
 AFINITOR, DESATINIB, PRALATREXATE, AXITINIB, RUXOLITINIB, PAZOPANIB.
 ROUTINE: ONC2PS01
 DATA: ^ONCO(164.18,
  
 22. TWO NEW ENTRIES ADDED TO OTHER STAGING FOR ONCOLOGY (#164.3) FILE
 Two new values were added to the Other Staging for Oncology (#164.3) 
 file: BCLC and MELD.  Both of these values were added to the 
 Hepatocellular Carcinoma (Liver) site group.
 ROUTINE: ONC2PS01
 DATA: ^ONCO(164.3
  
 23. NEW ABSTRACTOR/REGISTRAR SITE PARAMETER
 A new multiple  field was added to the ONCOLOGY SITE PARAMETERS (#160.16) 
 file, called ABSTRACTOR/REGISTRAR.  This field will hold a unique, 
 specific 3 digit number that can be assigned to each specific 
 abstractor/registrar at each VAMC site.  Each site can control this 
 number at a local level, by using the [TR Define Tumor Registry 
 Parameters] option of the Utility Options menu.  The new field will be 
 displayed in column 742, "Abstracted By" field.  If the Abstractor has 
 not been assigned a 3-Digit State Number then their initials will be used 
 from file #200; if they do not have anything in the Initials field then 
 the field will default to "999". 
  
 24. OCULAR LYMPHOMA STAGING ISSUE
 There was an issue in the staging code for Ocular Lymphoma primaries 
 where the Clinical or Pathologic M-Code value of NULL was causing an 
 erroneous value to be calculated for the corresponding Clinical or 
 Pathologic Stage Group.  This would also cause an EDITS reject error.  
 The problem was fixed by allowing a NULL M-code value to not skip out of 
 the rest of the staging code for these types of primaries and continue, 
 which results in the correct stage group being assigned.
 ROUTINE: ONCOTN
  
 25. BREAST PRIMARY STAGING ISSUE
 There was an issue in the staging code for Breast Primaries where the 
 Pathologic N-Code: value was causing an error in Collaborative Staging 
 and EDITS.  This was due to typos in the Help and Input Transform where 
 the code was displaying and checking for O's instead of correctly 
 checking for or displaying zeroes.
 ROUTINE: ONC2PS01
 DATA: ^ONCO(160.16,,"FIELD,90 and ^ONCO(164.33,23
  
 26. CANADIAN PROVINCES AND COUNTRY CODES
  
 REMEDY TICKET #: 890026
 There was a problem in several extract items where a country code outside 
 of the U.S. would result in a blank being sent which caused an EDITS 
 error and not allow the abstract to be completed.  The extract items are 
 "Address at DX--Country", "Followup Contact--Country", "Current 
 Address--Country".  The code was modified to try to get the correct 
 country code and if it cannot be determined then the values of these 
 extract items will be defaulted to a value of "ZZU" which will pass
 edits and not cause an error.
  
 27. METS AT DX (CS) FIELD STUFFING
 An issue was identified in the Abstract Enter/Edit option, where the 
 registrar enters "98" (Not Applicable) for the METS AT DX (CS) (#165.5, 
 34.3) field, and the METS AT DX-BONE (#165.5,34.31), METS AT DX-BRAIN 
 (#165.5,34.32), METS AT DX-LIVER (#165.5,34.33) and METS AT DX-LUNG 
 (#165.5,34.34) fields were being stuffed with the value of 0 (None).  
 These fields should be stuffed with the value of 8 (Not Applicable).  The 
 [ONCO ABSTRACT-I] Input template was modified to address this issue.  
 Existing cases will be checked and converted to the correct value if 
 necessary.
 ROUTINE: ONC2PS01
 INPUT TEMPLATE: [ONCO ABSTRACT-I]
  
 28. SITE SPECIFIC FACTORS FOR TESTIS SCHEMA COLLABORATIVE STAGING ISSUE
 There was an issue with the Site Specific Factors for Testis Primaries 
 where the SSF11 value was not being defaulted to a value of 988, but the 
 SSF12-SSF16 values were being defaulted to 988.  The code was modified to 
 reverse this, so that SSF11 is defaulted to 988 and SSF12-SSF16 values 
 are not.
 ROUTINE: ONCCS3
  
 29. MODIFICATIONS FOR ABSTRACT TO FLOW DIRECTLY TO RECURRENCE/SUB TX FOLLOW-UP
 The [AI  Complete Abstract] and [EE  ABSTRACT EDIT PRIMARY] options have 
 been modified so that upon completion of the Abstract (right after the 
 ABSTRACT STATUS field the code will go directly to the [Recurrence/Sub Tx 
 Follow-up] module after the [Post/Edit Follow-up] module.  Prior to this 
 change the user would have to exit out of the Abstract Option(s) and then 
 navigate over to the Follow-Up Functions menu to access the Recurrence 
 fields.  In addition, when  the ^PF [Post/Edit Follow-up] option is 
 called directly, at the end it will flow to the ^RF [Recurrence/Sub Tx 
 Follow-up] module, and vice versa.

 30. PROBLEM WITH USERS BEING ABLE TO SELECT INACTIVE ICD-10 CODES
 REMEDY TICKET #: 914869
 There was an issue in which users were able to select ICD-10 codes that 
 are inactive.  The ICD-10 codes exist but are INACTIVE until they become 
 ACTIVE in October 2014.  Usually Oncology does not screen INACTIVE codes 
 because Registrars may be entering data for an old case with an ICD code 
 that was ACTIVE at the time of DX but is now INACTIVE.  In this case a 
 screen was added to screen out INACTIVE codes so that ICD-10 codes may 
 not be selected. If this is problematic, the screen could be removed 
 after ICD-10 is ACTIVE.
 ROUTINE: ONCFUNC
  
 31. PROBLEM WITH FILEMAN REPORT UNABLE TO PRINT ONCOLOGY FIELDS ON SINGLE LINE
 There was an issue with the output transform for several fields in the 
 ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5) file, which was preventing the fields from 
 printing correctly on Fileman or Custom ONCOLOGY reports.  The output 
 transform was forcing a new line, so that the fields could not all print 
 on a single line.  The fields in question are SURGICAL DX/STAGING PROC 
 (#58.1), SURGICAL DX/STAGING PROC DATE (#58.3), SURG DX/STAGING PROC @FAC 
 (#58.4) and SURGERY OF PRIMARY (F) (#58.6).  The output transforms have 
 been modified to fix this issue.
 ROUTINE: ONCODSR.
  
 32. PROBLEM WITH ENTENSION FIELD VALUES FOR LACRIMAL GLAND SITES
 There was an issue with the Extension field values when editing abstracts 
 for Lacrimal Gland (C69.5) sites.  The Extension field was displaying 2 
 codes (#70 and #80) both with the identical text of "Adjacent Bone".  
 This was not correct, the text for code 80 should have been "Further 
 contiguous extension".  This item is corrected by fixing the DESCRIPTION 
 (#.01) field of the CODE/DESCRIPTION (#4) multiple field in the SEER CODE 
 SET (#164.5) File.  The post-init routine for this patch will update this 
 field/sub-file when the patch is installed.
 ROUTINE: ONC2PS01
  
 33. COLLABORATIVE STAGING v02.05
 This release will implement CS version 0205. The necessary data 
 conversions will be performed when the patch is installed.

 ROUTINE: ONCCSRS,ONC2PS01
  
 34. NAACCR (NORTH AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF CENTRAL CANCER REGISTRIES) v14 RECORD LAYOUT 
 This patch will include implementation of the new NAACCR Record Layout v14.  
  
 35. NAACCR v14 EDITS METAFILE
 This release will implement the use of the new v14 EDITS metafile when
 completing Abstracts.
  
 36. LYMPHATIC VESSEL INVASION (L)
 The value of "X" was removed from the set of code values for the 
 LYMPHATIC VESSEL INVASION (L) field (#149) of the Oncology Primary 
 (#165.5) file.  The new codes 8 and 9 were added.   All existing 
 primaries with value of "X" will be converted to 8 or 9 depending on the 
 Histology data.

 37. LANGERHANS CELL HISTIOCYTOSIS, NOS HISTOLOGY UPDATE
 The ICD-O-3 MORPHOLOGY (#169.3) file had two Histology entries (#97511 
 and #97513) with the identical name of LANGERHANS CELL HISTIOCYTOSIS, NOS, 
 except that the 97513 entry had (9751/1) appended to the end.  The 97511 
 value is obsolete after 2010, so the 97513 value now has the  "(9751/1)" 
 removed from the name and the 97511 has "(<2010 CASES)" appended to the 
 text.

 38. TYPE OF RECURRENCE, DISTANT SITE 1-3 AND REC DATE-1ST FLAG DEFAULTS
 In the [Recurrence/Sub TX Follow-up] option the TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE, 
 DISTANT SITE 1, DISTANT SITE 2, DISTANT SITE 3 and REC DATE-1ST FLAG 
 fields will be set to default values based on the value of the CANCER 
 STATUS field value within the TUMOR STATUS multiple.  If there is an 
 existing value in the TYPE OF FIRST RECURRENCE field, then this value 
 will be retained and the defaults will not be set.
 INPUT TEMPLATE: [ONCO RECURRENCE FOLLOWUP]
 ROUTINE: ONCOAIF
  
 39. MERKEL CELL 7TH EDITION STAGING
 There was a problem with staging for Merkel Cell cases in which a TNM of 
 T1, N1a, M0 was computing a Clinical Stage Group of 99 (Unknown).  This 
 was because the N-code of N1a was not in the staging table so these were 
 staging as unknown.  The issue is fixed and these cases will be staged to 
 "IIIA".
 ROUTINE: ONCSG3
  
 40. READMISSION W/I 30 DAYS/SURG FIELD IN ABSTRACT
 The READMISSION W/I 30 DAYS/SURG (#165.5, #14) field needed to be moved 
 within the Abstract Edit options.  This field is related to the Most 
 Definitive Surgery and not the First Surgical Procedure so the field was 
 moved to the correct spot in the Abstract.
 INPUT TEMPLATE: [ONCO ABSTRACT-I]
  
 41. SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS 1-10 FIELDS
 The SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS 1-10 FIELDS (#160, #25.91-#25.9901) will be added 
 to the 3 Oncology Extract Layouts and the fields will be editable (with 
 ICD-10 activation) in the [Complete Abstract] option, in the Patient Data 
 section following the COMORBIDITY/COMPLICATION 1-10 fields.
 ROUTINES: ONCACDU1, ONCFUNC, ONCOAIP, ONCPAT, ONCPDI
  
 42. STAGING FOR WALDENSTROM CASES
 The staging code for Waldenstrom cases (Primary Site C42.0 & Histology 
 9761/3) were incorrectly skipping over the Extension and Lymph Node 
 (#165.5, #30 & #31) fields.  These special cases needed code in the Input 
 Transform and Help to get the correct Extension and Lymph Node field 
 values and allow editing.
