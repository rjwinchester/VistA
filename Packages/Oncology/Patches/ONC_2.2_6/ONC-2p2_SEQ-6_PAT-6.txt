 Description:
 ===========
  
 This patch contains enhancements that extend and improve the functionality
 of the VistA OncoTrax package.  The purpose of this release is to update
 the functionality as described below.
  
 All Data Dictionary modifications and additions have been reviewed and
 approved by the Data Base Administrator. 
  
 1. Software Changes for NAACCR Vol II v2016
 A. Addition of Clinical and Pathologic Indicators to the AJCC TNM fields
 Clinical and Pathologic indicators have been added to the allowable values
 for the CLINICAL T (#165.5, #37.1), CLINICAL N (#165.5, #37.2), CLINICAL
 M (#165.5, #37.3), PATHOLOGIC T (#165.5, #85), PATHOLOGIC N (#165.5, #86),
 PATHOLOGIC M (#165.5, #87) fields.  The indicators have been added by
 modifying the existing values for the individual Clinical and Pathologic T, N,
 M data items.  All the existing data in these 6 fields in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY
 (#165.5) file have been converted according to the NAACCR Implementation
 Guidelines conversion crosswalk [Appendix C].  The Help Text and Input/Output
 Transforms have also been modified to correspond to the new values so users
 may use the new values when creating or editing abstracts. Finally, a new
 validity check option has been created and added to the "Utility Options"
 [ONCO UTIL MENU] menu; the new validity check option is called "Check
 Validity of TNM Field Values" [ONCO ABSTRACT-VALID TNM].
  
 B. Expansion of values for Clinical and Pathologic Staged By fields
 The STAGED BY (CLINICAL) (#165.5, #19) and STAGED BY (PATHOLOGIC)
 (#165.5 ,#89) field values have been expanded and modified.  The allowable
 codes have been expanded from 1 digit to 2 digits and the code values have
 been modified.  All the existing data in these 2 fields in the ONCOLOGY
 PRIMARY (#165.5) file have been converted according to the NAACCR
 Implementation guidelines conversion crosswalk [Appendix A].  The Help
 Text and Input/Output transforms have been modified to correspond to
 the new codes/values so users may use the new values when creating
 or editing abstracts.
  
 C. Replacement of term "Hermaphrodite"
 A value for the SEX (#160, #10) field on the ONCOLOGY PATIENT (#160) file
 has been modified.  The outdated term "Hermaphrodite" has been replaced
 by "Other (intersex, disorders of sexual development/DSD)".
  
 D. Addition of 2 new METS AT DX fields
 Two new fields have been added to the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5) file:
 METS AT DX-DISTANT LN (#165.5, #34.35) and METS AT DX-OTHER (#165.5,
 #34.36).  These 2 new fields have been added to the Oncology Abstract so
 that they are editable when creating or modifying an abstract in the EE
 "Abstract Edit Primary" [ONCO ABSTRACT-EDIT] and AI "Complete Abstract"
 [ONCO ABSTRACT-ENTER/EDIT].  The 2 fields have also been added to the
 displays within the Abstract and when printing an Abstract using the PA
 "Print Complete Abstract (132c)" [ONCO ABSTRACT-PRINT/EO132] option.
 Also, for 2016+ cases if the METS AT DX (CS) field is "00" or "98"
 the appropriate stuffing for all 6 METS AT DX fields has been removed
 and users may enter values for these fields.  For cases before 2016 the
 stuffing remains as it was.
  
 E. Addition of 3 new Tumor Size fields
 Three new fields have been added to the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY (#165.5) file:
 TUMOR SIZE CLINICAL (#165.5, #29.4), TUMOR SIZE PATHOLOGIC (#165.5,
 #29.5) and TUMOR SIZE SUMMARY (#165.5, #29.3).  These 3 new fields have
 been added to the Oncology Abstract so that they are editable when creating or
 modifying an abstract in the EE "Abstract Edit Primary" [ONCO ABSTRACT-EDIT]
 and AI "Complete Abstract" [ONCO ABSTRACT-ENTER/EDIT].  For 2016 and later
 cases the 3 new fields will be displayed and editable instead of the existing
 TUMOR SIZE (#29) field.  For cases prior to 2016, the old TUMOR SIZE (#29)
 field will still be used instead of the 3 new fields.  The 3 new fields have
 also been added to the displays within the Abstract and when printing an
 Abstract using the PA "Print Complete Abstract (132c)"
 [ONCO ABSTRACT-PRINT/EO132] option.
  
 F. New EDITS in Standards Vol II, Version 16 Metafile
 The new Standards Volume II, version 16 metafile includes new edits for the
 new and modified data items.  The edits and edit sets are consistent with the
 reporting requirements as specified in the NAACCR 2016 Implementation
 Guidelines as specified by CoC, NPCR, SEER and CCCR.
  
 G. Record Layout Changes
 The overall record layout remains the same length.  Column spaces for some
 data items have been moved in the record layout to accommodate the new
 and expanded data items.
  
 H. Set Default DERIVED CS field values BLANK for NCDB, NAACCR Stat
  and VACCR extracts
 Per the NCDB (National Cancer Database) all 2016 and later cases using
 NAACCR v16 edits will require all CS (Collaborative Stage) input data items
 to be BLANK.  Therefore all CS input data items will be set to blank for the
 NCDB Extract in the "Create ACOS Data Download" [ONCO #SITE-CREATE
 ACOS DISC] option and the NAACCR State/VACCR Extracts in the "Create
 State/VACCR Data Download" [ONCO #STATE DATA DISC] option. 
  
 2. Removal of TUMOR SIZE field for cases diagnosed 2004 or later in
 VACCR extract and Abstract Edit
 The EOD-TUMOR SIZE (item #780) was retired and can be removed from the record
 layout and VACCR data extract for 2004+ diagnosis years.  The EOD-TUMOR SIZE
 item will be removed from the VACCR data extract in the "Create State/VACCR
 Data Download" [ONCO #STATE DATA DISC] option.  Additionally the corresponding
 TUMOR SIZE (#165.5, #29) field will be removed from the Abstract Primary Edit
 option for 2016 and later cases and be replaced by TUMOR SIZE CLINICAL (#165.5,
 #29.4), TUMOR SIZE PATHOLOGIC  (#165.5, #29.5) and TUMOR SIZE SUMMARY (#165.5,
 #29.3) fields. 
  
 3. EDITS errors for Surgery of Primary (R) fields though Abstract
 Fields values are correct
 Several EDITS errors were being returned when trying to complete old
 (1998-2002) Leukemia (C42.1) cases.  If the case had a DATE OF NO
 TREATMENT (#165.5, #124) value, then when completing the case, the
 EDITS would return several errors indicating that the Surgery of Primary (R)
 ROADS values were incorrectly "98" or "Blank" even though the field values
 in the abstract were correctly "00".  This problem was traced back to a fix
 for another issue which was made in ITEM #18 of Patch ONC*2.2*5.  The fix
 for that issue caused this strange residual EDITS error; the error has been
 fixed in this patch.
  
 4. TUMOR SIZE (#165.5, #29) field removed from Required Fields to complete
 an abstract
 For 2016 and later cases the TUMOR SIZE field will be removed from the list
 of required fields to complete an abstract.  For 2016 and later cases the TUMOR
 SIZE CLINICAL (#165.5, #29.4), TUMOR SIZE PATHOLOGIC  (#165.5, #29.5) and TUMOR
 SIZE SUMMARY (#165, #29.3) fields will replace the old TUMOR SIZE field.  The
 new fields do not need to be added to the list of required fields.
  
 5. VACCR Extract records will now send an "M" as the Record Type
 for Updated Cases
 For records in the VACCR Extract, if the case is an 'update' to an already
 'completed' case according to the VACCR EXTRACT INDICATOR (#165.5,
 #282) field, the Record Type will now be set to "M".  Previously the Record
 Type was "A" for all cases. .  In addition, if a FOLLOW-UP is done for a
 patient this will trigger sending ALL "Completed" primary abstracts for the
 patient through the EDITS server, rather than just one specific  abstract.
  
 6. New Record Layout selection (SEER-Surveillance, Epidemiology
 and End Results Program)
 For the 'Create a report to preview State/VACCR output' [ONCO #STATE
 DATA REPORT] and 'Create State/VACCR Data Download' {ONCO #STATE
 DATA DISK} options there is a new available record layout for selection:
 SEER State Record Layout v16.0.  The new SEER State Record Layout will
 include all Collaborative Stage fields; this is required since some  VA
 Facilities are in SEER states and need to have this record layout available.
  
 7. Add 8 allowable codes to Clinical and Pathologic Stage groups for Lymphoma
 cases
 Due to a new 2016 EDIT for SSF2/TNM Stage Group, 8 codes had to be added to the
 allowable codes for the Clinical Stage Group (#165.5, #38) and Pathologic Stage
 Group (#165.5, #88) fields for Lymphoma cases.  The values IA, IB, IIA, IIB,
 IIIA, IIIB, IVA and IVB were added so that they are selectable values for the
 Clinical and Pathologic Stage Group for Lymphoma cases.

 Back out/Rollback Plan
 ----------------------
 This patch contains routines which could be re-installed if they were 
 Backed Up in item #2c above.  However, the patch also contains several 
 data conversions that go along with some ^DD changes and changes to the 
 Oncology Data Extract Format (#160.16) file, as well as a modified Input 
 Template and some Print Templates.  These changes are required for VistA 
 Oncology cases to be compliant with NAACCR v16 and therefore it is not 
 recommended to try to roll back the patch.  If any assistance is needed 
 please contact the development team and/or customer support for help.
