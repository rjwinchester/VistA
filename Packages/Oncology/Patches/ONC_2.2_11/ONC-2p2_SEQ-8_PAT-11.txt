     on the KIDS Installation menu. 
  
  2. Prior to installing the patch you may want to make use of the 
     following optional installation options located on the
     KIDS Installation menu:
   
     a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will 
        allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
        transport global. 
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this 
        patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
        (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).

 Back out/Rollback Plan
 ----------------------
  Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
  participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
  to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
  personnel and other appropriate VA personnel. 
   
  Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
  saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
  Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option. The message containing the 
  backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at 
  the Message Action prompt. The PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE is 
  then used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA system.
  
 Note: In the event that a site decides to back out this 
  patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit 
  an IT Service Desk ticket. The development team will then assist with the
  backout process and restoration of the Print Templates.
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure of the Routines: 
  -----------------------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
  the ONC routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
  Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the ONC routines have been 
  backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain 
  the designation of patch ONC*2.2*11 on line 2 in the patch list section.

====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
