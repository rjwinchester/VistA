Subject: Fix State Reporting and other issues

Category:

Description:
============

 1. Remove Cases where Class of Case=34 from State Extracts
 In the "Create a report to preview State/VACCR output" [ONCO #STATE
 DATA REPORT] and the "Create State/VACCR Data Download" [ONCO
 #STATE DATA DISK] options, if the "Analytic Cases Only? //" prompt is
 answered "NO", primaries with CLASS OF CASE=34 are currently included
 in the State Extracts.  These cases should not be included in the State
 Extracts and have been removed from the data download and the preview
 report in the two options above.
 
 2. Histology Updates for ICD-O-3 MORPHOLOGY file (#169.3) in Preparation
 for NAACCR v2018
 NAACCR has provided a list of new histology codes, behavior codes and
 new terms that will be reportable in 2018.  In preparation for these updates
 the new and updated codes will be included in the ICD-O-3 MORPHOLOGY file
 (#169.3) file and the length of the SYNONYM/EQUIVALENT TERM field (#2)
 sub-field (#169.32, .01) has been expanded to 70 characters.
 The new histology descriptions may be found here:
 https://www.naaccr.org/2018-implementation/
 
 3. Problem with Clinical and Pathologic Stage Group fields automatically
 filling (A) or (B) suffix
 In the Abstract for Lymphoma cases, in the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5),
 STAGE GROUP CLINICAL field (#38) and STAGE GROUP PATHOLOGIC (#88) fields 
 were inadvertently getting an extra suffix.
 This was due to an update in Patch ONC*2.2*6 (item # 8) in which new codes
 were added to the Stage Group values, so that the automatic filling of the
 suffix from the ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5), LYMPH NODES field (#31) was
 redundant.  This redundancy has been removed.
 
 4. Send BLANK for State/Requestor Items (columns 2340-3339 in SEER State Extract
 In the "Create State/VACCR Data Download" [ONCO #STATE DATA DISK] option,
 the SEER State Record Layout (V16.0) was sending the NPI Primary Surgeon,
 Radiation Oncologist and Medical Oncologist NPI numbers in columns 2340-2369
 which was causing a problem.  These columns should be reserved for State
 Specific data fields and therefore these values will be removed, and columns 
 2340-3339 will be blank.
 
 5. New Grade fields and Staging/SSDi word processing fields added to Abstracts
 In preparation for the NAACCR 2018 implementation, 3 new Grade fields and 2
 new word processing fields have been added to the Abstract Edit Primary
 [ONCO ABSTRACT-EDIT] option and displays.  The new Grade fields are GRADE
 CLINICAL (#165.5, #24.3), GRADE PATHOLOGICAL (#165.5, #24.4) and GRADE
 POST-THERAPY (#165.5, #24.5).  These fields do not yet have all of the site
 specific codes for each field but they will allow users to enter the allowable
 values (1,2,3,4,5,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,L,H,M,S).  The TEXT-STAGING (#165.5, #285)
 and TEXT-SITE SPECIFIC DATA ITEMS (#165.5, #286) word processing fields
 have also been added to assist registrars in storing text data relevant to
 staging and the site-specific data items.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 There are no documentation changes with this patch but the existing 
 Oncology documentation is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at one of the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices: 
    Hines
    Salt Lake City
  
 Sites may retrieve Oncology documentation in one of the following ways: 
   (1) The preferred method is to SFTP the files from     
       download.vista.domain.ext, which will transmit the files from 
       the first available FTP server.
   (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
       specific server listed below: 
         Hines          ftp.domain.ext
         Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext
  
 (3) Documentation can also be retrieved from the VistA Documentation  
     Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address, 
     http://www.domain.ext/vdl.

  1. Load the KIDS distribution file via the 'Load a Distribution' option 
     on the KIDS Installation menu. 
  
  2. Prior to installing the patch you may want to make use of the 
     following optional installation options located on the
     KIDS Installation menu:
   
     a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will 
        allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
        transport global. 
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this 
        patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
        (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).  
     c. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a 
        backup message of any routines exported with this patch. It will 
        not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.  
  
  3. Install the KIDS distribution via the 'Install Package(s)'  
       option on the KIDS Installation menu.
  
       a. When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion 
          of Install? NO//' Answer NO.      
       b. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install'
          NO//' Answer NO.   
       c. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
          and Protocols? NO//' Answer NO. 
  
 Back out/Rollback Plan
 ----------------------
  Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
  participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
  to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
  personnel and other appropriate VA personnel. 
   
  Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
  saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
  Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option. The message containing the 
  backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at 
  the Message Action prompt. The PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE is 
  then used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA system.
 
 Note: In the event that a site decides to back out this 
  patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit 
  an IT Service Desk ticket. The development team will then assist with the
  backout process and restoration of the DD and Input Template.
 
 Validation of Backout Procedure of the Routines: 
  -----------------------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
  the ONC routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
  Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the ONC routines have been 
  backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain 
  the designation of patch ONC*2.2*9 on line 2 in the patch list section.
