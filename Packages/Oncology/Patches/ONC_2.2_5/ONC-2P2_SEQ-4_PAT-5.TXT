Description:
============

 This patch contains enhancements that extend and improve the functionality
 of the VistA OncoTrax package.  The purpose of this release is to update
 the functionality as described below.
  
 All Data Dictionary modifications and additions have been reviewed and
 approved by the Data Base Administrator. 
  
 CA SERVICE DESK MANAGER INCIDENTS ADDRESSED:
 I7282506FY16
 BMC REMEDY INCIDENT ADDRESSED:
 INC000001107492 - IPv6 Transition for Oncology 
  
 1. Remove Recurrence Date-1st Flag if Date of First Recurrence is modified
  
 Registrars need the RECURRENCE TYPE-1ST FLAG (#165.5, #999.21) field to be
 deleted if the registrar modifies the DATE OF FIRST RECURRENCE (#165.5, #70)
 field.  The RECURRENCE TYPE-1ST FLAG was added to the EDITS Modifications
 module in a previous patch so that users are allowed to override the calculated
 value.  However this field needs to be reset if the recurrence is edited.
 This was accomplished by adding a trigger cross-reference to the DATE OF
 FIRST RECURRENCE (#165.5,#70) field so that if the field is modified it will
 delete the value in the RECURRENCE TYPE-1ST FLAG (#165.5, #999.21) field.
  
 2. Add time stamp to the Date Case Completed and Date Case Last Changed fields
  
 To assist managers/supervisor in verification of the date and time a case was
 either completed or changed, the DATE CASE COMPLETED (#165.5, #90) and DATE
 CASE LAST CHANGED (#165.5, #198) fields will now store and display the date &
 time.  Previously these fields only stored the date and not a time stamp, so
 this patch will add the time stamp to both fields.  This will be displayed in
 the Abstract Edit Primary [ONCO ABSTRACT-EDIT] option.
  
 3. Change Case Administration and Timeliness Report to Display Elapsed Days
 To Completion
  
 Two options have been updated to display the ELAPSED DAYS TO
 COMPLETION (#165.5, #157) field: the Timeliness Report [ONC TIMELINESS REPORT]
 option and the Abstract Edit Primary [ONCO ABSTRACT-EDIT] option, under the
 Case Administration section. This replaces the display of ELAPSED MONTHS TO
 COMPLETION (#165.5, #157.1) field.  The reason is that the CoC's (Commission
 on Cancer) Completeness Report now uses days to completion rather than months
 to completion. 
  
 4. Add the name of the registrar who created a follow-up in the
 Case Administration display
  
 In the Abstract Edit Primary [ONCO ABSTRACT-EDIT] option, under the Case
 Administration section, the name of the registrar who last edited the Abstract,
 stored in the CASE LAST CHANGED BY (#165.5, #199) field is displayed after the
 DATE CASE LAST CHANGED (#165.5, #198) field.  This field will be triggered to
 record the name of the registrar who did the editing even if it was a
 Follow-Up added.
   
 5. Allow registrar to over-ride '988' value stuffed in discontinued Site
 Specific Factor (SSF) fields
  
 For SSF fields that have been discontinued a value of '988' is stuffed into
 the fields.  It was not possible for registrars to go in
 and enter a value for those fields.  Some sites however, may still choose to
 use those fields even though they have been discontinued by Collaborative 
 Staging.  For this reason, this patch will add checks to the stuffing of
 discontinued fields to check if the SSF has a value first and if so do not
 stuff; this allows the registrar to enter a value which will override the
 stuffed value.
  
 6. Expand the Performance Status at DX codes
  
 Expand the allowable selections for the PERFORMANCE STATUS AT
 DX (#165.5, #227) field to include ECOG and KPS (Karnofsky Performance
 Scale) values.  No conversion of existing data is necessary.  The description
 and help text for this field has also been expanded and modified for the
 new selections.  The newly added codes are:
        0        ECOG 0
        1        ECOG 1
        2        ECOG 2
        3        ECOG 3
        4        ECOG 4
        5        ECOG 5
        9        UNKNOWN
       10        KPS 10
       20        KPS 20
       30        KPS 30
       40        KPS 40
       50        KPS 50
       60        KPS 60
       70        KPS 70
       80        KPS 80
       90        KPS 90
      100        KPS 100
  
 7. Remove Clinical and Pathologic TNM fields from required items
  
 To change an Abstract Status to "Complete" there is a list of required
 data items that must be filled in.  If any of these fields are not entered
 there is a warning displayed and the abstract will not change to complete.
 The CLINICAL T (#165.5, #37.1), CLINICAL N (#165.5, #37.2), PATHOLOGIC
 T (#165.5, #85) and PATHOLOGIC N (#165.5, #86) fields are no longer
 required to complete an abstract and have been removed from the
 required fields check.
  
 8. Update the text for Surgical Procedure code selection #15 of
 LUNG (C34._) cases
  
 For LUNG (C34._) cases, the SURGERY OF PRIMARY (F) (#165.5, #58.6) field
 will be updated to add the text "; RFA" to code selection #15.  The new code
 text will now look like this:
       15    Local tumor destruction, NOS; RFA
  
 9. Add 10 User Defined Fields (UDF) for creation and use at each facility
  
 Add 10 new fields in the abstract, UDF #1 - #10.  The fields are free text,
 1-6 characters long.   These 10 new fields have been added to the Abstract Edit
 Primary [ONCO ABSTRACT-EDIT] option in a new module:  9. User-Defined Fields.
 They will also show up within the Abstract towards the end just before the
 Abstract Status.
  
 10. Add newly required codes to Other Staging System
  
 Expand the allowable selections for the OTHER STAGING SYSTEM (#165.5,
 #39) field.  This field is a pointer to the OTHER STAGING FOR ONCOLOGY (#164.3)
 File.  The new PCLC and UNOS codes have been added to the file for selection
 in the OTHER STAGING SYSTEM field.  The newly added fields are:
    BCLC A0
    BCLC A1
    BCLC A2
    BCLC A3
    BCLC A4
    BCLC B
    BCLC C
    BCLC D
    UNOS T1
    UNOS T2
    UNOS T3
    UNOS T4a
    UNOS T4b
  
 11. Add new Clinical and Pathologic Stage Descriptor fields to the Abstract 
  
 Add CLINICAL STAGE DESCRIPTOR (#165.5, #241) and PATHOLOGIC STAGE
 DESCRIPTOR (#165.5, #242) fields to the abstract (after the STAGE GROUP fields)
 for all primary sites.  The codes and help text for these set of codes fields
 was also expanded.  
  
 12. Screen C18.1 cases from RQRS option regardless of selected sorting fields
  
 Screen the C18.1 (67181) cases from the Create RQRS Extract [CREATE RQRS
 EXTRACT] option when user runs the option sorted by DATE CASE LAST
 CHANGED (#165.5, #198) or ACCESSION NUMBER (#165.5, #.05).  Currently the
 C18.1 cases are only screened when the user runs the option sorted by DATE
 DX (#165.5, #3).
  
 13. Remove of the Print Abstract-Brief (80c) [PRINT ABSTRACT-BRIEF 80] option
  
 The Print Abstract-Brief (80c) [PRINT ABSTRACT-BRIEF 80] option which had been
 marked for deletion previously, will be removed from the Abstracting/Printing
 [ABSTRACT ENTRY/PRINT] menu. 
  
 14. Remove skipping of Performance Status at DX
  
 For abstracts which skip over the Staging/TNM coding (for instance, UNKNOWN
 primaries) the abstract would also skip past the PERFORMANCE STATUS AT
 DX (#165.5, #227) field.  This has been modified so that the PERFORMANCE
 STATUS AT DX field is not skipped and may be edited by the user.
  
 15. Correct auto-staging for angiosarcoma and malignant mesenchymoma cases
  
 For C38._ and C49._  cases with Histology of 8990/3 or 9120/3 the Abstract
 Edit Primary [ONCO ABSTRACT-EDIT] option would stuff the staging fields with
 '88' and skip over this section.  This is no longer correct and will be fixed.
 For these cases the fields will no longer be stuffed and skipped; the
 registrars will now be able to edit these fields.
  
 16. New selection in RQRS Option to select All Analytic Cases
  
 Previously the Create RQRS Extract [ONCO RQRS EXTRACT] option would only
 include Breast, Colon and Rectum cases.  A new selection is needed which will
 allow the user to select ALL cases.  The previous selection will remain so
 users can run the report either by selecting ALL cases or only Breast, Colon
 and Rectum cases.
  
 17. Internet Protocol v6
  
 Routines ONCX10 and ONCXURL will be updated to allow for
 handling of new Internet Protocol v6 format, while retaining the existing
 functionality to handle the old Internet Protocol v4 format.  Since the
 IPv6 is not yet in use, installation and testing of this functionality should
 just confirm that no new problems are introduced and that Collaborative
 Staging and EDITS continue to work correctly. 
  
 18. Correct EDITS error returned for C17.9 cases with Histology of 9930/3
  
 When completing an abstract for cases with PRIMARY SITE (#165.5, #20)
 field = "C17.9" and HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-3) (#165.5, 22.3) field = "99303" an
 EDITS error was being returned.  The EDITS error indicated a "00" for
 SURGERY  OF PRIMARY (F) (#165.5, #58.6) field.  The OncoTrax code was
 sending an incorrect value for field #58.6 to the EDITS URL which was
 resulting in an error being returned by the EDITS.  This code was modified
 to send the correct value for field #58.6 which eliminates the EDITS error.
  
 19. Accession Only Abstract Status trigger Abstracted By field
  
 When setting an ABSTRACT STATUS (#165.5, #91) to "Accession Only"
 a trigger will be added to set the ABSTRACTED BY (#165.5, #92) field to
 record the Registrar's Name.  Previously this field was only triggered
 for Abstracts to "Complete".  This is needed for QA at sites so that
 facilities will be able to track "Accession Only" cases.
  
 20. Update code text value for SEER Summary Stage
  
 For the SEER SUMMARY STAGE 2000 (#165.5, #35) and SEER SUMMARY
 STAGE ABBREVIATED (#165.5, #35.1) fields the text value for selection #8
 needs to be updated to "NA/Benign".
  
 21. Exclude ICD10 PHI Codes from ACOS & State/VACCR Data Download options
  
 The Create ACOS Data Download [ONCO #SITE-CREATE ACOS DISK] and Create
 State/VACCR Data Download [ONCO #STATE DATA DISK]
 options were excluding ICD9 PHI codes from the COMORBIDITY section if the
 user chose to exclude them.  This patch will also allow the user to exclude
 the ICD10 PHI codes from the SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS section if the user chooses
 to exclude them.
  
 22. Value of N88 not allowed for CLIN & PATH T,N,M,GROUP fields for C44 cases
  
 For Cutaneous Leiomyosarcoma cases with Primary Site = C44 and
 Histology = 8890/3 the user was not able to enter the '88' value for Clinical
 and Pathologic Staging fields.  This is fixed so that '88' values are allowed
 and show up in the help text.
  
 23. Histology 9421/1 obsolete for cases with DATE DX of 1/1/2001 or later
  
 For cases with a Date DX of 1/1/2001 or later the Histology of 9421/1 is
 obsolete and will no longer be selectable.  The user will see the following
 message: 94211 is obsolete for primaries starting 2001!!!!
  
 24. Update of the Health Summary ONC Remote Data View
  
 The Collaborative Staging section will be removed from the Health Summary
 ONC Remote Data View.  This was required due to the display of old/outdated
 AJCC 6th Edition fields.  Also, since Collaborative Staging of TNM values
 will be retired with 2016 and later cases, these obsolete fields should be
 removed from the displays anyway.  These changes are included in the
 associated Health Summary patch, GMTS*2.7*117, which must be installed in
 conjunction with patch ONC*2.2*5.
  
 25. CA Service Desk Incident # 7282506FY16: Queuing Issue in Automatic
 Casefinding-PTF Search Option
  
 The Automatic Casefinding-PTF Search [ONCO SUSPENSE-CASEFIND (PTF)] option
 was modified for ICD-10 in Patch ONC*2.2*7, but a problem with queueing the
 report was found.  If the report was queued to print at a later time, the
 report would error out with an Undefined SBCIND variable.  This has been fixed.
  
 26. New HEMA @FAC Fields Created and Added to the Abstract
  
 Two new @FAC fields were created and added to the Abstract: HEMA
 TRANS/ENDOCRINE PROC @FAC (#165.5, #153.2) and HEMA TRANS/ENDOCRINE PR@FAC
 DT (#165.5, #153.3).  These 2 new fields have been added to the Abstract Edit
 Primary [ONCO ABSTRACT-EDIT] option for display and editing.  The 2 fields were
 also added to the Print Abstract-Extended (80c) [ONCO ABSTRACT-EXTENDED 80]
 and Print Complete Abstract (132c) [ONCO ABSTRACT-PRINT/E0132] report options.
  
 27. Change Default of Secondary Diagnosis Prompt to YES
  
 In the Complete Abstract [ONCOXM10] option the default value for the "Would
 you like to edit the SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS #1-10 prompts" has been changed
 from "No" to "Yes".
  
 28. Fix Code for Follow-Up Status (#160, #15.2) Field & Convert Incorrect Values
  
 The FOLLOW-UP STATUS (#160, #15.2) field was not being set correctly by the
 OncoTrax software.  This field is not editable by the Registrars, it is only
 set within the code.  For patients with only 1 Primary and a Class of Case
 for that primary of 00 or 30-99 the Follow-Up Status should always be set to
 0 (Inactive).  The code was allowing these to be set to 1 (Active) or 8 (LTF)
 which was not correct.  The code to set the field was corrected and an item
 was added to the Post-Init routine to correct any bad values in existing
 entries.
  
 29. Correct Staging for Waldenstrom Cases (Primary Site=C42.0, Histology=9761/3)
  
 Waldentrom Cases with SITE/GP=HEMATO/RETICULO, PRIMARY SITE=C42.0 and
 HISTOLOGY=9761/3 were not staging correctly.  These cases were not correctly
 dropping into the 'SYSTEMIC DISEASE - No EOD/TMN Coding' section.  This is now
 corrected so that these cases will drop into the correct staging and have the
 correct default values filled in.      
  
 30. Correct the TNM Staging for Pancreas Cases with Histology = 8240 - 8244
  
 Pancreas Cases with a Histology in the range of 8240-8244 were defaulting the
 TNM Staging values to 88's.  Previously this was correct because these cases
 were excluded from TNM Staging, but beginning in 2010 these Histologies are
 now included as part of the Pancreas schema.  This is corrected so that these
 cases will allow TNM staging values to be entered.
