Description:
============

 Note: Technical support staff at Austin Information Technology Center 
 (AITC) installed this enhancement release on the Direct Secure 
 Messaging servers using a pre-approved Request for Change 
 Order and an Implementation Plan.  This Deployment actually took place on 
 November 29th, 2018 from 10:00 PM EST to 11:45 PM EST. 
  
 No effort was required by local sites. 
  
 User Acceptance Test is by the direction of the Direct Secure Messaging
 Business Owner and no MOUs are required.
 **************************************************************************
  
 Direct Secure Messaging (DSM) Release 1.12.4 contained several high 
 priority business requirements including the integration of the Decision 
 Support Services (DSS) provider search capability and several fixes 
 related to the handling of XDM zip files within the Direct Secure 
 Messaging application. This build also includes a minor fix for a legacy 
 defect that removes two invalid/non-functioning options from the user 
 interface (save to DAS and save to VistA). These changes are Work Items 
 that were recorded and tracked in the Direct Secure Messaging area of 
 Rational Team Concert, the VA-prescribed tool used for tracking 
 requirements and associated test plans. This release contains the Work 
 Items completed during a production deployment. Release 1.12.4 consists 
 of the following enhancements to the Direct Secure Messaging system:
  
 -       DSS Integration - Provider Contact Information
 -       DSS Integration - DSS Provider Directory Navigation
 -       DSS Integration - DSS Provider Directory Information Content
 -       DSS Integration - Message Compose Functionality
 -       XDM Zip File Fix
 -       Save to DAS and VistA Imaging Options Removal
  
 Supporting technical documentation including the DSM System Design 
 Document, User Guide, Production Operation Manual (POM), and 
 Install/Rollback Guide were updated to reflect the integration of the DSS 
 provider search capability and the fixes related to the XDM zip file 
 issues.
