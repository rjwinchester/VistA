 **************************************************************************
 Direct Secure Messaging (DSM) Release 1.11.0.1 contains code changes 
 (enhancements) as well as architecture changes to the Direct Secure 
 Messaging system.  These changes are Work Items that were recorded and 
 tracked in the Direct area of Rational Team Concert, the VA-prescribed 
 tool used for tracking requirements and associated test plans.  This 
 release contains the Work Items completed during production deployment.
 This enhancement release consists of the following enhancements to the 
 Direct Secure Messaging system:
 Direct Secure Messaging 1.11.0.2 (Build 4) release integrates Direct with 
 the VA Single Sign-On internal (SSOi) system. The VA SSOi integration 
 with Direct will provide the ability for internal users to access a 
 variety of VA systems and applications using a reduced set of login 
 credentials, including VA-issued PIV cards or credentials generated by 
 the VA Active Directory. The integration provides additional features 
 that include the ability to authenticate an active VA Internal user, 
 management of the user session that takes into account active sessions in 
 other SSOi enabled applications, and also provides the ability for users 
 to log out from all active SSOi-integrated applications. 
 Other advancements were to the DSM Webmail Application compose screen to 
 adhere to the new Patient Authorization requirements to ensure VA 
 compliance when DSM user sends a Direct message. Additional changes were 
 made to database structure to account for the new patient authorizations 
 and user interface changes were provided to the DSM users that explain 
 the new patient authorizations. Improvements to Direct also include the 
 ability for a user with an apostrophe in their name to able to 
 successfully register for a DSM Account and receive external 
 notifications from the DSM System.
 Finally, the entire DSM SDD was correct represent the new system design, 
 interfaces, and data flows to account for the SSOi Integration.
