 Ticket Overview:
 ================
  1. INC000000840342 - Bene Travel - General: Report Showing $0.00
    
      Problem:
      --------
      The 'Standard Claims Output' report in the Report of Claim Amounts 
      [DGBT BENE TRAVEL REPORT] option is not adding the TOTAL INVOICE AMOUNT
      (#60) field from Special Mode claims to the $TOTAL column of the report.
    
      Resolution:
      -----------
      Routine DGBTOA2 has been modified to use the TOTAL INVOICE AMOUNT (#60) 
      value instead of AMOUNT PAYABLE (#10) field for when the claim type is 
      Special Mode.
   
   
  2. INC000000848999 - Bene Travel - 9 digit zip codes printing with two 
                       dashes "- -".
    
      Problem:
      --------
      If the ZIP (#1.04) field of the INSTITUTION (#4) file contains a nine 
      digit zip code, a hyphen is being improperly saved in the ZIP 
      CODE/DESTINATION (#28.2) field of the BENEFICIARY TRAVEL CLAIM (#392) 
      file.
    
      Resolution:
      -----------
      Routine DGBTE1 has been modified to remove the hyphen from the nine 
      digit zip code before it is saved in the ZIP CODE/DESTINATION (#28.2) 
      field. Routines DGBTCD and DGBTCR have been modified to display the 
      FileMan external format for the zip code. Also, created post-init 
      routine DGBT1P28 to correct any existing zip code entries in the 
      BENEFICIARY TRAVEL CLAIM (#392) file that contain a hyphen.
                
               
  3. INC000000966732 - Bene Travel - General: Denial Letter Print
    
      Problem:
      --------
      The Reprint Denial of Benefits Letters [DGBT REPRINT DENIAL LETTERS] 
      option is incorrectly displaying the name of the current user, rather 
      than the name of the user that entered the claim.
   
      Resolution:
      -----------
      Routine DGBTDLT1 has been modified to display the name of the user that 
      entered the claim rather than the current user.
         
         
  4. INC000001035335 - Bene Travel - General: Denial Letter duplicate wording
    
      Problem:
      --------
      The phrase "date you completed travel associated with your" is repeated
      in the BT Denial of Benefits Letter when "30 Day Application 
      Requirement" is selected as the reason for denial.
         
      Resolution:
      -----------     
      The TEXT (#1) field of the "30 DAY APPLICATION REQUIREMENT" entry in the
      BENEFICIARY TRAVEL DENIAL REASONS (#392.8) file is modified with
      routine DGBT1P28 to remove the duplicate wording. The corrected
      version will replace the existing text in the field, even if it has 
      already been corrected at the site.
  
  5. INC000001118197 - Bene Travel - General: SP Mode - Round Trip/One Way not
                       displaying correctly
  
      Problem:
      --------
      When using the View of Claim [DGBT BENE TRAVEL VIEW] option to view a 
      special mode claim, the "One Way/Round Trip:" prompt will always display
      'One Way'.
  
      Resolution:
      -----------   
      Routine DGBTCDSP has been modified to correctly display the appropriate 
      trip type.
  
  
  6. I5637262FY15 - Bene Travel terminated sessions 
  
      Problem:
      --------
      Sites are getting an undefined error when the MULTIDIVISION MED CENTER?
      (#11) field in the MAS PARAMETER (#43) file is set to zero.
  
      Resolution:
      -----------   
      Modified code in routine DGBTE to prevent the undefined error when the 
      MULTIDIVISION MED CENTER? (#11) field is set to zero.
  
  
  7. I7382571FY16 - Bene Travel Claims are being deleted
    
      Problem:
      --------
      If a clerk goes into an existing claim and then enters a "^" at the 
      "Is this a Mileage or Special Mode Claim?: M//" prompt, all fields in the 
      claim will be deleted.
   
      Resolution:
      -----------
      Routine DGBTE has been modified by adding a check to see if the clerk
      is editing an existing claim, if so the fields in the claim will be
      preserved.
