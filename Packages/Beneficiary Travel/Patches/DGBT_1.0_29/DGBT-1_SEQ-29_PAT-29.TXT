  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch is to notify the VAMC facilities of a Beneficiary Travel (BT)
 Bulletin being released with the Enrollment System (ES) 4.1 VistA support
 patches for the Enrollment Customer Enhancements (ECE) and Enrollment System
 Enhancements (ESE) projects. The DG_53_P891.KID host file includes patch
 EAS*1*113 which adds the following enhancements.
  
 An enhancement to the ES HL7 ORU-Z06 message sends the BT Financial
 Indicator (BTFI) to VistA in the ZMT-31 segment-sequence. The BTFI will
 be stored to the BT FINANCIAL INDICATOR (#4) field of the ANNUAL MEANS
 TEST (#408.31) file.
                                                 
 A BT CLAIMS PROCESSING Mail group will be automatically created in VistA
 to receive a new BT Bulletin named EAS BT CLAIMS PROCESSING.  Users who
 validate BT eligibility based on income or process BT claims should be
 added to the mail group.
  
 When an IVM converted/reversal income test is received from ES, a check will
 be done to see if the BT Financial Indicator is different than the BT
 Financial Indicator on file (e.g. the new Financial Indicator is 1 (YES)
 and the BT Financial Indicator on File is 0 (No),or the new status is 0 (NO)
 and the BT Financial Indicator on File is 1 (Yes) or a null).  If the BT
 Financial Indicator has changed, a bulletin will be sent to the BT CLAIMS
 PROCESSING Mail group.
  
    The bulletin will contain the following information:

  first available FTP server.  Sites may also elect to retrieve software
  directly from a specific server as follows:
   
         OI&T FIELD OFFICE       FTP ADDRESS                DIRECTORY
