 Problem: 
 -------
 The Department of Veterans Affairs Cybersecurity Task Force has been tasked 
 by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Inspector General (IG) to 
 address identified material weaknesses. This task force has mandated that 
 all internal, user facing VA applications become two factor authentication
 (2FA) compliant by April 30, 2017. 
  
 In order to be compliant, applications are required to authenticate users 
 via Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards.  
  
 Note: Access and Verify codes will no longer be permitted for employees and 
 contractors to access VA applications.  
   
 Resolution:
 ----------
 As part of the transition to 2FA, BT Dashboard was updated to
 utilize the CA SiteMinder WebAgent and the SSOi Secure Token
 Service (STS) to authenticate users with their PIV card.
