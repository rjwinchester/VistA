 Ticket Overview:
 ================
  1. I7165678FY16 - Bene Travel: Fayetteville is unable to change mileage fee 
                    for air ambulance vendor
    
      Problem:
      --------
      The Beneficiary Travel Claim (#392) file, Special Mode, Mileage
      Fee (#62) field and prompt are both capped at $10,000. This
      value needs to be increased.
    
      Resolution:
      -----------
      Routine DGBTSP1 has been edited to increase the maximum value of the
      Mileage Fee to $500,000 and the Total Invoice Amount to $999,999. 
      The Mileage Fee (#62) and Total Invoice Amount (#60) fields of the
      Beneficiary Travel Claim (#392) file have also been updated to
      reflect the new maximum values. Additionally, the NO SHOW/NO LOAD FEE
      (#63) field and all of the Special Mode help prompts have been updated to 
      reflect the correct minimum value of zero.
  
  2. R11628779FY17 - Ann Arbor /BT Denial Letter Corrections  
  
      Problem:
      --------
      The Beneficiary Travel Denial Letter is hard coded to default to an
      old Minneapolis office mail code.
  
      Resolution:
      -----------
      Routines DGBTDLT and DGBTDLT1 have been modified to update the 
      incorrect default mail code to "BT".
  
  3. I12535496FY17 - Buffalo / Bene Travel / travel app freezing, slow
  
      Problem:
      --------
      When there are multiple claims created for the same date/time, the
      Beneficiary Travel application will appear to freeze, while it 
      searches for the next available, unique date/time.
  
      Resolution:
      -----------     
      Routine DGBTE1 has been modified to improve the efficiency of the
      search when looping for the next available date/time.
