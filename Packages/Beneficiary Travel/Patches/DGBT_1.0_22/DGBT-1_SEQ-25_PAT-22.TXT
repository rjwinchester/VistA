       modify the Division of existing claims.
  
    2. Special Mode claims are being rejected, with a generic  "DATA DID NOT
       FILE DUE TO ERRORS" message.
          
    3. Users are reporting getting an <UNDEFINED>COMPLT+3^DGBTE *% error when
       entering claims.
    
    4. A subscript error occurs when using the View of Claim 
       [DGBT BENE TRAVEL VIEW] option.
  
    5. Users are being returned to the Beneficiary Travel Menu [DGBT BENE 
       TRAVEL MENU] after completing a claim.

    REMEDY OVERVIEW:
    ----------------
   
    1. INC000000844015 - Bene Travel - General: [division issue]
   
     Problem:
     --------
     Before the introduction of patch DGBT*1.0*20, it was not possible to
     modify the DIVISION (#11) field of an existing Beneficiary Travel 
     claim (#392) file. When using the Claim Enter/Edit [DGBT BENE TRAVEL
     SCREEN] option, users are inadvertently modifying the division when
     editing existing claims.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified routines DGBTE1 and DGBTE to retain the division of existing 
     claims during the claim enter/edit process.
  
    2. INC000000850540 - Bene Travel - claim not saved
    
     Problem:
     --------
     When entering a special mode claim, if the selected Vendor has duplicate 
     Vendor name's in the VENDOR (#440) file, the claim will not get filed
     and the generic error message, "DATA DID NOT FILE DUE TO ERRORS", will
     display. This is due to the FILE^DIE call using the external format of 
     the vendor name.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified routine DGBTSP, DGBTSP1 and DGBTCDSP to use the internal IEN of 
     the Vendor. Also modified routine DGBTSP1 to display a more 
     detailed error message that may occur during any FILE^DIE call.
     Example of error message: 
     The value of field SP MODE DEPARTURE ADDRESS1 in file
     BENEFICIARY TRAVEL CLAIM cannot be deleted.
        
    3. INC000000864939 - Bene Travel - General:ERROR $ZE=
                         <UNDEFINED>COMPLT+3^DGBTE *%
    
     Problem:
     --------
     When a user enters an "^" at the prompt, "Complete claim for 
     JUL 15,2013@11:00 ? Yes//", when entering a special mode claim, an 
     undefined error will occur when the user exits the Beneficiary Travel
     application.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified routine DGBTE to properly handle an "^" at the complete claim 
     prompt for special mode claims.
        
        
    4. INC000000872050 - Bene Travel - General: View of Claim error (Missing
                         Division field)
    
     Problem:
     --------
     When opening an existing claim with the View of Claim [DGBT BENE TRAVEL
     VIEW] option, a subscript error, <SUBSCRIPT>SCREEN+6^DGBTCD ^DG(40.8,""), 
     can occur.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Added data validation to routine DGBTCD to prevent the subscript error
     from occurring. If for some reason the DIVISION (#11) field of the
     BENEFICIARY TRAVEL CLAIM (#392) file record is blank, then it will  
     display a message to the user that they need to correct the entry
     via the Claim/Enter Edit [DGBT BENE TRAVEL SCREEN] option.
     Example of message: 
  >> WARNING! No DIVISION specified for this claim, please correct
          through Claim Enter/Edit
  
  
  
    5. INC000000892783 - Bene Travel - return to pt prompt
    
     Problem:
     --------
     CBO has asked that previous functionality be restored, by returning users
     to the "Select PATIENT" prompt after completing a claim.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified routines DGBTE and DGBTCDSP to redisplay the "Select PATIENT"
     prompt after entering a claim.
