 Ticket Overview:      
 ================
  1. INC000000945629 - Bene Travel - General: Pension/Waiver issue
    
      Problem:
      --------
      The Bene Travel software is incorrectly granting a deductible waiver for
      Veterans that are 100% Service Connected (SC) and have a secondary 
      eligibility of 'Aid & Attendance' (A&A) or 'House Bound' (HB).
   
      Resolution:
      -----------
      Routines DGBT1 and DGBTRDVW have been modified to prevent the 
      application from automatically granting waivers if Veterans are 100% SC
      and have a secondary eligibility of A&A or HB. Routine DGBT1 has also 
      been corrected for the 'WAIVER GRANTED:' display to appropriately
      display 'YES' if the veteran has six total trips.
         
  
  2. I6239128FY16 - Dayton BT user says Beneficiary Travel is losing data
    
      Problem:
      --------
      Once the $18 deductible cap for the month has been met for a particular
      veteran, if a clerk uses the Claim Enter/Edit [DGBT BENE TRAVEL SCREEN] 
      option to edit an existing claim, the deductible will be automatically 
      set to zero.
   
      Resolution:
      -----------
      Modified routine DGBTEE and DGBTRDVW to account for the deductible value 
      of the currently selected claim when calculating the total deductible 
      for the month. Routine DGBTCE has also been modified to preserve the
      deductible values of existing claims.
