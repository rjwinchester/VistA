 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  1. INC000000848554 - Deductible exceeds $18
    
      Problem:
      --------
      If more than one claim is entered on a particular day, the software will 
      only apply the first claim's deductible for that day towards the
      total monthly value.
    
      Resolution:
      -----------
      Corrected routine DGBTRDVW to use the time as well as the date of  
      the BENEFICIARY TRAVEL CLAIM (#392) file, Claim DATE/TIME (#.01)
      field when calculating the total deductible for the month. Also
      modified routine DGBTEE to use the total deductible for the month,
      rather than the deductible amount as of the claim date.
  
  2. INC000000891084 - Missing Data (WHO ENTERED INTO FILE and DATE ENTERED
                       INTO THE FILE)
    
      Problem:
      --------
      If a user begins to enter a new claim, but is unable to complete it, a
      partial claim is created. If the user goes back in to complete the 
      partial claim later, the WHO ENTERED INTO FILE (#12) and DATE ENTERED
      INTO THE FILE (#13) fields will not be populated, since that data is not
      filed for existing claims.
    
      Resolution:
      -----------
      Modified routine DGBTE to allow the software to file the WHO ENTERED 
      INTO FILE (#12) and DATE ENTERED INTO THE FILE (#13) fields of 
      the BENEFICIARY TRAVEL CLAIM (#392) file for existing claims if they
      are null. Also made minor spelling corrections in routine DGBTE.
         
        
  3. INC000000927742 - Evaluate for patch to Help Text.
    
      Problem:
      --------
      The "Total Miles" prompt, when entering a special mode claim, 
      currently displays "Type a Number between 0 and 10000, 0 Decimal 
      Digits" for the help text. However, you cannot enter '0'.
   
      Resolution:
      -----------
      Modified the help text in routine DGBTSP to display a '1' instead of
      a '0' and  modified code to limit the maximum value to 10,000 for
      the total mileage amount. Also corrected the field definition in the data
      dictionary for the SPECIAL MODE TOTAL MILES (#68) field of the 
      BENEFICIARY TRAVEL CLAIM (#392) file. (See the Data Dictionary
      section below.) 
         
  4. INC000000965479 - BT claims are changing from complete to incomplete
    
      Problem:
      --------
      If a user enters a Special Mode claim, and then attempts to convert it 
      to a Mileage claim, they will be unable to complete the claim and an 
      incomplete record will be created. Checks in routine DGBTE1 are 
      preventing the departure and destination information from getting filed 
      if editing an existing claim.
   
      Resolution:
      -----------
      Modified routine DGBTE1 to allow the software to file the departure and
      destination information for existing claims.
         
         
  5. INC000001008407 - File 392.3 is not set up correctly
    
      Problem:
      --------
      The system is not properly selecting active Special Mode accounts if 
      there is more than one Special Mode account on the system.
    
      Resolution:
      -----------     
      Modified routine DGBTSP to correctly loop through the BENEFICIARY TRAVEL
      ACCOUNT (#392.3) file. Also modified the code to evaluate appropriately 
      if the leading characters in an account name are '000'.
  
  
  6. INC000001020140 - Division not being retained in denial letter
  
      Problem:
      --------
      When creating a claim and then subsequently creating a denied claim,
      the Division is not properly stored.
  
      Resolution:
      -----------   
      Modified routine DGBTCD to prevent it from killing the division variable
      after displaying a claim.

 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 ========================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
    
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the file from 
      download.vista.domain.ext, which will transmit the file from 
      the first available FTP server.
     
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
      specific server as follows:
     
      Albany                ftp.domain.ext
      Hines                 ftp.domain.ext
      Salt Lake City        ftp.domain.ext
     
      The documentation distribution includes:
