  1. I18404343FY18 - Iowa City/Omaha - BT - Denial letter printing Div
                     selected rather than claim Div address 
    
      Problem:
      --------
      When a user prints the 70-3542d form after entering a claim and then
      subsequently edits an existing denied claim, the Division (#11) field
      is being overridden by the site's default Division.
    
      Resolution:
      -----------
      Routine DGBTCR has been modified to preserve the existing Division 
      variable to save its previous value.
  
  2. I18812921FY18 - Columbia SC - BT - Claim entry slowdown 
  
      Problem:
      --------
      When multiple users attempt to enter claims with the same date and time, 
      they may experience freezing while the system searches for the next 
      available record number (date/time). If a user then closes their session
      before the lookup can finish, this can leave behind a lock on a record 
      number that does not exist. Also, if a user starts a claim but chooses
      "No" at the "Are you sure you want to add a new claim" prompt, that 
      record number is not unlocked until they exit the Claim Enter/Edit [DGBT 
      BENETRAVEL SCREEN] option. If a user quits their session before exiting
      the option, multiple locks could be left behind.
  
      Resolution:
      -----------
      The record number lookup in routine DGBTE1 has been modified to skip a 
      record number that is locked, but does not exist. Additionally, an 
      incremental unlock has been added to immediately unlock the record 
      number regardless of whether the user chooses to create the claim or 
      not.
