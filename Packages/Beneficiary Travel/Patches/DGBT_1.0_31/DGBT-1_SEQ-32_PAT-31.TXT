 Ticket Overview:      
 ================
 1. I6492432FY16 - BTD error retrieving appt data / Houston / Brandon Carter
   
    Problem:
    --------
    If a Veteran has any combination of appointments, notes, orders or 
    consults that, when combined, exceed the Cache maximum value of 32,767 
    characters, users will receive a 'MAXSTRING' error.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The GetAppointments, GetNotes, GetOrders and GetConsults methods in the
    Patient class have been modified to limit the total number of displayed
    entries to prevent the MAXSTRING error.
  
  
 2. I8797938FY16 - Business Office / BT Dashboard / rearrange screen to fit
                   appointments better 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    If a Veteran has many appointments, notes, orders or consults the clerks
    need to scroll down to view the 'Claim One Way' section. The Business
    Office would like for this information to be more visible.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The 'DashboardCb' class has been modified to move the 'Claim One Way'
    section from the sixth item on the list to third.
