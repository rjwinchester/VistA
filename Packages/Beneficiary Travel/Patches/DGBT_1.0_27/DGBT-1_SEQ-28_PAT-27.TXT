 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
   
 1. INC000000774328 - [pending patch] Web site for Beneficiary Travel 
                      Dashboard 1.0 does not ask user for access/verify.
   
    Problem:
    --------
    The Dashboard inactivity timeout is too long.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified dgbtLogin.csp to decrease the inactivity timeout, the amount of 
    time until a clerk is automatically logged off, from 6000 seconds to 
    1200 seconds.
  
  
 2. INC000000775924 - error displaying site intro text from non-sequential 
                       numeric nodes
   
    Problem:
    --------
    An error occurs in BT Dashboard when the sites intro text is stored in an
    array with non-sequential subscripts. This is due to a FOR loop, written 
    with a linear increment, attempting to display subscripts of the intro 
    array that do not exist.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified dgbtLogin.csp to use a parameterless FOR loop, which will only 
    display subscripts of the array that exist.
  
  
 3. INC000000789376 - Error when accessing BT dashboard.
   
    Problem:
    --------
    Users are reporting HyperEvent errors randomly when using BT Dashboard.
    These issues are related to connectivity issues, network latency, and 
    failure of the BING API to complete multiple requests.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Added a number of checks to the BING API call in dgbtDashboard.csp to 
    retry if an error is encountered during the first attempt.
  
  
 4. INC000000833381 - Bene Travel - Dashboard Other: ACT REQ/CHECKED OUT*
   
    Problem:
    --------
    The $$STATUS^SDAM1 API is being called with incorrect parameters which
    results in an incorrect appointment status being displayed in BT 
    Dashboard.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified the 4th parameter in the $$STATUS^SDAM1 API in the dgbt.Patient
    class to correctly reference the 0th node of the patient appointment
    entry in the PATIENT (#2) file.
        
  
 5. INC000000891700 - BT Dashboard - apostrophe in name causes error
   
    Problem:
    --------
    If a clerk with an apostrophe in their name logs into BT Dashboard,
    anyone attempting to login afterwards will receive a JavaScript error,
    preventing use of the application. The error will persist for all clerks 
    until the claimer list is automatically purged at the end of the day.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified the dgbt.DashboardCb class to use double quotes, to avoid 
    various syntax errors when a name contains an apostrophe.
