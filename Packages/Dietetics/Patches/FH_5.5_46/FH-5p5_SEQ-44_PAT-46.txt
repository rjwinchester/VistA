Subject: ADD NEW FOOD ALLERGIES TO FHSELA2

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the addition of new food allergies by adding them
 into the mapping capability for food preference dislikes.
  
  
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 ----------------------------
 HITPS-1123 (formerly PSPO 1380)
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 -------------------------------------------
 1. INC2381967 - New Food Allergies
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) Allergy team has recently added DAIRY
 FOODS, FRESH FRUITS, FRUITS, MINT HERB, PEPPERMINT HERB, PEPPERMINT OIL,
 and RABBIT MEAT as food allergies to the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82).
 These new food allergies must be added to the routine FHSELA2 in order to
 be mapped as allergy type food preference dislikes in the Dietetics
 package.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine FHSELA2 has a hard-coded list of food allergies. It presents this 
 hard-coded list to the user when adding a food allergy preference dislike
 to the FOOD PREFERENCES file (#115.2) and then maps it to a matching
 record in the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82). The new allergies have been
 added to the hard-coded list of food allergies in routine FHSELA2 so that
 they may be presented to the user.
  
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital (Madison)
 Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System (CAVHCS)
  
  
 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 -----------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize

 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
    Installation Menu.
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select Backup a Transport Global and when

    will create a backup message of any routines exported with this patch.
    It will not backup any other changes such as DDs or templates. If for
    any reason the patch is to be rolled back, this backup will be required
    to restore the patch's routine(s) to the pre-installation version(s).
  
 5. From the Installation Menu, you may elect to use the following options.
    When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch: FH*5.5*46 
  
     a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
     
     b. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to print only 
        a summary of the patch, to print a summary of the patch and the
        routines in the transport global, or to print only the routines in
        the transport global.
  
     c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed. (It compares all components of this patch's routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
 6. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    choose the patch to install.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
    respond NO.
  
 8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
