 ASSOCIATED CA SDM TICKETS:
 =========================
 1. R8802610FY16 - Add new Food, Drug/Food allergies to routine FHSELA2.
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) Allergy team has recently added 
 BAY LEAVES as a food allergy and CARAWAY SEEDS, FRUCTOSE as drug/food
 allergies to the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82). These new food, drug/food
 allergies must be added to the routine FHSELA2 in order to be mapped 
 as allergy type food preference dislikes in the Dietetics package.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine FHSELA2 has a hard coded list of food allergies. It uses
 this hard coded list to present to the user for adding a food 
 allergy preference dislike to the FOOD PREFERENCES file (#115.2) 
 and then map it to a matching record in the GMR ALLERGIES file 
 (#120.82). BAY LEAVES, CARAWAY SEEDS, and FRUCTOSE will be added 
 to the hard coded list of food allergies in routine FHSELA2 so
 they may be presented to the user.
  
 2. I9885798FY16 - The Supplemental Feeding associated with a diet is not 
    being discontinued when a new diet order becomes active at a scheduled
    date/time.
  
 Problem:
 -------
 A patient's current diet order has an associated supplemental feeding. 
 A new diet order is placed and scheduled to start at a later time. When
 the new diet order takes effect, the old diet is cancelled, but the 
 associated supplemental feeding is not getting cancelled.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The code used to cancel the supplemental feeding requires a variable for
 the patient's location (WARD) to be set. If is not set the supplemental 
 feeding cancellation process is stopped. When a diet order is scheduled
 to start at a later date/time it is filed, a TASKMAN task is filed to 
 update the patient's current nutrition admission to link the new diet
 and cancel the old diet's standing orders, supplemental feedings. One
 thing it does not do is set the variable WARD. The update process will
 edited to define the variable WARD.

 Description of Changes:
  Inserted the following line of code at U1+2^FHORD7:
   
    S WARD=$G(^DPT(DFN,.1))
   
  This will set the variable WARD to the value of the data stored in this
  field. It is the WARD LOCATION (field #.1) in the PATIENT file (file #2)
  to which the patient is admitted. With the variable WARD defined, the 
  cancellation logic in CAN^FHNO5 will not exit out unexpectedly.
