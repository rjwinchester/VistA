Subject: ADD NEW FOOD ALLERGY TO FHSELA2

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 the Dietetics package. The patch will also modify allergy type food
 preference IODINE data line in routine FHSELA2 to include General Medical
 Record (GMR) ALLERGY IODINE for mapping.

 CA SDM TICKETS OVERVIEW:
 ========================
 1. I6210894FY16 - Food Allergy Sorbitol needs to be added to the
                   Dietetics package. 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) Allergy team has accepted a request
 to add SORBITOL as a food allergy to the GMR ALLERGY file (#120.82). It
 will soon be available nationwide. It must be added to the routine FHSELA2
 in order to be mapped as an allergy type food preference dislike in the
 Dietetics package.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routing FHSELA2 has a hard coded list of food allergies. It uses
 this hard coded list to present to the user for adding a food 
 allergy preference dislike to the FOOD PREFERENCES file (#115.2) 
 and then map it to a matching record in the GMR ALLERGY file 
 (#120.89). Sorbitol will added to the hard coded list of food 
 allergies in routine FHSELA2 so it may be presented to the user.
  
 Routine: FHSELA2
  
 2. I6283388FY16 - IODINE - Food Allergy
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A request has been submitted to the NTRT Allergy team to update the drug
 allergy Iodine to a drug/food allergy. This is to address the issue with a
 patient who is allergic to Iodine from food sources. In the Nutrition and
 Food Service package, the FOOD PREFERENCES (#115.2) already has an IODINE
 record and it maps to the GMR ALLERGIES (#120.82) file's record IODIZED
 SALT. It needs to map to the GMR ALLERGIES (#120.82) file's record IODINE
 as well.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The IODINE food preference data code line in routine FHSELA2 will be
 modified to include IODINE as a food, drug/food allergy it can map to.
  
 Routine: FHSELA2
  
 Technical Note:
 --------------
 The (EP) - Enter/Edit Food Preferences [FHSEL1] option will not allow the
 user to manually map the allergy type food preference ALLERGY - IODINE
 to GMR Allergy record IODINE until its allergy date is updated from
 drug to drug/food. The (CP) - Create/Map Food Preferences to Allergies
 [FHSELA] option will map the allergy type food preference ALLERGY -
 IODINE to the GMR Allergy record IODINE.
