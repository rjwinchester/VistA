Subject: EPIP FH REMEDIATION 1.0

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 FH*5.5*43 provides the following enhancements to VistA:
  
 - Modifies the VistA Dietetics Report Queuing software to automatically 
 queue Nutrition and Food Service (NFS) reports and labels to run daily, 
 or as often as necessary, without requiring Dietetics staff to manually 
 queue them each day. With many standard reports and labels currently 
 available to NFS staff, it is inefficient and time consuming for users to 
 manually set up and run reports daily.
  
 This enhancement enables an NFS Manager, Clinical Application Coordinator 
 (CAC), or Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator (ADPAC) to 
 set pre-defined options for printing NFS reports and labels 
 automatically, including the routine name and the setup of variables 
 required for the reports to run unattended.
  
 Three new options enabling this functionality are added to the existing 
 Tray Tickets [FHMTKM] menu. The Manager/CAC/ADPAC must be assigned the 
 NFS security key FHMGR to access these options:
  
   - Queued Options Edit [FHQUE OPTION EDIT] displays a list of available 
 reports that can be selected and configured. When configuring a report, 
 the user is prompted for the desired printer and whether it is active, the
 days of the week to run the report, and the time at which to run the
 report (e.g., T-1@18:00, if applicable. A new report option, Print Tray
 Tickets [FHMTKP], prompts the user for the meal ticket to print
 (Breakfast, Noon, or Evening).
  
   - Queue Diet Reports [FHQUE QUEUE DIET REPORTS] passes the configured 
 reports and labels to TaskMan to be executed and printed at the scheduled 
 time. Typically, Queue Diet Reports is scheduled to run once per day, 
 soon after midnight. This option is used for testing to ensure all 
 configured reports print as expected.
  
   - Test an Individual Queued Option [FHQUE TEST] is used to immediately 
 run a single configured report to validate selected options. 
  
 Three new files store the values required for printing NFS reports and 
 labels automatically. The FHQUE AVAILABLE OPTIONS file (#117.0243) stores 
 values such as the time the report is scheduled to run and the printer to 
 which it will be sent. The FHQUE QUEUED REPORTS/LABELS file (#117.024) 
 stores a meaningful description for each of the available reports that 
 display when Queued Options Edit is selected. The FHQUE REPORT DAYS file 
 (#117.0241) stores the days of the week to enable a user to select the 
 day to run the report.
  
 - Enhances the existing Patient Supplemental Feeding List to display the
 most recent patient Diet Order. Diet orders can change frequently based on
 a patient's medical needs; sometimes diet orders are changed in VistA
 after a supplemental feeding is prepared by a food service worker.
 Currently, there is no easy way to check supplemental feeding orders
 against the patient's most recent diet order before delivering the
 supplemental nutrition.
  
 The enhanced Patient Supplemental Feeding List is accessible from 
 the "Run SF Labels/Consolid Ingred List" [FHNO2] option, which is 
 available from the SUPPLEMENTAL FEEDINGS [FHNOM] menu. This 
 enhancement reduces the risk of improper feeding by retrieving 
 current diet order information from VistA and using that data to 
 prepare the Patient Supplemental Feeding List, so that both the 
 current diet order and the supplemental feeding order are included.
  
 - Adds three new fields to the NUTRITION PERSON file (#115) that the 
 staff in a Community Living Center (CLC) can use to enter meal 
 instructions for morning, midday, and evening meals. The new free-text 
 fields include the BREAKFAST FLAG field (#22), the NOON FLAG field 
 (#22.1), and the EVENING FLAG field (#22.2).
  
 The existing Tray Tickets [FHMTKM] menu is further modified to include 
 the new option Tray Ticket Flag Edit [FHMTK1D TRAY TICKET EDIT], which 
 enables CLC staff to enter flag text in the new fields. To use this 
 option, the Ward to which a patient is assigned must include "CLC" in the 
 Ward name. The user is prompted to select either a Ward or a Patient. The 
 BREAKFAST FLAG, NOON FLAG, and EVENING FLAG fields display so that text 
 can be entered in one or more of the fields. The existing Print Tray 
 Tickets [FHMTK1P TRAY TICKET PRINT] option is modified to print flag text 
 on the bottom of the tray ticket where it can be easily seen by clinical 
 staff at mealtime.
  
 This enhancement provides a simple and consistent way to ensure that each 
 patient's mealtime instructions and needs are communicated between team 
 members to ensure patient safety and quality of care.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 Review the Pre-Installation Instructions provided before beginning 
 installation of the patch.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 The pre-installation routine FH43P runs automatically at the start of 
 installation. This routine is required by sites that previously installed
 the FH*5.5*43 patch prior to v14. The FH43P routine removes existing
 data from the files FHQUE AVAILABLE OPTIONS (#117.0243), FHQUE QUEUED
 REPORTS/LABELS (#117.024), and FHQUE REPORT DAYS (#117.0241) and loads new
 data into those files.
  
 The pre-installation routine is automatically deleted after execution.
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system, although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes 
 to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 To install the patch:
  
 1.      Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.      Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
 3.      From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) menu, 
 select the Installation Menu. From this menu, you may elect to use the 
 following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter the patch 
 number FH*5.5*43.
  
 a.      Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will help 
 ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 b.      Print Transport Global - This option will enable viewing the 
 components of the KIDS build.
  
 c.      Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
 enable viewing all changes that will be made when this patch is 
 installed. It compares all components of this patch (routines, data 
 dictionaries, templates, etc.).
  
 d.      Back up a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
 message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not back up any 
 other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
  
 4.      From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option 
 and choose the patch to install.
  
 5.      If prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
 Install? NO//', press <Enter>.
  
 6.      When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
 NO//', press <Enter>.
  
 7.      When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
 and Protocols? NO//', press <Enter>.
  
 8.      If prompted 'Delay install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//', press <Enter>.
  
 9.      If prompted 'Enter the Device you want to print the Install 
 messages. You can queue the install by enter a 'Q' at the device prompt. 
 Enter a '^' to abort the install. DEVICE: HOME//   HOME  (CRT)', press 
 <Enter>.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 The post-installation routine FHP43 runs automatically at the end of the 
 installation. This routine is required by sites that previously installed 
 the FH*5.5*43 patch or used the local Class III modification. The FHP43 
 routine copies existing data to the new BREAKFAST FLAG field (#22), NOON 
 FLAG field (#22.1), and EVENING FLAG field (#22.2) in the NUTRITION 
 PERSON file (#115). The post-installation routine is automatically 
 deleted after execution.
  
 When the site is ready to turn on the patch functionality, the site 
 Nutrition ADPAC should contact the Patch Installer to complete the 
 following steps.
  
 1.      Use the Queued Options Edit [FHQUE OPTION EDIT] option to select 
 the reports to be run, add/change the printer, enable/disable the queue, 
 and select the day(s) and time(s) to run the reports. The ADPAC should 
 determine which reports are needed, the printer to which the reports will
 print, and the day(s) and time(s) to run the reports, if applicable.
  
 Available options are:
     1. FHASNR4         List Inpats By Nutrition Status Level
     2. FHBIR           Birthday List
     3. FHMTKP          Print Tray Tickets
     4. FHORD10         Nutrition Location Diet Order List
     5. FHORD13         Diet Activity Report/Labels
     6. FHORD5          NPO/Pass List
     7. FHORT5S         Tubefeeding Pull Lists
     8. FHORTF5         Preparation/Delivery of Tubefeedings
     9. FHPATM          Patient Movements
  
 2. Immediately after activating the functionality of the reports, the 
 Patch Installer should schedule the Queue Diet Reports [FHQUE QUEUE 
 DIET REPORTS] option in Taskman. This option should be scheduled to run 
 once per day (1d), soon after midnight (T+1@00:10). The installer must 
 also add the name(s) of the Nutrition Manager who is assigned the FHMGR 
 key to the USER TO RUN TASK on the second page of the 
 Schedule/Unschedule option.
  
 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of this patch, it is not recommended for 
 backout, and a restore from a backup of the Transport Global should not 
 be attempted. However, in the event that a site decides to back out this 
 patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit 
 a help desk ticket. The development team will need to issue one or more 
 follow-on patches in order to comprehensively back out this patch, after 
 coordination with the VA Project Manager and COR.
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the FH routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the FH routines have been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain 
 the designation of patch FH*5.5*43 on line 2 in the patch list section.
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out; it does not confirm that other patch component changes 
 have been backed out.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;5.5;DIETETICS;**[Patch List]**;Jan 28, 2005;Build 66
