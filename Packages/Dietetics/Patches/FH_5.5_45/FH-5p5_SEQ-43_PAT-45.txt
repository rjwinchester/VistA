 1.  R18073816FY18 - New Food Allergy
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) Allergy team has recently added 
 ARROWROOT as a food allergy allergies to the GMR ALLERGIES file 
 (#120.82). This new food allergy must be added to the routine FHSELA2 in 
 order to be mapped as allergy type food preference dislikes in the 
 Dietetics package.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine FHSELA2 has a hard coded list of food allergies. It uses this 
 hard coded list to present to the user for adding a food allergy 
 preference dislike to the FOOD PREFERENCES file (#115.2) and then map it 
 to a matching record in the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82). ARROWROOT will 
 be added to the hard coded list of food allergies in routine FHSELA2 so 
 it may be presented to the user.
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital (Madison) 
 VA Western New York HCS

 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation
 of development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision
 between development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should
 have saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the
 Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at
 time of install). The message containing the backed up routines can
 be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action
 prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used
 to install the backed up routines onto the VistA System. 
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2
 lines of the FH Routine contained in this patch using the option
 First Line Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines
 contained in the FH*5.5*45 patch have been rolled back, the first
 two lines of the Routine will no longer contain the designation
 of patch FH*5.5*45 in the patch list section on line 2.
