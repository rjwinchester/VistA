 CA SDM OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. R6557528FY16 - GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82) changes that will require 
    a FH patch 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) Allergy team has recently added 
 MALTITOL, MANNITOL, and XYLITOL as food allergies to the GMR ALLERGY 
 file (#120.82). These new food allergies must be added to the routine 
 FHSELA2 in order to be mapped as allergy type food preference dislikes 
 in the Dietetics package.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine FHSELA2 has a hard coded list of food allergies. It uses this hard
 coded list to present to the user for adding a food allergy preference
 dislike to the FOOD PREFERENCES file (#115.2) and then map it to a
 matching record in the GMR ALLERGY file (#120.89). MALTITOL, MANNITOL, and
 XYLITOL will be added to the hard coded list of food allergies in routine
 FHSELA2 so they may be presented to the user.
  
 2. R7909214FY16 - Incremental Locks are missing timeouts
  
 Problem:
 --------
 During the research for Remedy ticket INC000001039784, the  code checking
 routine ^XINDEX was run on the following routines FHNO%, FHORD7, and 
 FHORD72. All returned "Lock missing Timeout" errors. This is a violation 
 of the VA M Programming Standards and Conventions (SAC) section 2.4.6.1.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch will modify Routines FHNO5, FHORD7, and FHORD72 to include
 timeouts to the incremental locks. This will correct the violations of the
 SAC section 2.4.6.1.
  
 3. R7960069FY16 - GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82) change (SASSFRAS) that will
 require a FH patch.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) Allergy team has recently added 
 SASSAFRAS as a food allergy to the GMR ALLERGY file (#120.82). This new
 food allergy must be added to the routine FHSELA2 in order to be mapped as
 an allergy type food preference dislike in the Dietetics package.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine FHSELA2 has a hard coded list of food allergies. It uses this hard
 coded list to present to the user for adding a food allergy preference
 dislike to the FOOD PREFERENCES file (#115.2) and then map it to a
 matching record in the GMR ALLERGY file (#120.89). SASSAFRAS will be added
 to the hard coded list of food allergies in routine FHSELA2 so it may be
 presented to the user.
