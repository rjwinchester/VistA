Description:
============

 This patch will address the addition of a new Drug/Food allergy by adding 
 CHRYSANTHEMUM to the mapping capability for food preference dislikes.
  
  
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 -------------------------------------------
 1. INC5943993 - FH Patch needed for CHRYSANTHEMUM: A DRUG, FOOD allergy 
 type
  
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 The New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) Allergy team has recently added 
 CHRYSANTHEMUM as a DRUG,FOOD allergy type to the GMR ALLERGIES file 
 (#120.82). It is intended for the tea and herbal supplements made from 
 chrysanthemum. This new DRUG,FOOD allergy type must be added to the 
 routine FHSELA to be mapped as an allergy type food preference dislike in 
 the Dietetics package.
  
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
 Routine FHSELA2 has a hard-coded list of food allergies. It presents this 
 hard-coded list to the user when adding a food allergy preference dislike
 to the FOOD PREFERENCES file (#115.2) and then maps it to a matching
 record in the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82). The new allergy has been added
 to the hard-coded list of food allergies in routine FHSELA2 so that it may
 be presented to the user.

 Canandaigua, Syracuse, Bath, Albany)

        the transport global.
  
     c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
