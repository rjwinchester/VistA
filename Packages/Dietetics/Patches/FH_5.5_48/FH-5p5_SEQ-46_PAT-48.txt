Subject: ADD NEW FOOD ALLERGIES TO FHSELA2

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the addition of new food allergies by adding them
 to the mapping capability for food preference dislikes.
  
  
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 ----------------------------
 HITPS-1123 (formerly PSPO 1380)
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 -------------------------------------------
 1. INC3106807 - New Food Allergy MEAT, MAMMALIAN HOOVED
  
 Problem 1:
 ---------
 The New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) Allergy team has recently added MEAT,
 MAMMALIAN HOOVED as a food allergy to the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82).
 This new food allergy must be added to the routine FHSELA to be mapped as
 an allergy type food preference dislike in the Dietetics package.
  
 Resolution 1:
 ------------
 Routine FHSELA2 has a hard-coded list of food allergies. It presents this 
 hard-coded list to the user when adding a food allergy preference dislike
 to the FOOD PREFERENCES file (#115.2) and then maps it to a matching
 record in the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82). The new allergy has been added
 to the hard-coded list of food allergies in routine FHSELA2 so that it may
 be presented to the user.
  
 Problem 2:
 ---------
 This issue was discovered during SQA testing. The food allergy MEAT, 
 MAMMALIAN HOOVED is added to the FOOD PREFERENCES file (#115.2) as ALLERGY
 - MEAT, MAMMALIAN HOOVED. This is two characters longer than is allowed by
 the data dictionary for the FOOD PREFERENCES file (#115.2). As a result,
 ALLERGY - MEAT, MAMMALIAN HOOVED continues to be presented to the user for
 mapping after it is mapped; instead it should be removed from the
 hard-coded list of food allergies after it's successfully mapped the
 first time.
  
 Resolution 2:
 ------------
 The food allergy name MEAT, MAMMALIAN HOOVED has been shortened to MEAT,
 MAMMAL HOOVED.
  
 2. INC3512723 - New Food Allergy STARFRUIT
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) Allergy team has recently added  
 STARFRUIT as a food allergy to the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82). This new
 food allergy must be added to the routine FHSELA2 to be mapped as an
 allergy type food preference dislike in the Dietetics package.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine FHSELA2 has a hard-coded list of food allergies. It presents this 
 hard-coded list to the user when adding a food allergy preference dislike
 to the FOOD PREFERENCES file (#115.2) and then maps it to a matching
 record in the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82). The new allergy has been added
 to the hard-coded list of food allergies in routine FHSELA2 so that it may
 be presented to the user.
  
 3. INC3974189 - Food allergy reactant reactivated - CANNABIS
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) Allergy team has recently 
 reactivated CANNABIS as a drug food allergy in the GMR ALLERGIES file
 (#120.82). This drug food allergy must be added to the routine FHSELA2 to
 be mapped as an allergy type food preference dislike in the Dietetics
 package.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine FHSELA2 has a hard-coded list of food allergies. It presents this 
 hard-coded list to the user when adding a food allergy preference dislike
 to the FOOD PREFERENCES file (#115.2) and then maps it to a matching
 record in the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82). The reactivated allergy has
 been added to the hard-coded list of food allergies in routine FHSELA2 so
 that it may be presented to the user.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 -----------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes
 to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
    Installation Menu.
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select Backup a Transport Global and when
    prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch FH*5.5*48. This option
    will create a backup message of any routines exported with this patch.
    It will not backup any other changes such as DDs or templates. If for
    any reason the patch is to be rolled back, this backup will be required
    to restore the patch's routine(s) to the pre-installation version(s).
  
 5. From the Installation Menu, you may elect to use the following options.
    When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch: FH*5.5*48 
  
     a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
     
     b. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to print only 
        a summary of the patch, to print a summary of the patch and the
        routines in the transport global, or to print only the routines in
        the transport global.
  
     c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed. (It compares all components of this patch's routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
 6. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    choose the patch to install.
  
 7. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
    respond NO.
  
 8. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
