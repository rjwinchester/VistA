 The following describes each component of the patch:
  
 1) 408113: 
 Issue: Remove session State from URL.
  
 Solution: This has been applied to all variants of the web.config 
 dhb161130.
  
 2) 315292:  
 Issue: 508 Issues on Existing Instrument Pages.
  
 Solution: Added the name of the instrument to the Select button's tooltip.
  
  
 3) 487453: 
 Issue: User can bypass Required selection before you could proceed for 
 Central Iowa users
  
 Solution: Hide the 'Complete' button when the page is in "thinking" mode. 
 This will prevent users from clicking on it and confusing the application.
  
 4)  437595: 
 Issue: DEF_Network Error Displays When No Questions Answered on VA Low
  
 Solution: Check for no questions answered before saving to eliminate 
 divide by zero error.
  
 5) 369611: 
  
 Issue: DEF_BRS Program Type on VA Low Vision Visual Functioning Survey
  
 Solution: Display the question numbers and remove the "Basic Activities" 
 and "Advanced Activities" categories.
  
 6) 487452: 
 Issue: Raw Score and T Score not displayed at the bottom of the form
  
 Solution: On the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 Participation 
 Index (M2PI), the Raw Score and T Score are now displayed at both the top 
 and the bottom of the form, and updated using the same logic. On the Save 
 and Prepare Note field, these values show at the top of the form instead 
 of at the bottom, and the same holds true for the note that is submitted 
 to CPRS - those values show at the top of the form rather than the bottom.
  
 7) 528336:
 Issue:TBI Instruments - CTBIE AND TBI FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT  - Note title 
 is missing from the Summary page, and subsequently not submitted to CPRS.
  
 Solution: Update the code to display the title for the CTBIE and the 
 Follow-Up Assessment notes that are sent over to CPRS.
  
 8) 429985:
 Issue: DEF_Error "String reference not set to an instance of a String. 
 Parameter name: s"
  
 Solution: In Instrument Manager.cs, change the getConsultsFromVIA method 
 to check for a null in the timestamp field of the first consult record 
 returned from the getConsultsForPatient VIA call
  
 9) 325766:
 Issue: TBI Instruments Fortify changes
  
 Solution: All Fortify Release 10 and Release 12 fixes will be tested and 
 implemented in Release 15.  
  
 10) 434544:
 Issue: DEF_Fix Textbox Controls to Process Less Than Character
  
 Solution: The work around for this is to add a blank after every less 
 than (<) character in the Textbox Controls so they are not seen as 
 malicious code. An Error message has been added to trigger to let the 
 user know there should be a space after every less than (<) character.
  
 11) 413870:
 Issue: WASA: TBI: Security Misconfiguration: Web Application Displays 
 Detailed Error Messages
  
 Solution: Modified the <CustomErrors> tag in the web.config file to turn 
 custom errors ON. Modified the existing ErrorPage to not display detailed 
 error messages and log the actual error information to the CRS_DB_LOG 
 database table.
  
 12) 418055:
 Issue: Enable TBI Search Screen Fields
  
 Solution: On 10/19/2016, the stakeholder decided to enable the search 
 fields for non-Admin users.
  
 13) 589678: 
 Issue: Memory Thrashing Issue with Release 15
  
 Solution: Numerous inefficient database calls were replaced with stored 
 procedures. Caching and the use of session variable to minimize database 
 calls were also put into place.
  
 14) 590763: 
 Issue: Replace GetSiteId() with GetSite() - VIA interface update
  
 Solution: The code was updated to call the correct method using the same 
 pattern as our other VIA calls. 
  
 15) 272162: 
 Issue: Add Splash Screen
  
 Solution: Updated the splash screen text in Development and had Doug 
 review.
  
 16) 528292: 
 Issue: Names of the instruments are written in all CAPS and/or the rest 
 combination
  
 Solution: COMPREHENSIVE TBI EVALUTATION, MPAI-4 PARTICIPATION INDEX 
 (M2PI), TBI FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT, and REHABILITAION AND REINTEGRATION 
 PLAN were changed to mixed case.
  
 17) 569335: 
 Issue: Update DBML so manual changes aren't necessary
  
 Solution: A very thorough regression test will need to be performed for 
 this work item.
  
 18) 582170: 
 Issue: Make Reporting tab link configurable (for Pyramid Analytics)
  
 Solution: Updated the application to pull the Pyramid Analytics URL (the 
 one used for the Reporting tab on both Polytrauma and Instruments) from 
 the database as a configuration value. This allows us to use a different 
 Pyramid Analytics URL in our lower environments. Also updated to that 
 both Polytrauma and Instruments open Pyramid Analytics in a new tab 
 rather than hijacking the TBI window.
