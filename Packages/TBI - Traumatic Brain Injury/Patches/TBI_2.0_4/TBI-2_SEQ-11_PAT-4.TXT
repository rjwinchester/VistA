 This patch contains the TBI Work Items completed for this release:
 TBI Patch 2.0*4 Deployment of Sprint 10 Work Items includes the following 
 enhancements and fixes: 
  
 TBI-49685:  Choice Removal/Save Troubleshoot/JScript errors
 TBI-29346: TBI Production Data Update
 TBI-20772: Inconsistent data selection for Cube
  
  
 Patch Components:
 -----------------
 The following describes each component of the TBI Patch 2.0*4
  
 TBI-49685:  Choice Removal/Save Troubleshoot/JScript errors
  
 When DME code was deployed to production new questions and choice id's 
 were added for all new instruments.  A new choice was also added for 
 every radio button element ( 67 questions )  on the existing TBI 
 FOLLOW-UP form.  This choice is titled 'not asked (due to responses to 
 other questions').  This choice has never been visible on this form or 
 selectable by the user.  Since this form was refactored and pulls from 
 the database now, this new choice un-did all front-end logic references. 
 Because indexes are used to 'show/hide' form elements, this extra element 
 threw all 67 radio questions off. 
  
 TBI-29346: TBI Production Data Update
  
 Site was updated to use the Test CPRS account. Until it was corrected, 
 all data entered at the facility via TBI instruments within CPRS was 
 entered into the Pre-Production database.   Since the TBI Instruments URL 
 was updated, the data is going correctly into the Production database.    
 The stakeholder has requested that the data entered into the 
 Pre-production (Test) environment by the facility between be copied from 
 Pre-Production into the Production database. 
  
 To perform this request, below are the required tasks.
  
 1.       Determine which tables/data were affected by TBI instruments 
 updates.
 a.       Look for TBI instrument items entered by this facility.
 b.      The auto-generated primary keys cannot be used as a determining 
 factor.
 2.       Perform analysis of data & records to be transferred 
 (Counts/metrics - used for verification of transfer).
 3.       Create an ETL process to transfer the specified data from the 
 Pre-Production Server to the Production server.
 4.       Test ETL from Pre-Prod (SQL40) to Dev (SQL70)- (db [RegistryQA] 
 -> [registry] (prod copy))
 5.       Compare Counts/Metrics from Pre-Prod (SQL40) to Dev (SQL70) for 
 facility, if same schedule for production. 
 6.       Update connection from Dev (SQL70) to Prod (SQL20).
  
 TBI-20772: Inconsistent data selection for Cube
  
 Stakeholder feedback:
    Dim Institution:  ***Can we group VHA->VISN->Station?
   Dim Patient:
 o Age Group @ Screen Date (should be Evaluation date instead of Screen 
 date)
 o OEF / OIF / OND Roster (Check on numbers.appear to be reversed)
   Dim Question:  Question #, Question Text:  Can these be combined into a 
 single value??
   Dim Time:
 o Month (Can this be displayed as Jan / Feb / Mar / etc. instead of 
 numerically?)
 o Time Key (just display date as all times are 00000000???)
