 Patch Components
 ================
   
 The following describes each component of the TBI Patch 2.0*8
  
 1 - TBI  117419
 Issue: DEF - TBI - UAT - The Satisfaction with Life Scale has the response options as radio buttons which are single numbers.
  
 Resolution:  Create a visual correlation between the numbered radio buttons and the description of each numerical selection for the provider completing the form.
  
 2 -|TAB|TBI 128107
 Issue:  Build.171- An "errorMessage" object has it's value set to "SUCCESS" when the MDWS/VIA operation is successful but later in code logic when a check was done on this "errorMessage", ifnot Null it hides the web page content and displays the
  "errorMessage" value. 
  
 Resolution:  Necessary NULL and "SUCCESS" checks were added to the code.
  
 3 - TBI 132095
 Issue:   TBI - VIA Error in deserializing body of reply message for getConsultsForPatient
  
 Resolution: The TBI web.config maxStringContentLength value was doubled from 8192 to 16384
  
 4 - TBI 133421
 Issue:  When selecting  'NO' to questions  6, 7, and 8 and then allowing  the auto-save to occur, the TBI Follow Up Assessment template defaults to a 'YES' answer for #19 and allows the note to be written to CPRS.  Changing  the response to 19 t
 o 'NO' and back to 'YES' throws a warning message regarding the responses to 6/7/8 and the 'YES' response is cleared.
  
 Resolution: Correct the workflow logic for each response to question 19.
  
 5 - TBI 130230
 Issue: Review Job steps and ETL packages for job SSIS_TBIPolytrauma_GetVistaSites_Monthly_Job in pre-prod and production
  
 Resolution:  The polytrauma patients will be entered by the end users so there is no need for TBI Polytrauma ETL's to be running. Request to have AITC disable the job submitted.
  
 6 - TBI 128109
 Issue:  Builds .171 and .153 - There are no Save or Continue buttons to escape the window.  This error appears in both .153 and .171 Builds
  
 Resolution:  Updated Javascript code in build 174 to display Save/Cancel buttons regardless of answer to Fee Basis question.
  
 7 - TBI 128113
 Issue:   Builds .171 - Get Error Object window, when Link to Encounter Type = Select Scheduled Clinic Appt.  This error appears only in Build .171
  
 Resolution: Modified date format of getVisits() VIA service parameter to yyyymmdd.
  
 8 - TBI 128112
 Issue:  Builds .171 - Save draft without patient information eliminates all data entered.  This error appears only in Build .171
  
 Resolution:  Refactored NET code to use SESSION object on the initial page load and VIEWSTATE for any post backs.
  
 9 - TBI 128114
 Issue:  Builds .171 and .153 - Lose all data when loses focus and autosaves.  This error appears in both .171 and .153. Builds
  
 Resolution: Refactored NET code to use SESSION object on the initial page load and VIEWSTATE for any post backs.
  
 10 - TBI 128217
 Issue:  TBI - CTBIE and/or Rehab/Reintegration Care Plan Instruments are not saving (CTBIE IRCR Templates are not functioning properly) 
  
 Resolution: Refactored .NET code to use SESSION object on the initial page load and VIEWSTATE for any post backs
   
 11 - TBI 138569
 Issue: Code updates to handle new VIA Site Code lookup method
  
 Resolution: VIA code in the TBI InstrumentsManager.cs file has been updated to include the new VIA getSiteId web method call.
 This call will be made before each cprsLaunch call to ensure the correct Site Code/ID
 is being used and the user will be working from/with the appropriate VistA.
  
 12 - TBI 137576
 Issue: Discharge date has been cleared from many patients 
  
 Resolution: Created SQL script for consolidating inactive codes. 
  
 13 - TBI 137581
 Issue: TBI referral logic for the new CRS patient import process
  
 Resolution: Added Drop/Create SQL scripts to database patch list to address the production reports that are missing several stored procedures that support the reports.
  
 14 - TBI 141173
 Issue: TBI - Error writing note to CPRS 
  
 Resolution: Added logic to display the VistA error message when a writeNote fails.
  
 15 - TBI 137638
 Issue: Polytrauma fixes
  
 Resolution: Corrected Admin, export/filtering by PRC/PTRP, and Edit Patient 
 info functionality, and added. Date Picker for Admission/Discharge dates.
  
 16 - TBI 137718
 Issue: TBI Polytrauma - Search and Save Functionality is not working
  
 Resolution: Updated the PolyTrauma Entry form so that when the page initially 
 loads if the PTRP entry type was selected, the PTRP entry form will be 
 visible, (instead of the PRC form). Saved database values that were 
 previously not being retrieved/displayed so the system will now populate 
 entry fields and display to the user.
