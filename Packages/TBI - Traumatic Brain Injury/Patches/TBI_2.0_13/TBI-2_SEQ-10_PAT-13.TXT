 The following describes each component of the TBI Patch 2.0*13 
  
 1) 227782: 
 Issue: Move VIA URI configuration to DB
  
 Solution: The VIA configuration settings were added to the CRS_SETTINGS 
 table. 
  
 2) 260255:  
 Issue: Include client IP address and session information into the 
 comments when writing log information to the database.  Also include the 
 real user ID instead of "TBI LOGGER".
  
 Solution: The client IP, session information and real user ID are now 
 written to the log file to aid in debugging errors.   
  
 3) 238214: 
 Issue: Refactor delete-then-save pattern and refactor page load event to 
 be consistent with other instruments.
  
 Solution: The Mayo-Portland Participation Index instrument was refactored

 data integrity issues.
  
 4) 236129: 
 Issue: TBI - IRCR Survey Data Loss User lost data when saving the IRCR 
 survey.
  
 Solution: The Rehabilitation and Reintegration Plan instrument was 
 refactored to remove the delete-then-save pattern that was causing data 
 loss and data integrity issues. The Auto-Save functionality was changed 
 to be consistent with the other instruments. 
  
 5) 230894:

 Issue: Identify / Correct end user issues with saving CTBIE form (prev 
 197036)

 Solution: Question 19A was fixed to function properly when text was 
 entered into the Other text box.
  
 9)233835:
