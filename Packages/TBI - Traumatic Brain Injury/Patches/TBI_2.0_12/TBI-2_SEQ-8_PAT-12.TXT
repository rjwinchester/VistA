 Patch Components
 ================
   
 The following describes each component of the TBI Patch 2.0*12
  
 1) 193670:  TBI - VIA interface: Update URL to secure https://
 Issue:  
 Need to use the secure URLs for VIA rather than the open ones in
 Development and Pre-Production environments..
  
 Solution: 
 Change "http://" to "https://" in Development and Preproduction
 environments and change <security mode="None"> to <security
 mode="Transport">.
  
 2) 201117:  TBI Polytrauma: Exception setting MaximumValue property of 
 'RangeValidatorTextBoxInjuryDate'
 Issue:
  
 Solution:  
  
 3) 182187 IRCR - TBI/Polytrauma Rehabilitation - note type only allows
 "Initial"
 Issue: 
 After entering an Initial form type, the user was unable to select one
 of the other form options. 
  
 Solution: 
 Correct the defect to permit the user to select any form type after
 the "initial" form is submitted 
  
 4) 182189 TBI System Check - Version and Service Display
 Issue: 
 Recommend revising and adding System Check parameters to the software
 version and service display
 Solution: 
 Modify the System Check Display to include the core code version
 number along with the application build number and to display the
 service being used (VIA or MDWS).  
 5) 182188 TBI - Exception Logging
 Issue: 
 There are places where exceptions are only logged to a file requiring
 a formal request to AITC to retrieve them.  The turnaround time for
 this process adds administrative overhead to resolving defects. 
  
 Solution: 
 Ensuring that all exceptions are logged to the database will expedite
 defect resolutions.
