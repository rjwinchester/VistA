  11. A background job will be tasked when the patch is installed to remove
      the Library files and data. Upon completion of the job, a MailMan 
      message with the subject "Library Package Data & Data Dictionary
      Removal" is generated showing a list of files that were deleted. If
      there are routines that begin with LBR that were not removed, then
      they will be listed in the message. These routines will need to be
      reviewed by IRM to determine if they should be removed. 
      
 12. Any remaining local Library components will need to be manually reviewed
     and removed from each site.
