 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. CA SDM Ticket # I16527050FY17 - Defect#-588507:
    OHRS application no longer has the user's Last, First, Middle Name 
    displayed in the database when managing a system user.
    
 Problem:
 --------
 During 2FA changes for version 1.4.15, the source code to retrieve first,
 middle and last name information from Active Directory (LDAP) was mistakenly
 removed. This introduced an issue within the OHRS application when adding a new
 user or viewing an existing user.  
 
 The user's full name was not displayed on the OHRS screen and was instead
 replaced by the User's Id.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------    
 Code from the previous release (OHRS version 1.4.14) was restored to enable
 retrieval of user information from Active Directory (LDAP).
  
 2.Task-590256:
   Voluntary Service System (VSS) data feed and broken batch job in OHRS
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Voluntary Service System (VSS) data feed and broken batch job in OHRS
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 In order to fix VSS data feed during the execution of the batch process, new
 code was written in. This code would read the filter date from the properties
 file and use this filter date to compose the new filter date for the VSS query.
 
 Note: A deployment strategy was put in place for VSS batch load processing due
 to configuration differences in lower environment; by agreement, testing in
 production.       
  
 3.  Fix Footer with correct Version Information (OHRS)
  
 Problem:
 --------

 Modified the code and the properties file to implement the new version, which

 4.  Fix Footer with correct Version Information (CISS)
  
 Problem:

 5.  Remove references to Remedy (CISS)
    
 Problem:
 --------
 On the CISS-OHRS portal, reference to Remedy Tickets needs to be removed and
