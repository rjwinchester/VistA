 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) INC000001052585 - OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH RECORD-KEEPING SYSTEM - OHRS-Other:
      NSOC WASA Medium Vulnerability:A9: Insufficient Transport Layer Protection 
  
    Problem:
      The CISS-OHRS web application does not contain sufficient transport layer
      protection which makes it available unencrypted Over HTTP (port 80). This 
      security vulnerability allows sniffing of user and patient credentials 
      which contains sensitive information including passwords, PII, SSN, and 
      session cookies. 
 
   Solution: 
       Implement a fix to secure the channel by converting it to SSL via HTTPS.
       HTTPS communication protocol encrypts and decrypts page requests as well 
       as the pages that are returned by the CISS-OHRS Web server. This change
       protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks which will
       also prevent sniffing of user and patient credentials, PII, and SSNs.
