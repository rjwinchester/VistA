 This build corrects 3 issues within the OHRS application and replaces
 Occupational Health Record-Keeping System (OHRS) version 1.4.11.
 
 The three code fixes implemented in this build, OHRS 1.4.12 are:
 
 1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks -
    This fix handles the sanitation and filtering of all user inputs 
    and outputs which prevents cross site scripting to be executed by 
    an attacker which can do harm on the system.
 
 2) Displays Detailed Error Messages -
    This fix removes the detailed error messages getting displayed 
    and instead got replaced by a simple error page.
 
 3) Session Tokens In URL  -

    URL when an error occurs.

 =======================
 1) INC000001052579 - OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH RECORD-KEEPING SYSTEM - OHRS-Other:
       NSOC WASA High Vulnerability: A2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). 
 
    Problem:
     
       Web Application is Vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
          Attacks.
       The web application does not properly sanitize all user input and output. 
       Code can be entered into the URL and run on the user's browser, 
         becoming a reflected XSS attack. 
 
 2) INC000001052586 - OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH RECORD-KEEPING SYSTEM - OHRS-Other:
       NSOC WASA Medium Vulnerability: A6: Security Misconfiguration: 
       Web Application Displays Detailed Error Messages. 
   
    Problem:
    
       The application displays detailed error messages under certain
       conditions, which may provide details about the inner workings of the 
       application to an attacker.
 
 3) INC000001052591  - OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH RECORD-KEEPING SYSTEM - OHRS-Other:
      NSOC WASA Low Vulnerability: A3: Broken Authentication
      and Session Management: Web Application Passes Session Tokens In URL.
    
    Problem:
       The web application sends session ID tokens in the URL whenever there is
       an error or when a user logs out. This can provide user login
       information to the attacker.
