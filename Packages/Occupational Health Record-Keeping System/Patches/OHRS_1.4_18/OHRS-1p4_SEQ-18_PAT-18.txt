Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch announces the National Release of Occupational Health 
 Record-Keeping System (OHRS) version 1.4.18. No additional action is 
 necessary for sites except to communicate the below modifications of OHRS 
 1.4.18 to users. 
  
 The new OHRS 1.4.18 version has been configured for read-only access. 
 Users will no longer be able to create or update data within the 
 application. All write privileges have been removed, and a message has 
 been added to the CISS home page to alert users of the change. 
 Additionally, data updates to and from external systems (e.g., PAID, STS, 
 etc.) have been disabled. Users may still access OHRS to obtain 
 historical information.
