Subject: OHRS 1.4.15 Maintenance Release

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch announces the National Release of Occupational Health Record-Keeping 
 System (OHRS) version 1.4.15. No additional action is necessary for sites 
 except to communicate the below modifications of OHRS 1.4.15 to users. 
  
 The new OHRS 1.4.15 version addresses a new enhancement for Single Sign On 
 Integration (SSOi) with site minder agent/server.  This integration allows user 
 to login with PIV/PIN instead of network ID.
 
 This build provides a new enhancement of Single Sign On (SSOi) using PIV/PIN
 within the OHRS application and replaces Occupational Health Record-Keeping 
 System (OHRS) version 1.4.14.
 
 1) Implement Single Sign On (SSOi) using Site Minder 
  
 Following is the URL for Pre-PROD environment for this SSOi enhancement.

 ASSOCIATED VA MANDATE:
 ======================
 
 The Department of Veterans Affairs Cybersecurity Task Force has been 
 tasked by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Inspector General (IG) 
 to address identified material weaknesses. This task force has mandated that 
 all internal, user facing VA applications become two factor authentication
 (2FA) compliant by April 30, 2017. 
  
 In order to be compliant, applications are required to authenticate users 
 via Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards.  
  
 Note: Usernames and password will no longer be permitted 
 for employees and contractors to access VA applications.

 ENHANCEMENT OVERVIEW:
 =====================
   Problem:
         OHRS - Single Sign On:
         User login using PIV card and PIN instead of network ID
           
   Solution:
       Implement CISS (and its portlet application OHRS) to rely on the SSOi
 service provided by the IAM (Identity Access Management) team to perform user 
 authentications. In order to login to CISS/OHRS, the user is first routed to 
 the VA single sign on page. The user typically authenticates using their PIV 
 card (by entering their PIN number) and by selecting CAB1 certificate, but may 
 choose to use an alternate means of authentication (windows integrated 
 authentication or AD username/password authentication) if approved and
 configured 
 for that user. Once the user is authenticated, the SSOi service redirects the 
 user back into the CISS portal application and provides the user's identity as 
 an HTTP request header attribute to CISS.  The CISS security code extracts this 
 information and proceeds to authorize the user by looking up his/her roles and 
 assigned VA facilities (managed internally by CISS).
