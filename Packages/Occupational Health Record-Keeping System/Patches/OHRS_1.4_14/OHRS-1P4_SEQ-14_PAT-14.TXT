 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) INC000001304015 - OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH RECORD-KEEPING SYSTEM
       - OHRS - Patient Issue:
         Patient information risk profile frequency cannot be changed 
  
     Problem:
       The risk profile is not updating the change in status on the 
       patient information tab. Employee job risks are entered in the 
       Risk Profile in OHRS and several risks can be entered. 
       In the recent ticket, a nurse practitioner was trying to 
       update the status of an EXISTING risk in OHRS, but OHRS 
       didn't save the update. 
  
   Solution:
       The problem on the Risk profile screen has been fixed by 
       modifying the code - to enable the removal of the job risk 
       when the frequency "End risk" is selected.
