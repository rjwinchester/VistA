Description:
============

 This patch will add enhancements to the Inpatient Order Entry routines for
 the National Clozapine Coordination project.  Below is a list of all the 
 applications involved in this project along with their patch numbers:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    MENTAL HEALTH (MH) V. 5.01                            YS*5.01*122
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                       PSO*7*457 
    INPATIENT MEDICATIONS (IP) V. 5.0                     PSJ*5*327
    ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING (OR) V. 3.0             OR*3*427
  
 The patches (YS*5.01*122, PSO*7*457, PSJ*5*327, and OR*3*427) are 
 being released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
 multi-build distribution MENTAL HEALTH NCC PROJECT 5.01.
  
 Abbreviations for terms used in the multi-build patch descriptions 
 include the National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC) located in
 Dallas, Texas; Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC); White Blood Cells (WBC);
 Initial Operating Capability (IOC); and Computerized Patient Record 
 System (CPRS).
  
 The purpose of this software package is to maintain compliance with 
 legislative and federal mandates, as well as to add Clozapine Order
 Checking to the Inpatient Pharmacy application. In addition, this 
 package replaces the weekly roll-up functionality and now transmits 
 data to the National Clozapine server nightly.
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 The routines for the VistA Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option
 will be modified to
  
 1. Add logic to verify that the ordering provider holds the
    YSCL AUTHORIZED key when the pharmacist enters a new 
    Clozapine order in back door pharmacy. If the ordering provider
    does NOT hold the YSCL AUTHORIZED key a message will be
    displayed and will prevent the order from being entered.
  
 2. Add logic to verify that the pharmacist holds the PSOLOCKCLOZ
    key. A local override is needed when the ANC lab values are
    >= 1000 and < 1500. This key will allow the pharmacist to
    perform the override action, if needed.
  
 3. A new routine ^PSJCLOZ will be created to perform various 
    order checks and override functions.
  
 4. A new file CLOZAPINE MEDICATION OVERRIDES (#53.8) will be a
    cloned from the CLOZAPINE PRESCRIPTION OVERRIDE file (#52.52) and
    will hold the override data for Inpatient Medication orders.
  
 5. A new menu PSJL MANAGER (Clozapine Inpatient Medications Manager)
    contains options used to control inpatient Clozapine dispensing.
  
 6. A new option PSJLAB LIST (Display Inpatient Lab Tests and Results)
    displays results of lab tests for patients receiving clozapine as
    required by the circular regarding patient management protocol for
    the use of clozapine. This is for inpatient pharmacy.
  
 7. A new option PSJLIST OVERRIDES (List Inpatient Clozapine Overrides)
    is used to generate a list of inpatient ordered clozapine
    prescriptions entered by overriding the lockout.
  
 8. The new menu PSJU MGR (Unit Dose Medications) is the main menu for
    the Unit Dose Medications software. This menu must be given to all
    Unit Dose Medications users.
  
 9. Add new field CLOZAPINE DOSAGE (MG/DAY) (#301) to the sub-file
    UNIT DOSE (#55.06) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) to hold
    the Clozapine Total Daily Dose verified/entered by the Pharmacist.
