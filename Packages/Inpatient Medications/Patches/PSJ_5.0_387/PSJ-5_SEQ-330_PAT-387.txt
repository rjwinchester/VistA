Subject: CRCL AND CREATININE DISPLAY ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue.
   
 INC2529214 - Code failure during display of CrCL and Creatinine lab 
 results in the patient profile
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 INC2529214 - Code failure or missing data during display of CrCL and
 Creatinine lab results in the patient profile 
           
 Problem: 
 --------
 Inpatient pharmacists at the Pensacola Joint Ambulatory Care Center 
 reported an error in VistA had occurred during display of the patient
 profile.
  
 When a user accesses the following Inpatient menu options;
  
 Inpatient Profile [PSJ PR]
 Order Entry [PSJU NE]
 Action Profile #2 [PSJU AP-2]
  
 A hard stop will occur or data will not be displayed to the user in VistA
 due to an undefined variable ZDSPL. This is caused by code that was
 written in such a way as to not handle all possible combinations of data
 that could be present. The code specifically would not set ZDSPL if the
 CrCL value is equal to "Not Found" and the Creatinine value was equal to
 .01 or if the CrCL was less than 1. The four Inpatient routines involved
 are PSJHEAD, PSJLMHED, PSJCLOR2 and PSGCAPP0 having the same code so the
 same fix could be applied to all four routines.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The resolution for the undefined variable ZDSPL is to update the code to 
 handle all possible data combinations that could exist for CrCL and
 Creatinine results.
    
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed routines PSJHEAD, PSJLMHED, PSJCLOR2 and PSJCAPP0 to format and
 display the CrCL and Creatine lab results in the patient profile and
 correct the undefined variable or un-displayed results.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 It is not necessary to disable any options.  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------ 
 This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize potential
 disruption to users. This patch should take less than 2 minutes to 
 install.
   
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
   
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the  
    Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following
    options.  When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch #  
    (ex. PSJ*5.0*387):
  
    a. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
       is installed. It compares all components of this patch:  routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
       
    b. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
       global.
   
 4. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not backup any
       other changes, such as DDs or templates.
  
  
 5. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    choose the patch to install.
  
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
    NO//" respond NO.  
   
 7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
  
 8. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Post Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 None.
   
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;5.0;INPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;16 DEC 97;[BUILD NUMBER]
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed-up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
