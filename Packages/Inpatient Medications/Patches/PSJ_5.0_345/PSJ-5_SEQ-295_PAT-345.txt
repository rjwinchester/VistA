 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 I15384375FY17 - PSJI BACKGROUND JOB is not producing the Missing Dose
                 Information e-mail
  
 Problem
 --------
 The PSJI BACKGROUND JOB has a few issues that are being addressed in this 
 patch.  The first issue is that the Missing Cost Information e-mail is 
 never getting generated.  The other issue is that the IV STATS file 
 (50.8) is not being handled correctly.  If an additive or solution is 
 missing its AVERAGE DRUG COST value, then its dispensing  information is 
 never recorded and, even though the cost is added at a later date, it 
 will not get retroactively added nor will recompilation of the IV Stats 
 File report recover this data.
  
 Resolution
 -----------
 The routine PSIVSTAT was modified to handle these issues.  First off, the
 temp global ^TMP("PSIVNC",$J was incorrectly having the data stored to
 ^TMP($J,"PSIVNC", which is why the report never ran and the Transaction
 node in the IV STATS file was always getting deleted.
  
 When exiting this process, the TMP Global was not getting killed because
 of a typo.

 POST INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
 A test site reported that the Missing Cost Information e-mail was not 
 sent even after the patch was installed which was fixed by rescheduling 
 the background job.  Although the background job should be working 
 properly at most sites, as a preventative measure, sites should delete 
 and reschedule the PSJI BACKGROUND JOB option in order to ensure it is 
 queued correctly. This should be rescheduled using "Schedule/Unschedule 
 Options" [XUTM SCHEDULE] and should be rescheduled with the same 
 parameters.
