Description:
============

 This patch is part of MOCHA 2.0 POST RELEASE FOLLOW UP 1.0 build that 
 includes PSJ*5*311 and PSO*7*436.
  
 This patch PSJ*5*311 corrects the following issue:
  
 1. Remedy Ticket #1008789 - A site found that an error occurred when
 entering a new clinic using the CLINIC DEFINITION [PSJ CD] option.  The
 error does not occur when the user edits an existing clinic.
  
 The PSJIMO1 routine has been modified to pass the ADMINISTER INPATIENT
 MED? parameter which is used to determine if the clinic is an Inpatient
 Medication for Outpatient (IMO) clinic. This value is used by the system
 to evaluate whether the user modified the value for the IMO DC/EXPIRED DAY
 LIMIT prompt.  Depending on the action taken by the user, the 
 system defines or deletes the CIMOU, CIMOI or CIMO cross reference for use
 during order checking for clinic orders.  Additionally a post install 
 routine PSJ311PO will run to re-build the CIMOU, CIMOI, CIMO, CIMOCLU and 
 CIMOCLI cross references for PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) and NON-VERIFIED
 ORDERS file (#53.1).
