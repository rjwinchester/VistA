Subject: START DATE ISSUE/CLINIC ORDER/ORDER FREQUENCY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following issues.
  
 1. INC3307676-Inconsistency on updating start date when editing a starred
    field and a non-starred field depending on when you perform the edit.
  
 2. INC3400229-Patient on Specific Drugs (PSD) Not Displaying Clinic Order
    When Division Selected.
  
 3. INC3835935-Order changed in VistA, creating a new order. Bar Code 
    Medication Administration (BCMA) does not show the new active order;
    only shows discontinued order.
  
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 ----------------------------- 
 HITPS-6504:  Inpatient Medication Orders with Invalid Frequency Do Not 
 Populate on BCMA's Virtual Due List
  
 Summary: Where the medication route is edited, a new order is created. 
 The new order does not contain a valid Frequency, and, therefore, cannot 
 be displayed on BCMA's Virtual Due List (VDL). This problem occurs when a 
 user is set to Auto-Verify inpatient med orders.
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC3307676 - There is an inconsistency for updating start date when 
                 editing a starred field and a non-starred field depending
                 on when you perform the edit.
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 It was reported that after editing the Start Date/Time field for an
 IV-Inpatient order and then modifying the Administration Times field via
 Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option for the second order of the same 
 medication, the Start Date/Time gets changed automatically to something 
 else other than what was entered. This happens when the two fields are
 edited simultaneously. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A change was made to the intravenous (IV) Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE]
 option to prevent re-calculation of the Start Date/Time when the field is
 manually being edited by the user.
  
 The routine PSGOEF has been modified at line tag FINISH+2 to re-initialize
 the PSIVCAL variable.
  
  
 2. INC3400229 - PSD Not Displaying Clinic Order When Division Selected
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Orlando Inpatient staff identified an issue when using the Patients on
 Specific Drug(s) [PSJ PDV] option to list orders of selected patient 
 where certain Clinic Orders are not displayed if the user selects a
 specific division. If the user does not pre-select a specific Division and
 instead accepts the default of ALL Divisions the Clinic Order will appear.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The logic of the Patients on Specific Drug(s) report has been modified to 
 include the Inpatient clinic orders when generating the report for a 
 specific division.
  
  
 3. INC3835935 - Order changed in VistA, creating a new order. BCMA does
    not show the new active order; only shows discontinued order
  
    INC2390586 - TVH -- Invalid Frequency received from order (Duplicate)
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 The Tennessee Valley Healthcare System - Alvin C. York (Murfreesboro) 
 Campus and VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System H.J. Heinz Campus sites
 reported issues with orders disappearing from BCMA right after being
 finished by pharmacy. 
  
 It was determined that the cause of the problem is that the FREQUENCY 
 (in minutes) (#42) field in the UNIT DOSE (#55.06) sub-file in the
 PHARMACY PATIENT (#55) file was getting deleted after the MED ROUTE (#3) 
 field was edited prior or after finishing a pending unit dose order from
 CPRS when the Auto-Verify parameter for the user performing the edit is
 set to YES.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changed the software to preserve the variable used to store the order 
 frequency value after the MED ROUTE (#3) field is edited. 
  
 NEWed the variable PSGS0XT at 3^PSGOE8 and 3^PSGOE9. This variable is 
 used to store the Order frequency and was being overwritten after the MED
 ROUTE (#3) field was being edited, which is handled by these two entry
 points.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes
 to install.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu. From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch
     (ex. PSJ*5*380):
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  Select the installation option Backup a Transport Global. This 
     option will create a backup message of any routines exported with 
     this patch in case you need to back-out this patch. It will not backup
     any other changes such as Data Dictionaries (DD's) or templates. It 
     is important this step be followed, because if back-out of this patch 
     is necessary, having the backup will make the process much easier.
  
 5.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//', answer 'NO'.  
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//', answer 'NO'
  
 8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//', answer 'NO'.
  
 9.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//', respond 0.
  
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
