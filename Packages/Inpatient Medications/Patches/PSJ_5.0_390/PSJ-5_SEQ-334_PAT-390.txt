 1. INC5234880  Pre-Exchange DOSES issue
    
 Problem: 
 ========
 An issue was discovered with an Outpatient Clinic order when the clinic and the
 medication are both tied to a PADE device on the patients previous ward.  If
 the patient was previous admitted to a ward then obtained a clinic order for a
 PADE medication, the Pre-Exchange DOSES default value will display differently
 based on the Inpatient Ward Parameters Edit opton  (PSJ IWP EDIT). 
  
 It was also noticed that the message "The dispense drug for this order is a
 PADE item"  would only display if the patients prior ward parameter was set to
 YES.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification will be made to routine PSGPEN to ensure that clinic orders
 display the appropriate Pre-Exchange values and the message "The dispense drug
 for this order is a PADE item" if the clinic and medication are tied to a PADE
 device. 
  
  
 2. INC5915715- Clinical orders not discontinued for deceased patients
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 Upon the entry of a date of death for a patient the patient's active 
 clinical orders (IMO) are not being discontinued.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The process has been modified to allow the process to discontinue all of 
 the active clinical orders for a patient when a date of death is entered 
 via VA Fileman.

 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from this patch description.
