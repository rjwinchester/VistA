 Remedy Overview:
 ===============
 1)  INC000000905936
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When the Dispense Drug of an active Unit Dose order is modified in 
   Vista, there is no activity log entry to reflect the change.  
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Modified routine PSGAL5 to store an Activity Log entry in the Pharmacy
   Patient File (#55) when the Dispense Drug is modified.  Also modified 
   PSGOE92 so that after several Dispense Drug changes, each activity log 
   will only show the prior dispense drug as opposed to concatenating them 
   together.
  
  
 2) INC000000964470
  
   Problem:
   -------
   In VistA, pharmacy is seeing old, expired orders showing as Active.  
   This is due to 2 variables (Q & QQ ) getting overwritten by other called
   routines.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Modified routine PSJO1 to change the variable Q and QQ to be PSJOQ and
   PSJOQQ. 
  
  
 3) INC000001104816
  
   Problem:
   -------
   Unit Dose prescriptions that are finished using the "Speed Finish"
   functionality in the option INPATIENT ORDER ENTRY [PSJ OE] are having
   attributes from IV prescriptions copied into them.  This is due to some 
   variables that were not cleaned up from the previous order.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   After exiting the INPATIENT ORDER ENTRY option, any remaining variables
   will now be cleaned up so they are not around when another option is 
   invoked.
  
  
 4) INC000001123236
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When verifying a pending Unit Dose order that has a PRN Schedule, where 
   there is no Frequency defined, the user is getting the incorrect prompt:
   'Pre-Exchange DOSES: OI//', indicating it is invalid.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Routine PSGPL0 was modified so that when a Schedule Type of PRN is used 
   and there is no frequency defined in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file 
   (#51.1), the order is given the correct Pre-Exchange DOSES prompt.
