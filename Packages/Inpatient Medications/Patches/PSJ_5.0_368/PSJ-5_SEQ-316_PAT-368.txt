Subject: ISSUE WITH INPATIENT ORDER SET WITH PATCH MEDICATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue.
  
 INC1065553 - Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) Backup System
 (BCBU) Medication Administration Record (MAR) display NON transdermal
 patch orders with Removal times discharged/deceased
 INC0608952 - *TEST ACCOUNT-BCMA listing all admins as a patch-TEST ACCOUNT*
 (Duplicate)
     
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 INC1065553 - BCBU MAR display NON transdermal patch orders with Removal
              times discharged/deceased
 INC0608952 - *TEST ACCOUNT-BCMA listing all admins as a patch-TEST ACCOUNT*
 (Duplicate)
         
 Problem: 
 --------
 When Inpatient Pharmacy users use the option Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE]
 and instead of ordering a single medication choose an order set, there is
 a potential mix up between patch medications and other medications 
 that have a different form of administration. Order sets are created via
 the Order Set Enter/Edit [PSJU OSE] option. In some circumstances patch
 medications will not have a field for entering removal times and in others
 medication with other forms of administration will prompt BCMA users for
 an application site, which is required only for patch medications.
       
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Reset variables that identify patch medication versus non patch medication
 before processing each order within the order set. This will prevent orders
 following a patch medication order from being flagged as patch as well.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 NEWed the variable PSGRF and ND2P1 variables at GND+1^PSGOES and set the 
 variable PSGRF with the content of the PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA (#12)
 field in the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM (#50.7) file, which is used to
 identify whether form of application for the medication being entered is a
 patch.

 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no
