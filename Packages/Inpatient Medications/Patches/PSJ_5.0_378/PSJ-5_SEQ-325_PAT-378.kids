Problem: 
"BLD",10942,1,12,0)
--------
"BLD",10942,1,13,0)
The Robley Rex VA Medical Center reported that medication orders are showing
"BLD",10942,1,14,0)
start date/times BEFORE the signature date/time of the order. This causes
"BLD",10942,1,15,0)
meds to be due for administration in BCMA for a past time when the order did
"BLD",10942,1,16,0)
not even exist. It appears as though patients are missing meds. Thus far
"BLD",10942,1,17,0)
orders have been isolated to our 4S MED hospital ward and all identified
"BLD",10942,1,18,0)
orders have been in the Unit Dose package.

Resolution:

-----------
"BLD",10942,1,22,0)
The primary reason the Robley Rex VAMC experienced this problem is because
"BLD",10942,1,23,0)
the 4S MED was not configured in the Inpatient Ward Parameters Edit [PSJ IWP
"BLD",10942,1,24,0)
EDIT] option where the parameter DEFAULT START DATE CALCULATION used to
"BLD",10942,1,25,0)
calculate the default start date/time for an order is set. The other reason
"BLD",10942,1,26,0)
is that once they processed two orders at the same time for the same ward
"BLD",10942,1,27,0)
the default value for the parameter was getting overwritten when they tried
"BLD",10942,1,28,0)
to finish the second order. This patch corrects this issue.

Technical Resolution:

---------------------
"BLD",10942,1,32,0)
Changed the line ENSD+99^PSGNE3 to check only the 5th piece of the PSJSYSW0
"BLD",10942,1,33,0)
variable since it contains all ward parameters and after the user finished
"BLD",10942,1,34,0)
