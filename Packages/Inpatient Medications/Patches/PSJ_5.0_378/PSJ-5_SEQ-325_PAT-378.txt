Subject: UNIT DOSE START/DATE TIME CALCULATION WRONG

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue.
  
 INC2264488 - Medication order start times and BCMA admin times are before the
              date/time the order was signed
      
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 INC2264488 - Medication order start times and BCMA admin times are before the
              date/time the order was signed
          
 Problem: 
 --------
 The Robley Rex VA Medical Center reported that medication orders are showing
 start date/times BEFORE the signature date/time of the order. This causes
 meds to be due for administration in BCMA for a past time when the order did
 not even exist. It appears as though patients are missing meds. Thus far
 orders have been isolated to our 4S MED hospital ward and all identified
 orders have been in the Unit Dose package.
       
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The primary reason the Robley Rex VAMC experienced this problem is because
 the 4S MED was not configured in the Inpatient Ward Parameters Edit [PSJ IWP
 EDIT] option where the parameter DEFAULT START DATE CALCULATION used to
 calculate the default start date/time for an order is set. The other reason
 is that once they processed two orders at the same time for the same ward
 the default value for the parameter was getting overwritten when they tried
 to finish the second order. This patch corrects this issue. 
   
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Changed the line ENSD+99^PSGNE3 to check only the 5th piece of the PSJSYSW0
 variable since it contains all ward parameters and after the user finished
 the first order it was getting set with multiple up-carets ("^^^^^^^^^^").

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 It is not necessary to disable any options.  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------ 
 This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize potential
 disruption to users. This patch should take less than 2 minutes to install.
   
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
   
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the  
    Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following
    options.  When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch #  
    (ex. PSJ*5.0*378):
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not backup any
       other changes, such as DDs or templates.
    
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
       is installed. It compares all components of this patch:  routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
       
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you

 Post Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 None.
  
   
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;5.0;INPATIENT MEDICATIONS;**[PATCH LIST]**;[DATE];[BUILD NUMBER] 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
