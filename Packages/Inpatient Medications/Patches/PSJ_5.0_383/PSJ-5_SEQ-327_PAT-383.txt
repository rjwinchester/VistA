 INC3322701  Copied provider comments no longer display on the orders tab 
             in CPRS when pharmacist edits starred (*) field with Auto-Verify ON
 INC3386455(d)   
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 
 A site has reported that when a pharmacist edits a starred(*) field
 for an order, the provider comments are not displaying on the Orders tab
 in CPRS.  This only happens when auto-verify is ON.
 
 Non-BCMA areas rely on CPRS for provider comments.
 
 
 Resolution:
 ===========
  
 A modification was made to routine PSJBCMA5 to check the auto-verify setting
 when working with the provider comments so they are properly sent back over
 to CPRS.

 Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------ 
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 2

        options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch 
        PSJ*5.0*383.
  
   a.   Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message of
        any routines exported with this patch. It will not backup any other 
        changes such as DDs or templates.
  
   b.   Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow
        you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed.  (It compares all components of this patch routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from this patch description.
