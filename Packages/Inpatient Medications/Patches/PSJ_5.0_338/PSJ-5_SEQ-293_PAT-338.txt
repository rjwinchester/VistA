 Issue 1
 --------
 I9190964FY16       UNDEFINED error when renew is changed to copy an order
   
 Problem: 
 ========
 A unit dose inpatient order in Vista was selected to be renewed (RN).  At the
 STOP DATE/TIME display the user realized they didn't want to renew the order
 but to copy it.  Entering an up-caret (^) at this point will take the user
 back to the originally selected order with no changes made.  The user then
 enters CO (copy) and attempts to copy the order.  During the copying
 process the user receives the <UNDEFINED>INIT+58^PSJLMUDE error and is
 taken out of Vista. 
  
 During the RENEW process some of the values in the INPATIENT USER PARAMETERS
 FILE (#53.45), which contains information about the displayed order, are
 killed off.  When the user decided/realized they wanted the order copied
 and not renewed, some of the pertinent information that was removed was
 not getting set back into this file.  This is the reason the user received
 the UNDEFINED error.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to MOVE^PSGOER to ensure that the INPATIENT USER
 PARAMETERS FILE (#53.45) is populated with all the correct information for
 processing.
  
 Issue 2
 --------
 R11878202FY17       Unit dose order has zero for dosage.
   
 Problem: 
 ========
 An active unit dose order in Vista was modified by changing the Orderable
 Item. When this is done, both the Orderable Item and Dosage Ordered are 
 deleted. When entering the new Orderable Item, the user is not prompted 
 for the Dosage Ordered and is able to accept the order.  This results in
 the new order being created without a Dosage Ordered. If there is only
 one Dispense Drug for the newly entered orderable item, the prompt for 
 Dosage Ordered is not displayed. This is current functionality.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Modifications were made to 6 routines, PSGOE8, PSGOE9, PSJOE1, PSJLMUDE,
 PSJDOSE & PSGOEE.
 These modifications will prompt the user to enter a Dosage Ordered when
 they change the Orderable Item unless there is only one Dispense Drug for
 the entered Orderable Item.
  
  
 Issue 3
 --------
 I8405721FY16        Copied UD order with >1 dispense drug, one
                     inactive, copies incorrectly.
  
 Problem:
 ========
 A Unit Dose order that has more than one Dispense Drug associated
 with it, one being inactive, will not copy correctly.  
  
 When the order is copies, the inactive Dispense Drug(s) are not
 supposed to be copied to the new order.  If the inactive Dispense
 Drug is the first one then the second Dispense Drug will show
 on the new copied order twice.  If the inactive Dispense Drug is
 last it will show on the copied order.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routine PSGOD to remove the inactive
 Dispense Drug from the INPATIENT USER PARAMETERS FILE (#53.45).
  
  
 Issue 4:
 --------
 I12228956FY17     "^" at Duration of Admin still allows order to 
                     continue
  
 Problem:
 ========
 A user went to edit an active Transdermal Inpatient order, and the 
 Pharmacy Orderable Item is marked for PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA (value 
 2 or 3) and the Dosage form is Patch.  During the edit of the verified 
 order the user aborts ("^") at the Duration of Administration prompt 
 after entering the admin times. The system will allow the creation of 
 the new order without the Duration of Administration being entered.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification to PSGOEE to prevent the user from continuing to create
 a new order without the required Duration of Administration value.
  
  
 Issue 5:
 ---------
 I15018816FY17     UNDEFINED error in PSJDOSE when modifying Dosage.
  
 Problem:
 ========
 An active unit dose order in VistA was modified by changing the Dosage
 Ordered field.  When the dosage options/selections appeared, the user
 opted to enter a free text dosage that exceeded 15 characters.  This
 resulted in the UNDEFINED error.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routine PSJDOSE to ensure that the user will
 no longer receive the UNDEFINED error.  
  
 This modification will send the user back to the dosage prompt if the value
 exceeds 15 characters.
  
 Issue 6:
 ---------
 I13103401FY17     Dispense drug not deleting correctly while finishing
                    complex orders
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 An Inpatient Med complex order was created in CPRS.  While finishing
 the order in Vista, the Pharmacist adds a new Dispense Drug (12) to the
 order then deletes the original Dispense Drug.  Once the order is
 completed and you go back into the order, both the new and deleted
 Dispense Drugs are displayed.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification is needed in routine PSJCOM to update the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS
 FILE (53.1) with the new Dispense Drug information.
