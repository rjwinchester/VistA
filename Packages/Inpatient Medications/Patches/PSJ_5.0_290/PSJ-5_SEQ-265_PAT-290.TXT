 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) INC000000403854 - '...Order deleted' was display in the order view screen 
    when copying active IV order
  
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The problem occurs when copying an IV order using Inpatient Order Entry
    [PSJ OE] option.  When the user selects a verified IV order and chooses
    'CO' to copy the order and when prompted, "Do you want to copy this
    order?", answers 'Yes', after processing order checks, the text
    '...Order deleted' will be displayed.  This message should not be
    displayed as nothing is actually being deleted and this causes
    confusion for the end users.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSIVORE2 has been modified to stop the '...Order deleted' message 
    from being displayed when there is no actual order being deleted.
  
 2) INC000000707885 - Question regarding "Last Transferred" field in
                      demographic header.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When an interward transfer is entered and then deleted, the Last
    Transferred field in the demographic header still shows the deleted
    transfer date and not the most recent actual transfer.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSJADT has been modified to update the UD LAST TRANSFERRED DATE
    field (#62.04) in the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).
