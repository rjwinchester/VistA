Subject: IV Additive Quick Code Issue / Expected First Dose

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 1)     IV Additive Quick Code Display 
 2)     Expected First Dose
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1)  CA-SDM I17911866FY18       
  
 IV Additive Quick Code is not displaying correctly
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 The IV Additive Quick Code does not display the dosage and is showing
 up during order processing as Additive Strength: QC when it should be
 displaying as a Quick Code strength:nnn MG (where nnn is the strength of
 the quick code) and schedule.
  
 Currently a quick code is showing up, for example, "Additive Strength: QC 1" 
 The Quick Code, for example, should be displayed as "Quick Code Strength:400
 MG SCHEDULE: Q12H".
  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routines PSIVORC2 and PSIVEDRG to grab the strength
 and Schedule of the quick code and display it as such.
  
  
 2)  CA-SDM  I12286607FY17
  
 Expected First Dose 
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The Exit Action on PSJ LM UD ACTION is currently set to S VALMBCK="Q".
 This allows variable carry-over into subsequent orders. The problem at
 its source is that the List Manager screen does not kill the variables
 it sets for orders after it displays an order.  This leaves leftover
 variables in the next order, namely PSGOST, and results in an incorrect
 "Expected First Dose" calculation / display when the Schedule is
 greater than Daily and the Start Date is in the future.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Modify the Exit Action for List Manager PSJ LM UD ACTION from
 S VALMBCK="Q" TO D ENKILL^PSJLMUDE S VALMBCK="Q".  Routine ^PSGOE7
 must also be modified to D ENKILL^PSJLMUDE, because auto-verified
 orders do not follow the same List Manager flow. 
  
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 Orlando VA Medical Center
 Oklahoma City VA Medical Center
  
 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 NOTE TO INSTALLER:
 There will be an XINDEX error on routine PSIVEDRG for a missing label 
 when this patch is installed.  This will not cause any issue for users 
 since the missing label, IVSOL^PSGSICHK, is never called due to a QUIT at 
 ORDERCHK+3^PSIVEDRG.  This will be corrected in a future patch.
  
 No options need to be disabled.  It is best to install this patch during
 non-peak hours.  
  
 This patch should take less than 2 minutes to install.
  
  
 1.     Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.     Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3.     From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
        Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following
        options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch 
        (PSJ*5.0*355).
  
   a.   Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message of
        any routines exported with this patch. It will not backup any other 
        changes such as DDs or templates.
  
   b.   Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow
        you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed.  It compares all components of this patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.)
  
  
   c.   Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you to
        ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
 4.     From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
        choose the patch to install.
  
 5.     When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//'
        enter NO.
  
 6.     When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
         Protocols? NO//' enter NO.
  
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 ===============================
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;5.0;INPATIENT MEDICATIONS;**[PATCH LIST]**;[DATE];[BUILD #] 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 ====================
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 The List Manager change can be backed out via the following FileMan
 procedure:
  
 VA FileMan 22.2
  
 Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES  
  
 Input to what File: LIST TEMPLATE// LIST TEMPLATE    (733 entries)
 EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// EXIT CODE  
 THEN EDIT FIELD: 
  
 Select LIST TEMPLATE NAME: PSJ LM UD ACTION  
 EXIT CODE: D ENKILL^PSJLMUDE S VALMBCK="Q"  Replace D ENKILL^PSJLMUDE 
 With 
   Replace 
     S VALMBCK="Q"
  
 (Note:  Replace the D ENKILL^PSJLMUDE statement with "nothing" / <Enter> 
         -- This will remove the newly added code.)
        
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
 ==================================
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSJ*5.0*355 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSJ*5.0*355 in
 the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;5.0;INPATIENT MEDICATIONS;**[Patch List]**;16 DEC 97;Build 4

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.
