Associated patches: (v)PSJ*5*315   <<= must be installed BEFORE `PSJ*5*334'

Subject: TRANSDERMAL EMERGENCY PATCH

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch PSJ*5.0*334 will correct the exception handling for Duration of
 Administration to enforce integer only values. Patch PSJ*5.0*315
 introduced code into three routines that prompt for Duration of
 Administration.  The code originally blocked the use of non-integer
 entries, but other changes to code caused this to stop working, so that
 Decimal values can be entered (such as 23.5).  This will not compute
 correctly.  Patch PSJ*5.0*334 corrects this by making changes to allow the
 code to enforce the integer only requirement.
  
 *NOTE*: This patch is a follow-up for patch PSJ*5.0*315 to fix the noted
 issue.  However, there is an issue for BCMA which is part of this 
 enhancement that needs to be noted.  
  
      For non-standard schedules such as DAY@HHMM, HHMM or other odd 
 schedules, Removal Times cannot be calculated due to the lack of a 
 Frequency. Regardless of the Prompt for Removal in BCMA code value for 
 the orderable item, no Removal Times will display in BCMA for these 
 non-standard schedules. These types of schedules must be avoided for 
 Medications Requiring Removal (MRR) orders.

 R10757134FY16: Entry of 23.5 at Duration of Administration Prompt 
 produces bad calculation for time.
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Problem occurred when a site decided to enter 23.5 hours in at the 
 Duration of Administration prompt.  This resulted in an incorrect removal 
 time. Only Integer values are permitted.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routines PSGOE41, PSGOE81 and PSGOE91 had a change to conditional logic 
 that allows pattern match code to enforce the integer requirement.  
 Previously this code had become isolated and was not being executed when 
 needed.
