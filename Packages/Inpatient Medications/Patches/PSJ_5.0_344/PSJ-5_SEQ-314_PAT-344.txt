Subject: UNDEFINED w/COPY/ Clinic IMO Order /Missing Actions

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses four (4) issues:
  
  
 1.  An UNDEFINED error is happening when copying a UD order, the user
     changes the Orderable Item but "^" out at the dispense drug selection
     all the way back to the profile, then picks another order to copy.
  
 2.  A Clinic IMO order could not be processed.  The site was turned off
     for Inpatient Meds between the time the order was placed and when it
     was processed by pharmacy.
  
 3.  A Non-Verified IV order was modified, a non-starred field, then another 
     non-starred field was selected but the user cancelled the action (^).  
     After the user Accepted the change the screen displayed the patient 
     profile and not the accepted order to be verified.  (PSPO 3653)
  
 4.  The verify action is not enabled immediately when a user accepts a 
     unit dose order after verifying an iv fluid order for a different 
     patient. Instead, the profile screen is displayed without the verify
     action.

 1. Problem:
 -----------
 When copying an active UD order and changing the orderable item to
 an orderable item with multiple dispense drugs, the user "^" out
 at the Select DISPENSE DRUG(S) for this order all the way back 
 to the profile screen and selects a different active UD order and
 proceeds to copy it as they did with the first order.  An undefined
 error will occur when you attempt to change the orderable item on the
 second order.
  
 This is happening because the variable PSGOROE1 is not getting killed
 after the first order.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A modification was made to routine PSJOE in tag NEWSEL to kill the 
 variable PSGOROE1.
  
 2. Problem: 
 -----------
 A Clinic IMO was created for an outpatient.  Before the pharmacist
 was able to process the pending order the IMO Clinic site was turned
 off for Inpatient Meds.  When attempting to process the order they 
 received a screen message "Cannot process an Out-patient Unit Dose 
 order for..."
  
 This situation only happens when the outpatient patient had a prior
 admission to a VA facility.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A modification was made to routine PSJOE to allow the processing of
 The pending order.
  
 3. Problem:
 -----------
 (PSPO 3653)
  
 A Non-Verified IV order was modified, a non-starred field, then
 another non-starred field was selected but the user cancelled the 
 action (^).  After the user accepted the change the screen 
 displayed the patient profile and not the accepted order to be 
 verified.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A modification was made to routine PSJLIACT to allow the display 
 of the accepted non-verified order so it can be verified.
  
 4. Problem:
 -----------
 When a user finishes, accepts and verifies an inpatient order for
 iv fluids for an inpatient and then in the same ordering session 
 performs the following sequence for a different patient with a unit 
 dose order: finishes, edits a field and then accepts the order, the 
 screen navigates back to the patient profile screen instead of 
 allowing the user to verify the unit dose order.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A modification was made to DISACTIO^PSJOE to remove a flag that 
 identifies an order as an IV fluid order when the current order 
 being processed is a unit dose order.

 -------------------------------
  
 Installation Verification:
 ------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;5.0;INPATIENT MEDICATIONS;**[PATCH LIST]**;[DATE];[BUILD NUMBER] 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
