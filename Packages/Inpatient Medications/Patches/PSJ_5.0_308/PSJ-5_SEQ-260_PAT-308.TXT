 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC0000000970510 - Bar Code Med Admin - Medication History Issue:
    
    Problem:
    --------
    Orders are missing from the MAH in both BCMA/CPRS when the order is a
    "one time" dose and is tied to a clinic that is not in the CLINIC
    DEFINITION file (#53.46) with the patient no longer an inpatient.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The routine PSJBCMA was modified to return historical data if the
    patient was admitted during the frame of the report.
  
  
 2. INC00000000970511 - Bar Code Med Admin - Clinic Orders: 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The "Edit Med Log" option in the BCMA Graphic User Interface (GUI) will
    return an undefined error when the order is tied to a clinic that is
    not in the CLINIC DEFINITION file (#53.46) and the patient is no longer
    an inpatient.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine PSJBCMA to return patient data if the patient was 
    admitted when the med log entry was recorded.
  
 3. INC00000000961141 - Inpatient Medications - Receiving Error 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the MAH in BCMA an undefined error is returned when the
    order is tied to a clinic that is not in the CLINIC DEFINITION file
    (#53.46) and the patient is no longer an inpatient.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The routine PSJBCMA was modified to return historical data if the
    patient was admitted during the time frame of the report.
  
 4. INC000000982669 - <UNDEFINED>GETPRNS+58^PSBPRN *PSBOIT
  
    Problem:
    --------
    An Undefined error occurs if one of these "Hybrid" orders
    (Inpatient Med tied to Clinic, but not an appointment) is a PRN,
    which requires a PRN Effectiveness, but has not yet had one entered.
    Once the patient is discharged, an undefined error will occur when 
    trying to access the patient in BCMA.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The routine PSJBCMA was modified to return historical data if the 
    patient was admitted during the frame of the report and if that
    patient has a PRN order.
