Description:
============

 The Pharmacy Interface Automation Project (PIA) will provide a new
 standard bi-directional Health Level Seven (HL7) to the Pharmacy
 Automated Dispensing Equipment (PADE) server. The PADE will route the
 message to a cabinet located at the point of care areas such as Inpatient
 wards, Outpatient Clinics etc.
  
 The following two patches are provided for this project:
   PSJ*5*317 - Inpatient Medications V. 5.0.
   PSS*1*193 - Pharmacy Data Management V. 1.0.
  
 Note: The patches should be installed in the order listed above as the 
 logical link, PSJ PADE used in the PSS patch is transported in the PSJ
 patch.
  
 1.  The following new files were created:
     PADE SYSTEM SETUP file (#58.7)
     PADE SEND AREA file (#58.71)
     PADE OUTBOUND MESSAGES file (#58.72)
     PADE INVENTORY SYSTEM file (#58.601) 
     PADE INBOUND TRANSACTIONS file (#58.6)
     PADE DISPENSING DEVICE file (#58.63)
     PADE USER file (#58.64)
     
 2.  A new menu, PADE Main Menu [PSJ PADE MAIN MENU], with the following
     options was created:
     PADE Send Area Setup [PSJ PADE SEND AREA SETUP] option
     PADE System Setup [PSJ PADE SETUP] option
     PADE Send Surgery Cases [PSJ PADE SEND SURGERY CASES] option
     PADE Send Patient Orders [PSJ PADE SEND ORDERS] option
     PADE Inventory Setup [PSJ PADE INVENTORY MENU] option
        ...Inventory System Setup [PSJ PADE INVENTORY SYSTEM] option
        ...Dispensing Device Setup [PSJ PADE DEVICE SETUP] option
     PADE Reports [PSJ PADE REPORTS MENU] option
        ...PADE On-Hand Amounts [PSJ PADE INVENTORY REPORT] option
        ...PADE Transaction Report [PSJ PADE TRANSACTION REPORT] option
  
 3.  A new security key, PSJ PADE MGR, was created to allow access to the 
     above menus noted in item 2.
  
 4.  The option, PADE System Division Setup [PSJ PADE DIVISION SETUP],
     was exported as a separate option so that it can be given to an
     assigned user to set up a division under a PADE.
  
 5.  A new security key, PSJ PADE ADV, was created to allow access to the 
     above option noted in item 4.
  
 6.  The option, PADE Surgery Task [PSJ PADE SURGERY TASK], was exported as
     a standalone option so that sites can schedule it as a recurring task.
  
 7.  The option, PADE Appointment Task [PSJ PADE APPOINTMENT TASK], was
     exported as a standalone option so that sites can schedule it as a
     recurring task.
  
 8.  Two HL7 application parameters, PSJ VISTA and PSJ PADE SERVER, were
     created for site specific information.
  
 9.  One Logical Link, PSJ PADE, was created to support the Outbound HL7
     messages.
  
 10. The following protocols were created to receive and send outbound
     Admission, Discharge and Transfer (ADT) events:
     PSJ ADT-A01 ROUTER
     PSJ ADT-A01 SERVER - Admission event
     PSJ ADT-A01 CLIENT
     PSJ ADT-A02 SERVER - Transfer event
     PSJ ADT-A02 CLIENT
     PSJ ADT-A03 SERVER - Discharge event 
     PSJ ADT-A03 CLIENT
     PSJ ADT-A08 SERVER - Demographic changes
     PSJ ADT-A08 CLIENT
     PSJ ADT-A11 SERVER - Cancel Admission event
     PSJ ADT-A11 CLIENT
     PSJ ADT-A12 SERVER - Cancel Transfer event
     PSJ ADT-A12 CLIENT
     PSJ ADT-A13 SERVER - Cancel Discharge event
     PSJ ADT-A13 CLIENT
  
     PSJ ADT-A01 ROUTER is setup as a subscribing protocol to VAFC ADT-A01 
     SERVER, VAFC ADT-A02 SERVER, VAFC ADT-A03 SERVER, VAFC ADT-A08 SERVER,
     VAFC ADT-A08-TSP SERVER (bed switch), VAFC ADT-A11 SERVER, VAFC
     ADT-A12 SERVER, VAFC ADT-A13 SERVER.
  
     In the REGISTRATION V. 5.3 package, options like Admit a Patient [DG
     ADMIT PATIENT], Transfer a Patient [DG TRANSFER PATIENT], Discharge a
     Patient [DG DISCHARGE PATIENT], Switch Bed [DG BED SWITCH] etc., will
     trigger appropriate outbound HL7 messages.
     The routine tied to protocol PSJ ADT-A01 ROUTER that subscribes to 
     these events (VAFC ADT related protocol) will scan the HL7 message and
     will build a modified copy of the HL7  message including the Allergy
     (AL1) and the Observation/Result (OBX) segments. The generated HL7
     message will be sent to the respective PADE via the Vitria Interface
     Engine (VIE).
  
 11. The following protocols were created to receive and send outbound
     Clinic check-ins and appointments.
      PSJ SIU-SDAM ROUTER - subscribing protocol to VAFC ADT-A08-SDAM
      SERVER 
      PSJ SIU-S12 SERVER - event driver for clinic check-in 
      PSJ SIU-S12 CLIENT - subscriber 
  
     During patient check-in in the Scheduling V. 5.3 package, the 
     protocol, VAFC ADT-A08-SDAM SERVER builds a standard HL7 message.
     The routine tied to protocol PSJ SIU-SDAM ROUTER that subscribes
     to the VAFC ADT-A08-SDAM SERVER, will scan the HL7 message and will
     build a new copy of the HL7 message including the Allergy (AL1)
     and the Observation/Result (OBX) segments. The generated HL7 message
     will be sent to the respective PADE via the Vitria Interface Engine
     (VIE).
  
 12. The following protocols were created to send outbound order messages
     in the form of RDE-O11 HL7 messages to the appropriate PADE system.
     PSJ RDEO11 SERVER
     PSJ RDEO11 CLIENT
  
     In Inpatient Medications, when orders are verified, edited, renewed, 
     discontinued, reinstated, put on hold/removed from hold, and when 
     orders are discontinued in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
     V. 3.0, an outbound HL7 message will be sent to the respective PADE
     via the Vitria Interface Engine (VIE).
  
 13. The following protocols were created to receive and process inbound 
     PADE Activity (e.g., Dispense, Load, etc.) in the form of
     OMS-O05 HL7 messages:
     PSJ PADE OMS-O05 EVENT
     PSJ PADE OMS-O05 SUB
     PSJ PADE OMS-O05 EVENT 2.3
     PSJ PADE OMS-O05 SUB 2.3
  
     Backward compatible HL7 v2.3 protocols accept and parse current 
     industry standard Pocket Maintenance (ZPM) segments to facilitate
     transition to the new PADE standard.
  
     Inbound HL7 messages from the PADE vendor are validated and filed into
     the PADE INBOUND TRANSACTION file (#58.6), which triggers an 
     automatic update of the inventory information in the PADE INVENTORY
     SYSTEM file (#58.601).
  
  14. A new multiple, DWO MESSAGE ENTITY, has been added to the PADE
      INVENTORY SYSTEM file (#58.601) to contain mail groups that will
      receive Mailman messages when PADE drugs are Dispensed Without an
      Order (DWO). 
  
  15. A new multiple, CONFIG ERRORS MAIL GROUPS, has been added to the PADE
      INVENTORY SYSTEM file (#58.601) to receive error messages when 
      configuration problems are encountered with Inbound PADE HL7
      messages.
  
  16. A new multiple, DATA ERRORS MAIL GROUPS, has been added to the PADE 
      INVENTORY SYSTEM file (#58.601) to receive error messages when data 
      validation problems are encountered with Inbound PADE HL7 messages.
  
  17. Inpatient Pharmacy Order Entry screens have been modified to 
      display PADE inventory information, specifically:
  
      a. The Inpatient Pharmacy Order Entry order detail screens
         will contain a new "PADE" column when displaying Dispense Drugs,
         containing the PADE inventory availability for the displayed
         dispense drug. To make room for the PADE inventory information,
         the message field will continue displaying, but drug classes will
         no longer display as a FileMan identifier when a list of dispense
         drug choices are displayed.
  
      b. The Inpatient Pharmacy Order Entry Patient Profile screen
         includes a flag, (PD), indicating whether or not the order
         contains a drug that is a PADE stock item. If a drug is both a
         PADE item and a Ward Stock item, the ward stock flag (WS) is
         combined with the PADE flag (WP).
  
  18. A Kernel parameter, PSJ PADE OE BALANCES, has been created to allow
      each site to control whether or not PADE inventory information
      displays in the Inpatient Order Entry profile screens and drug
      lookups. A prompt to set the parameter has been added to the new PSJ
      PADE INVENTORY Input Template, accessible via the Inventory System
      Setup [PSJ PADE INVENTORY SYSTEM] option.
  
  19. The option, Pick List [PSJU PL], has been modified to include the 
      drug Internal Entry Number (IEN) field after the drug name and to
      include the word "PADE" if the medication listed is a PADE stock
      item.
  
  20. A new Protocol, PSJ LM PADE ACTIVITY, has been added to the PSJ LM 
      PROFILE HIDDEN ACTIONS Protocol to display a new hidden action (PD) 
      in the Inpatient Pharmacy patient profile screen. The new PD hidden
      action displays all of the PADE transactions for the patient being
      displayed.
  
  21. The Pre-Exchange DOSES prompt that displays after verifying an 
      Inpatient Unit Dose order has been modified to default the number of 
      doses to zero when the drug may be dispensed from PADE, and a message
      is displayed explaining the drug is a PADE item.
                                   
  22. This patch also provides a log file, PADE OUTBOUND MESSAGES 
      file (#58.72) of the outbound ADT, SIU and RDE HL7 messages to use 
      with FileMan for trouble shooting purposes only.
      Note: The nightly background job (PSGBRJ) has been modified to purge 
      records older than 30 days.
  
 Note: This patch also exports a post-install routine PSJ317P that will 
 setup PSJ ADT-A01 ROUTER as a subscribing protocol to VAFC ADT-A01 
 SERVER, VAFC ADT-A02 SERVER, VAFC ADT-A03 SERVER, VAFC ADT-A08 SERVER,
 VAFC ADT-A08-TSP SERVER, VAFC ADT-A11 SERVER, VAFC ADT-A12 SERVER and VAFC
 ADT-A13 SERVER protocols. It will also setup protocol PSJ SIU-SDAM ROUTER
 as a subscribing protocol to VAFC ADT-A08-SDAM SERVER protocol.
 The post-install also sets the following field to the PSJ PADE entry in 
 the HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870):
    a. AUTOSTART field (#4.5) is set to 1 (Enabled) so that the PSJ PADE 
       logical link will be started automatically when Cache or TaskMan is 
       restarted.
    b. DO NOT PING field (#24) is set to 1 (Yes) due to the unique aspects
       of the PADE interface. If PSJ PADE is sent an HLO PING CLIENT 
       message, an infinite loop will be created consisting of VIE sending
       VistA additional CR messages and VistA not responding. This 
       situation requires manual intervention by a member of the VIE
       National Admins team and therefore needs to be avoided.
  
 This post-install routine will be deleted from your system upon completion
 of the patch installation.
