Subject: ERROR PURGING FILE 53.4 / WARD TRANSFER ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1) <UNDEFINED> error when purging PRE-EXCHANGE NEEDS file.
 2) Ward field set to zero in Patient Pharmacy file for IV orders.    
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1)  CA-SDM- I18121489FY18  
 2)  CA-SDM- I18238135FY18 
  
  
 1) <UNDEFINED> error when purging PRE-EXCHANGE NEEDS file.
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 The reporting site is encountering occasional <UNDEFINED> errors in their
 error trap with errors displayed as <UNDEFINED>NXEC+4^DIK1. The 
 PURGE^PSGPER1 process submits a task to the Task Manager to remove a
 record from the PRE-EXCHANGE NEEDS file (#53.4) but is causing an error
 when the instance being submitted to be deleted no longer exists.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Modified TASKPRGE^PSGPER1 to utilize the scratch global ^XTMP to track
 when an index (ien) for the file 53.4 (PRE-EXCHANGE NEEDS) is tasked to be
 purged by the Task Manager. The ^XTMP global will be checked to see if an
 index has already been tasked to purge. If the index has already been
 tasked to purge then the submission of another task will be bypassed. If
 it has not been tasked to purge then the purge will be tasked and an entry
 to the ^XTMP global will be created. The ^XTMP entry will then be removed
 after file 53.4 has been purged.
  
 New ^XTMP format:
  
 ^XTMP("PSGPER1:index*",0)=purge date ^date created^"File 53.4 purge log"
 * index = ien of file 53.4
  
  
 2) Ward field set to zero in Patient Pharmacy file for IV orders.  
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 An issue was identified in Pharmacy that is causing inaccurate results in 
 DSS.  When an Inpatient with IV orders has been discharged and a ward 
 transfer is entered AFTER the discharge, backdating the transfer, the IV 
 orders will no longer show a ward designation in the Pharmacy Patient 
 File (55). This issue is happening only with IV orders.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routine PSJADT1 to ensure the ward is not set 
 to null for the IV orders.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 No options need to be disabled.  It is best to install this patch during
 non-peak hours.  
  
 This patch should take less than 2 minutes to install.
  
  
 1.     Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.     Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3.     From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
        the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
        following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the
        patch #PSJ*5.0*359:
  
   a.   Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
   b.   Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        (allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed.  It compares all components of this patch routines, 
        DDs,templates, etc.).
  
   c.   Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you 
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
  
 4.     From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option 
        and choose the patch to install.
  
 5.     When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
        NO//', respond NO
  
 6.     When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? NO//', respond NO
  
 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
 ;;5.0;INPATIENT MEDICATIONS;**[PATCH LIST]**;[DATE];[BUILD NUMBER]
    
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run 
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
   
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of 
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSJ*5.0*359 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSJ*5.0*359 in
 the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;5.0;INPATIENT MEDICATIONS;**[Patch List]**;16 DEC 97;Build 7
