 1)     Admin History report has wrong data (New option AH)

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1)  CA-SDM I12284711FY17       
  
 Admin History report has wrong data (New option AH)
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 The new AH Report, Administration History for Orderable Item, is pulling in
 erroneous data.
  
 A patient had a Unit Dose and an IV order for the same orderable item during
 the given time frame.  This report was designed for Unit Dose orders only.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routine PSGAH to exclude IV orders.
  
  
 2)  CA-SDM I12778660FY17       
  
 Hard error when deleting AUTH ABS transfer with an IV order
  
 Problem: 
 ========
  
 An Inpatient patient, with an active IV order, was transferred to AUTH ABS
 (authorized absence < 96 hours).  The transfer was deleted and the user
 received a hard error in VistA.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
  
 A modification was made to routine PSJADT1 to ensure that the variable VAIP(5)
 has a valid value prior to calling PSJADT0.
  
 3)  CA-SDM I13047648FY17       
  
 Scheduled IV labels sometimes do not print.
  
 Problem:
 ========
 A site had run their Ward List for piggyback coverage from 0501 - 0500.  
 There was a patient who had an IV order of one-time with a start 
 date/time that was the same as the stop date/time for the ward list, 0500.  
 When the report was run it showed the patient but showed zero for labels
 needed.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routine PSIVWL to correct the evaluation so 
 that if the start time of the order is exactly the same as the stop 
 time of the manufacturing stop time for the coverage, the label will print.
  
 4)  CA-SDM R16812937FY18
  
 Scheduled IV labels are printing past the WL stop date/time
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Some sites are seeing more labels being printed than there should be. 
 Labels are printing out past the stop date/time of the submitted Ward List.
 This issue surfaced after the release of PSJ*5*341.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to PSIVWL to ensure that labels are printed
 for the time frame of the Ward List
