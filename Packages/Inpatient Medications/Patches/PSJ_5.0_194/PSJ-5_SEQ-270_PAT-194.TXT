Subject: SCHEDULE WORD LIMIT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

  
 This patch is part of a multi-package build. Currently, the Inpatient 
 Pharmacy and Outpatient Pharmacy software allows a maximum of three words 
 when creating a schedule. This can prevent a medication from being ordered
 with the intended schedule. If the administration schedule in the
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) has a name such as EVERY OTHER DAY
 and the provider subsequently checks the PRN box in CPRS, the schedule's
 full name now becomes EVERY OTHER DAY PRN.  The Inpatient Order Entry
 option [PSJ OE] will not allow this schedule to process because it now
 contains four words.  The patch will modify the space limit for the
 schedule to allow PRN, but will keep the validation as it was before.
  
  
 Patch PSJ*5.0*194 Addresses two issues:
  
 1) Pharmacy schedules containing more than 3 words are not allowed in
 order processing.  This has caused some schedules such as EVERY OTHER DAY
 PRN to be rejected when processed in Outpatient Pharmacy Patient
 Prescription Processing option [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS].
  
 2) When the schedule "EVERY OTHER DAY" was ordered for the laboratory 
 package, the software calculated the test to be performed every day.
  
 ***PSS*1*119 can be installed independently of the PSO*7*282/PSJ*5*194 
 combined patch build, however the functionality will not be effective 
 until both are installed.

 Remedy Ticket(s) Overview:
 ==========================  
 1)      INC000000175199 - Error missing or invalid schedule
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Currently, the Inpatient Pharmacy software allows a schedule name to have 
 a maximum of three words.  If a three-word schedule name is used in CPRS 
 and the PRN box is checked, it becomes a four-word schedule name.  
 Inpatient Order Entry rejects the schedule and the order cannot be 
 processed with the intended schedule.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Routines PSGORS0, PSIVEDT1, PSJDDUT and PSJHL9 have had a condition 
 added where a schedule can have more than three words if it contains 
 "PRN".  If not it still performs the normal validation. The Data 
 Dictionary for file 55.01, field .09 was updated to allow 3 or more word 
 schedules with the PRN option chosen.
  
  
 2)      INC000000070913 - QOD schedule not working correctly.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the schedule "EVERY OTHER DAY" was ordered for the laboratory 
 package, the software calculated the test to be performed every day.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The SCHEDULE VALIDATION routine PSJSV was modified for the LAB SERVICE
 (LR) package to look at the Frequency in Minutes value of the schedule
 before it sets the orders.  The Frequency in Minutes value of the schedule
 was previously not being used correctly for Lab orders to calculate the
 test frequency.
  
 It should be noted that although this is a modification to Inpatient 
 Pharmacy software, LAB SERVICES uses the order schedule frequency
 processor portion of this SCHEDULE VALIDATION program to evaluate and
 calculate order schedules.  Therefore this fix will go out under the
 Inpatient Pharmacy namespace.  No Inpatient Pharmacy functions are
 impacted by the fix.

 Software Retrieval:
 ===================
 Patches for this installation are combined in host file 
 PSJ_194_PSO_282.KID.
  
 Installation of this host file should be coordinated among the packages 
 affected since only one installation is necessary.
  
 The patches are:
  
      PSJ*5.0*194
      PSO*7.0*282
  
 Sites may retrieve the KIDS build in one of the following ways:
  
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 download.vista.domain.ext
 which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
  
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve the patch directly from a specific
 server as follows:
  
   OIFO               FTP ADDRESS                  DIRECTORY
   --------------     ------------------------     ------------------
   Albany             ftp.domain.ext     
   Hines              ftp.domain.ext      
   Salt Lake City     ftp.domain.ext        
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 The patch will be released in conjunction with an Outpatient Pharmacy
 patch, PSO*7*282.
  
   ************************ NOTE ************************
   IF A USER IS ON THE SYSTEM AND USING THESE PROGRAMS 
   AN EDITED ERROR WILL OCCUR.  
   The patch should be installed when NO Inpatient Pharmacy 
   or Outpatient Pharmacy users are on the system.
   ******************************************************
  
  Installation will take less than 1 minute.
  
  Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
  
   1. Obtain the file PSJ_194_PSO_282.KID.
     
   2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
   3. Use Load a Distribution using PSJ_194_PSO_282.KID when
      prompted to Enter a Host File name.  You may need to append a
      directory name.
   
   4. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSJ*5.0*194):
          a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
              you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
              transport global.
          b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
              the components of the KIDS build.
          c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
              allow you to view all changes that will be made when 
              this patch is installed.  It compares all components of 
              this patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
          d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
              message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
              backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
    
   7. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//",
      respond NO.
    
   8. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? NO//", respond NO.
