 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1. INC5391470 - IV Order entered under wrong patient name
  
  
 Problem:
 -------
 An IV order was placed for the wrong patient. The site discovered this 
 and attempted to delete the order using the Delete Orders (IV) [PSJI 
 DELETE ORDER] option . The option would not delete the order because a
 label had been printed for it. In addition, the documentation for the
 option in the Inpatient Medications Supervisor's User Manual says the
 option is temporarily unavailable. However, the site was able to use the
 option.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Changed routine PSJHL2 so the Delete Orders (IV) [PSJI DELETE ORDER] 
 option has been placed out of order due to the absence of functionality 
 to detect BCMA actions on an order to be deleted.  Sites should mark 
 affected orders as Discontinued in situations where the Delete Orders 
 (IV) [PSJI DELETE ORDER] option would previously have been used.
  
 2. INC2263383 - Nature of order mismatch between pharmacy package and
                 CPRS for IV order
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When using the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option, the wrong "Nature 
 of Order" value can be stored in the ORDER file [#100] for IV orders when 
 a unit dose order is processed immediately before it.  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Changed routine PSJHL2 so there are additional checks to the Nature of 
 Order assignment in order to properly assign the correct Nature of Order 
 value for an IV order that is processed after a unit dose order.

 containing the backed-up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" 
 function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function 
 "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed-up routines 
 onto the VistA System.
