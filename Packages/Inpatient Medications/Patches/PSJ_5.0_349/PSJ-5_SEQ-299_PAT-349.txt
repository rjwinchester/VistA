Subject: CROC GLOBAL & NEXT DOSE DUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1) There is an issue where the drug name is being stored for an intervention
    for Clinical Reminder and not the drug IEN.
 2) "Next Dose Due:" is displaying incorrectly when changing START DATE/TIME 
    to NOW on an active order.

 1.  CA-SDM I11127755FY17  Rational 583634   
  
 IV Order Clinical Reminder Order Check Intervention Storing Bad Global Data for
 Drug 
  
 Problem:
 -------
 An Inpatient with an active inpatient unit dose order had a new IV order
 entered, which triggered the Clinical Reminder Order Check against the 
 active  order. An intervention was entered into the APSP Intervention 
 file (9009032.4), but was stored with the IV print name as opposed to the
 drug IEN.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 A modification was made to routine PSJCROC to ensure that the TMP global is
 being populated with the drug IEN and not the IV Print Name.
  
  
 2.  CA-SDM R12170420FY17  Rational 588136   
  
 Medication Order Schedule
  
 Problem:
 -------
 An Active Inpatient Med order with a Schedule of greater than 24 hours, 
 e.g. Q72H, was modified by changing the START DATE/TIME on the order to
 NOW. While finishing the order the "Next Dose Due:" is displaying the  
 incorrect date/time.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Added code to routine PSJUTL so that during the edit process the correct "Next
 Dose Due:" date and time is correctly displayed.
