 Overview:
 =========
 1. INC000000775082 - One time order appears as active after discharge
   
    Problem: 
    ========
    An inpatient was ordered a one-time dose of an Intravenous Piggy Back
    (IVPB) Antibiotic. The order was finished by a pharmacist in the 
    Intravenous (IV) package and the nurse marked it as given in Bar Code 
    Medication Administration (BCMA). Before the nurse could give the
    medication the patient was discharged and transferred to another
    hospital.
  
    After the patient was discharged the floor nurse went into BCMA and
    marked the medication as NOT GIVEN. This resulted in the inpatient
    medication being reinstated and showing as active in the patients
    Inpatient Medication Profile even though he was discharged. The order
    no longer displayed in BCMA.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Modifications were made to the PSJBCMA4 routine to check to see if the
    patient is still an inpatient patient.
  
  
 2. INC000000849604 - Option PSJ EXP gets an error with clinic orders
   
    Problem: 
    ========
    Inpatient Stop Order Notices option [PSJ EXP] generates a subscript
    error when attempting to use it to search for orders in a specific
    Clinic or Clinic Group.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Modifications were made to routines PSJEXP & PSJEXP0 to handle the
    presence of Clinic Orders.
  
  
 3. I5683562FY15 - Mismatch Dosage Warning inconsistent
   
    Problem: 
    ========
    An order was entered for a drug with dosage of 850MG. While finishing
    the order, the dosage was modified to 3400mg. The user received the
    appropriate dosage warning message and proceeded to update the Dispense
    Drug for the correct U/D (unit dose). When the user went to verify the
    order they still received the dosage warning message.
  
    The problem was when the dosage was modified the unit of measure was
    entered in lower case. This caused the process to display the message
    again.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    A modification was made to routine PSJDOSE to make sure the unit of
    measure for the dosage is converted to upper case.
