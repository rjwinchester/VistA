Subject: ERROR WHEN COPYING ORDERS/COMPLEX ORDERS UNLOCKING ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses three (3) issues:
  
 1) Users are encountering an <UNDEFINED> error when an active order is
 copied and one of the order's fields is modified and the new order is made
 active. The error is displayed as follows: <UNDEFINED>ENSFE3+2^PSGOEE0
 *PSGOEEF
  
 2) User reported that when using the VistA option for Inpatient Order
 Entry, and after verifying all of the child orders that are part of a
 complex order for an inpatient, the orders remain locked in CPRS until
 the user exits the option instead of unlocking the order immediately upon
 the verification of all the child orders in the complex order.
  
 3) Users are receiving the message "This order is being edited by another 
 terminal" when a user in a different session has already completed 
 editing.

 3)INC0949944   - Complex orders unlocking issue  
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 1)R18516607FY18- Error copying new order 
  
 Users are encountering an <UNDEFINED> error when an active order is copied
 and one of the order's fields is modified and the new order is made 
 active. The error is displayed as follows:  <UNDEFINED>ENSFE3+2^PSGOEE0
 *PSGOEEF 
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Modified routine PSGOD to initialize the counter variable PSGOEEF to zero
 (0) prior to the call of routine PSGOEE0.
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 2)R18586253FY18- Complex orders unlocking issue
  
 User reported that when using the VistA option for Inpatient Order Entry, 
 and after verifying all of the child orders that are part of a complex 
 order for an inpatient, the orders remain locked in CPRS until the user
 exits the option instead of unlocking the order immediately after the
 verification of all the child orders in the complex order.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Made a modification to the PSJOEA2 routine to write to the TMP scratch 
 global to track when all child orders of a complex order are verified.
 PSJOEA routine was modified to execute the PSSLOCK routine to unlock the 
 child orders immediately after all of the child orders being verified.
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 3)INC0949944- Complex orders unlocking issue
  
 User when using the VistA option for Inpatient Order Entry are receiving
 the message "This order is being edited by another terminal" when another
 user in a different session is at the Select PATIENT prompt after 
 finishing and accepting all components of an IV complex order.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Added the call L -^PS(53.1,PSJO)  to the SELECT tag in the PSJOEA routine 
 in the same block as other unlocking calls.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------- 
 It should take less than 2 minutes to install this patch.
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
    2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select the
       Installation menu.  From this menu, you may select to use the
       following options: 
       when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the patch # PSJ*5.0*367:
  
         a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of this patch 
            routines, DDs, templates, etc.
  
         c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
            you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
            transport global.
  
    4. From the Installation menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
       choose the patch to install.
  
    5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', respond NO.
  
    6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
    7. If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
 5.0;INPATIENT MEDICATIONS;**[PATCH LIST]**;DECEMBER 1997
    
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run 
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
   
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of 
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the PSJ Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSJ*5.0*367 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSJ*5.0*367 in
 the patch list section on line 2.
