Subject: CLINIC LABEL/IV ORDER ISSUE/METRIC CONVERSION/INFUSION RATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues:
 1) Label for Clinic infusion for Inpatient is printing the ward and 
    not the clinic name.
 2) Metric Conversion for Patients Weight consistency
 3) Leading zero dropped between CPRS and VistA for IV solution
 4) Appending to infusion rate incorrectly

 1) I9857169FY16 - Label for Clinic infusion for Inpatient is printing the
                ward and not the clinic name (formerly remedy 1303613)
    R10344535FY16(d) Label for clinic order prints ward location and not

                it crosses over from CPRS to Inpatient Medications

 Patient Safety Issue:

 PSPO 3299
  
 1) I9857169FY16 - Label for Clinic infusion for Inpatient is printing the
                ward and not the clinic name
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The label for a Clinic Infusion order for an Inpatient patient is showing
 the ward location and not the clinic location.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Modified two routines, PSIVLABL and PSIVLABR to remove the plus (+) from
 the line of code that pulls in the clinic information.  This will ensure
 that both the clinic id and the date/time is pulled from the Pharmacy
 Patient File (#55).
  
  
 2) I5600103FY15 - Make Metric Conversions for Patient Weight consistent
                across VistA Packages
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 The conversion from lbs to kgs is being changed from 2.2 lbs/kg to 2.2046226
 lbs/kg to make BCMA consistent with CPRS. Other pharmacy packages needed
 to make this change as well.  Inpatient Medications is one of these packages 
 where this conversion needs to be updated. 
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to two routines, PSJAC and PSJLMHED to expand the
 metric conversion from 2.2 to 2.2046226.
  
  
 3) R8636432FY16 - The leading zero on IV Solution volume is dropped when
                it crosses over from CPRS to IV Medications
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 When an IV order is entered in CPRS, where the volume of the solution has a
 leading zero, such as 0.9mg, when the order comes over to Vista, the 
 leading zero is dropped.  
  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routine PSJHL4A to not plus the volume, which 
 strips the leading zero(s) when moving this value to another variable 
 for subsequent processing in VistA.
  
 4) I9785109FY16 - Free text Infusion rate is being appended incorrectly
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 A free text infusion rate for a continuous IV order that is entered in Vista,
 is having the ml/hr appended to the infusion rate incorrectly. 
   
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routine PSIVSP to check the infusion rate to 
 see if it needs the rate appended to the dosage.
