 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) Overview:
 ==========================================
  
 1. I8133531FY16 - Pending renewal shows dose of original order
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  An IV pending renewal shows the dosage of the original order that it was
  changed from.
  
  An Inpatient Medication was ordered for a patient in CPRS. In VistA, with
  auto-verify turned ON, the medication was Finished (FN) as an IV order 
  and the dosage was modified, for example from 2MG to 4MG, during the
  process. After the order was Accepted (AC) and renewed, the dosage 
  showed as being reverted back to the original ordered dosage.
  
  Inpatient Medication (unit dose) orders entered in CPRS, will have the
  NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1), populated with the dosage ordered as a
  unit dose. In contrast, when an IV Fluid order is placed in CPRS, this
  field is not populated.
  
  When the Inpatient Medication order is finished as an IV fluid order in 
  VistA, the system is pulling the dosage ordered from the NON-VERIFIED
  ORDERS file (#53.1) with the assumption that it is being finished as a
  Unit Dose order.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  A modification was made to SET55^PSIVORFB to ensure that the PHARMACY
  PATIENT file (#55), UNIT DOSE multiple (#62), DISPENSE DRUG multiple 
 (#2), UNITS PER DOSE sub-field (#.02) is not populated with the
  dosage ordered.
  
 For these types of IV orders, a value was getting populated in the UD 
 field of the Pharmacy Patient File when it should not have been there to 
 begin (it was finished as an IV order).  This is what was causing the 
 display to be wrong in the first place.   This happens when an Inpatient 
 Medication is prescribed but finished as an IV order.
  
 2. I10569721FY16 - Clinic Order cross-references not being set correctly
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  When the user selects option Clinic Definition [PSJ CD] in VistA, and
  changes the IMO DC/EXPIRED DAY LIMIT for a particular Clinic, to a
  different value over 30 days, the IMO clinic cross-references are not
  being set correctly.
  
  An inpatient's clinic order, which is over 30 days old (but not over 120
  days), is not being included in the order checks when processing new
  orders. The routine that handles the updating of the clinic
  cross-references is not passing the new IMO DC/EXPIRED DAY LIMIT value
  resulting in a default of 30 days.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  A modification was made to IMOSET^PSJIMO1 to include the Clinic internal
  entry number. This is needed so that the IMO DC/EXPIRED DAY LIMIT can be
  pulled from the CLINIC DEFINITION (#53.46) file, to ensure the correct
  day limit is being used when setting the clinic cross-reference.
  
 3. I11954826FY17 - Major latency when running PSJ EXP on Clinics
  
  Problem: 
  --------
  The Inpatient Stop Order Notices [PSJ EXP] report, when run for Clinics,
  is taking an exceptionally long time to run. The user enters a stop date
  for the report but when the report is run the stop date is not getting
  passed on to the variable. The variable used to walk the Clinic
  cross-references of AIVC (IV orders) and AUDC (unit dose orders)
  currently is being set to zero, which results in walking the entire
  cross-reference.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  A modification was made to routine PSJEXP in tag LC to set the variable
  STDTE to the user's inputted date and not start with a date of zero.
  
 4. I15062740FY17 - PADE transaction reports won't find CS drug 
                    transactions that are unmatched to the NDF
  
  
  Problem: 
  ========
  The option, PSJ PADE TRANSACTION REPORT, will not list the Controlled  
  Substances (CS) transactions in the report if the drug is not matched 
  to NDF.
  Also, during testing, we noticed that if the schedule "2n"s and "3n"s
  are selected independently, those transactions will not be listed in the
  report.
  
  Resolution:
  ===========
  The extrinsic function $$GETCLASS in routine PSJPDRIN was modified to 
  return the CS FEDERAL SCHEDULE field (#19) from the VA PRODUCT FILE
  (#50.68) or the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) of the DRUG file (#50)
  depending on whether the drug is matched to NDF or not. The schedule
  "2C"s and "3C"s from the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field (#3) will be converted
  to "2n"s and "3n"s.
