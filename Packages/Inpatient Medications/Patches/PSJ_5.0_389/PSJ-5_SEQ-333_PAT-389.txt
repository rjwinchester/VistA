Subject: ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE LOOKUP ISSUE/INCORRECT PATIENT CLASS FOR PADE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following issues.
  
 1. INC5265212 - Hard error when performing schedule lookup
 2. INC5174261 - Incorrect patient class in PADE HL7 message 
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC5265212 - Hard error when performing schedule lookup
  
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 A hard error generated while displaying of the ADMINISTRATION 
 SCHEDULE file (#51.1) entries while editing the ListMan when
 trying to edit the "Schedule:" field #8 during finishing an order using 
 the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option. This is happening only if the
 patient is an outpatient (not admitted).
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch fixes the hard error generated when performing a lookup on the 
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) in case of outpatient.
  
  
 2. INC5174261 - Incorrect patient class in PADE HL7 message 
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 The Patient Class code for clinical appointments that is being transmitted
 to PADE devices via HL7 messaging is incorrectly being sent to indicate
 that a patient is an outpatient when, in fact, the patient is an 
 inpatient.
   
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Added an indicator to the process that creates the HL7 message for PADE
 for reporting clinical appointments that will be utilized to properly 
 identify the patient as an inpatient and set the Patient Class code in
 the PV1 segment of the HL7 message to represent that the patient is an 
 inpatient. 
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Wichita VAMC
 Connecticut HCS

 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 3 minutes
 to install.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu. From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch
     (ex. PSJ*5*389):
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  Select the installation option Backup a Transport Global. This 
     option will create a backup message of any routines exported with 
     this patch in case you need to back-out this patch. It will not backup
     any other changes such as Data Dictionaries (DD's) or templates. It 
     is important this step be followed, because if back-out of this patch 
     is necessary, having the backup will make the process much easier.
  
 5.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//', answer 'NO'.  
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//', answer 'NO'
  
 8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//', answer 'NO'.
  
 9.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//', respond 0.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
  ;;5.0;INPATIENT MEDICATIONS;**[PATCH LIST]**;16 DEC 97
  
 The Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] option can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
