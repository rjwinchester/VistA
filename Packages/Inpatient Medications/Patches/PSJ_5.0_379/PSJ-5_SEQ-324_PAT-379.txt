Subject: PADE ROOM-BED/WARD ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses a PADE ROOM-BED/WARD issue.
  
 Patient Safety Issues (HITPS):
 -----------------------------
 None
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 INC2336651  PADE BED-ROOM configuration glitch
    
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 There is an issue when different wards are configured by ROOM-BED, using 
 the exact same ROOM-BED designations, that the wrong dispensing machine 
 in a different ward could receive the meds for that patient.
  
 A patient admitted to WARD B could have his medications delivered 
 to WARD A. 
  
 The system was not designed to handle this type of occurrence, where there are
 duplicated ROOM-BED designations.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
  
 A modification was made to routine PSJPDCL to ensure that the correct WARD is 
 identified for the patient.
  
  
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 Tennessee Valley VAMC
 Upstate New York HCS

 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of the 
 development team, the support team and appropriate VA site/region 
 personnel. The decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint 
 decision between these groups.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from this patch description.
