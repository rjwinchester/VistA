 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1)      INC000000827649        Undefined errors on reprint of IV labels.
  
  
   Problem:
   -----------
   Menu option PSJI MGR, Label Menu, Individual Labels (IV) is used to 
   reprint a label for a patient with x number of IV Orders.  When the user
   goes to enter a new  order using menu option Order Entry (IV) for a 
   second patient that has fewer IV orders in the Pharmacy Patient file 
   (#55) than the previous patient and this second patient has a drug class
   allergy to the medication being ordered, the Undefined error will occur.
  
  
   Resolution:
   --------------
   A modification was made in the EXIT ACTION of Option PSJI LBLI.  This 
   will clean up any leftover variables after executing the Individual 
   Labels (IV) menu option.
  
  
 2)     INC000001260009:        Remote allergy entries, nor the titles,
                                are being displayed when there are no local
                                allergy entries or no known allergies (NKA).
  
   Patient Safety Issue:
   --------------------
   PSPO 2881
  
                    
  
   Problem:
   -----------
   When a patient has no known local allergies (NKA) or no allergy 
   assessment, the remote allergy information does not display on the 
   Inpatient Patient Information screen. 
  
   Resolution:
   --------------
   Modify routine PSJLMUTL to ensure that the Remote Allergy information 
   and/or headers are always displayed on the Inpatient Patient Information
   Screen. 
  
  
 3)     INC000001240752:        BCBU patient shows duplicate order with an
                                order reference of "UU" on the BCBU Mar report.
  
   Patient Safety Issue:
   --------------------
   PSPO 2852
  
  
   Problem:
   --------
   After renewing a discontinued Unit Dose order, due to patient movement,
   duplicate orders were found on the BCBU MAR report.
  
   Resolution:
   ------------
   A modification was made to routine PSGOERI that will prevent the duplicate
   orders from being created.   A post-install routine is included in this
   patch to identify any affected orders.
  
  
   ** Please be sure to see the POST-INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS section for 
   instructions on how to discontinue and re-enter these orders.

 POST INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
 -------------------------------------------
 This patch contains a post-install routine that will IDENTIFY any active
 orders that contain "UU" in NODE 4 of the ORDER File (#100). 
  
 A mailman message will be sent to the installer which will contain any 
 active orders containing the "UU", if any exist.
  
 The installer should look for this message in MailMan:
 'Background job for PSJ*5*320 Post Install'.
  
 If the message states 'NO AFFECTED ORDERS FOUND', installation of the 
 patch is complete and there is no more action required.
  
 If the message contains patient DFNs, the message should be forwarded to 
 the Pharmacy ADPAC so that the orders can be discontinued and re-entered.
  
 If your site is using BCBU then the following steps would need to be 
 taken:
 1)     Using Fileman, delete the patient from BCBU workstation. (file 
 #53.7)
 2)     Using menu option [PSB BCBU INIT SINGLE PT], re-initialize the BCBU
         patient.
  
 If you have any questions on this process, please log a CA SDM ticket.
