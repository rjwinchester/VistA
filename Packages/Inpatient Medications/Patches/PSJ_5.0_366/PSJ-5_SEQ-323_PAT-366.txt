 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 Item 1-3
 -------- 
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The prompt for selection of the medication route when entering an 
 inpatient medication (infusion/unit dose) order has been modified to list
 only those routes associated with the dosage form for the selected
 medication (short list).
 The system will allow partial matches that are found in the short list
 or an exact full-text match or an abbreviation match if found in the
 MEDICATION ROUTES file (#51.2).
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
  
 Routines PSGOE4, PSGOE8, PSGOE9 and PSIVEDT were modified to provide the
 following:
 1. If a default med route is not defined in the orderable item, med route 
    will be set to null (will not default to PO or ORAL).
 2. A "?" at the ROUTE prompt, will display a short list of routes that
    were defined in the orderable item, and the prompt for the short list
    selection will be "Select MED ROUTE: ".
 3. Partial match will pick a med route only if found in the short
    list (not from the long list).
 4. An exact match of the full route name or an abbreviated route name will
    also pick a med route.
 5. Existing functionality supporting "??" is retained. Entering "??" at 
    the ROUTE prompt will display all routes that have been defined for all
    orderable item. When typing in a route, if no match is found, then 
    "??" is displayed.
  
 Item 4
 ------ 
 Problem:
 -------
 The prompt for selecting a provider when finishing an inpatient medication
 (infusion/unit dose) order has been modified to list only those providers 
 who are active in VistA so that critical alerts/notifications related to
 orders will be processed in a timely manner.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routines PSGOE1, PSJOE0, PSGOE42, PSGOE82, PSGOE92, PSGOEEW, PSIVEDT, 
 PSJLMGUD, PSJOE0 and PSIVCHK were modified to perform additional checks
 for a provider to write medications by calling a new extrinsic function
 $$ACTPRO^PSGOE1(provider IEN).
  
 A provider is authorized to write medication if all the following fields
 in the New Person file (#200) are found to be true.
  
 a. Holds the Provider Key 
    200,8932.001  PROVIDER KEY
  
 b. Authorized to write set to "Yes"
    200,53.1      AUTHORIZED TO WRITE MED ORDERS PS;1 SET
  
 c. Inactivation date  (if exists is not < today's date)
    200,53.4      INACTIVE DATE          PS;4 DATE
  
 d. Termination date  (if exists is not < today's date) (new)
    200,9.2       TERMINATION DATE       0;11 DATE (audited)
  
 e. Not flagged as dis-user (new)
    200,7         DISUSER                0;7 SET
  
 This new extrinsic function $$ACTPRO^PSGOE1(provider IEN) will return a 
 one (1) when all of the above conditions are met otherwise, a zero (0) is
 returned.
  
  
 Item 5
 ------ 
 Problem:
 --------
  
 INC2806789 - Issues with patch PSJ 5 373 (HITPS-6415) - please remove the
              patch to fix the Start Date Time field
 INC2588377 - Unable to Edit Start Date/Time in Inpatient Order Entry
 (Duplicate) 
 INC2775053 - VistA troubleshoot (HITPS-6415) - related ticket from another
              region
 (Duplicate) 
 INC2099246 - HD UD Start/Date Updating Incorrectly
 (Duplicate) 
 INC2776369 - VistA troubleshoot - related ticket from another region
 (Duplicate) 
 INC3432487 - Start Date unable to be changed after schedule changed
 (Duplicate)
  
  
 After PSJ*5*373 was released some sites noticed that after editing the 
 Start Date/Time field for an Inpatient order via Inpatient Order Entry
 [PSJ OE] option it would not accept the user entry. Instead it would
 re-calculate the Start Date/Time. This happened when the Schedule and the
 Start Date/Time fields were edited simultaneously. This issue was 
 introduced by PSJ*5*373 as a negative side-effect of a fix for the ticket
 #I13108353FY17 (See PSJ*5*373 patch description for more details on the
 issue fixed).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A change was made to the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option to prevent 
 a re-calculation of the Start Date/Time when the field is manually being
 edited by the user.
    
 The routines PSGOE3, PSGOE41, PSGOE81 and PSGOE91 were changed at line tag
 A10+1 to set the variable PSGSDEDT to 1 (one) indicating the user is
 manually editing the Start Date/Time field. Then, the routine PSGOEE was
 modified at CHKDT+1 to verify whether the variable PSGSDEDT is set to 1, 
 if so it will quit and will no longer re-calculate the Start Date/Time.

 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes
 to install.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch 
     PSJ*5*366.
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  Select the installation option Backup a Transport Global. This 
     option will create a backup message of any routines exported with 
     this patch in case you need to back-out this patch. It will not backup
     any other changes such as Data Dictionaries (DD's) or templates. It 
     is important this step be followed, because if back-out of this patch 
     is necessary, having the backup will make the process much easier.
  
 5.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//', answer 'NO'.  
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//', answer 'NO'
  
 8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//', answer 'NO'.
  
 9.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//', respond 0.
  
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
  ;;5.0;INPATIENT MEDICATIONS;**[PATCH LIST]**;16 DEC 97;[BUILD #] 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out Procedures are only needed if there are major problems (examples 
 include the KIDS notice of incompletion or hard errors) resulting from the
 installation of this patch. You must have concurrence from Health Product
 Support before a rollback can occur. Enter a ServiceNow helpdesk ticket 
 to obtain this concurrence.
  
 Prior to installing a patch, the site/region should have saved a backup of
 the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport Global [XPD
 BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install). The message
 containing the backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan"
 function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK
 MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA
 System.
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSJ, PSG or PSI Routines contained in this patch using the option
 First Line Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines
 contained in the PSJ*5.0*366 patch have been rolled back, the first two
 lines of the Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch
 PSJ*5.0*366 in the patch list section on line 2.
