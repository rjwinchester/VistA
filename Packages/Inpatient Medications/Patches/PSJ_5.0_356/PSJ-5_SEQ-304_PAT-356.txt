 Problem:

 When processing transactions from a PADE system, the user received
 a FRAMESTACK error due to the Dispensing Device being named the same
 as a Ward Group on another Dispensing Device.
  
 Resolution:

 Modify the system so the Dispensing Device files correctly if it
 does not already exist in the PADE DISPENSING DEVICE file (#58.63).
  
 Modify routines PSJPADIT, PSJPADIU (new routine), PSJPAD70, PSJPAD7I
 to fix FileMan calls.

         b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
