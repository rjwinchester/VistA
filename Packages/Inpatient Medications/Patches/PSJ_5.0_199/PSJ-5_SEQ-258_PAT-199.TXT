Subject: Unusual Volume Rpt/Frequency Issue

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following 2 issues in the Inpatient 
 Medications package:
   
 1. When multiple IV orders are cancelled, returned or destroyed in Inpatient
    Medications, this information is not getting transmitted to the Decision
    Support System (DSS). DSS runs The Unusual Volume Report and without this
    information from Inpatient Medications, their report would be incorrect.
  
 2. When the Pharmacist is finishing two or more PRN unit dose orders back to
    back for a patient, the frequency of the first order is copied to the
    subsequent order's frequency for any subsequent orders marked as PRN "as
    needed".

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1. INC000000130922
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When multiple IV orders are cancelled, returned or destroyed in Inpatient
    Medications, this information is not getting transmitted to the Decision
    Support System (DSS). DSS runs The Unusual Volume Report and without this
    information from Inpatient Medications, their report would be incorrect.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch corrected Routine PSIVSTAT to send information to the DSS
    application every time a label is generated, returned, or destroyed.
  
  
 2. INC000000278356
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When the Pharmacist is finishing two or more PRN unit dose orders back to
    back for a patient, the frequency of the first order is copied to the
    subsequent order's frequency for any subsequent orders marked as PRN "as
    needed".   
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch modified Routine PSGOEF to ensure that the frequency information
    is cleared out prior to working on the next order.
