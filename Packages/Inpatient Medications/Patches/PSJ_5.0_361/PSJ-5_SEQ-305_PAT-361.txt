 1)  CA-SDM I18645262FY18       
  
 Special Instructions on edited order not copying correctly
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 An edit was made to an active Unit Dose order (starred field) which results
 in a new order to be created, then the Special Instructions were modified
 for the new order prior to Accepting.  When the order is accepted, the
 new Special Instructions are not only stored in the new order, but also
 overrides the original order with no activity log to show the change in
 the original order.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routine PSJBCMA5 to check to see if a new
 order is being created.  If so, do not update the original order 
 with the new orders Special Instructions.
  
 2)  CA-SDM  I18849802FY18
      Duplicate: I19464956FY18
  
 Next Dose Due is not displaying correctly 
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When an Active unit dose orders START date/time is edited and there
 are more than one admin times the display outputs can be incorrect 
 and display corrupt data.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routine PSJUTL so that the correct Next Dose
 Due is displayed properly.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 No options need to be disabled.  It is best to install this patch during
 non-peak hours.  
  
 This patch should take less than 2 minutes to install.
  
 1.     Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.     Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3.     From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
        the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
        following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the
        patch #PSJ*5.0*361:
  
   a.   Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
   b.   Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
        (allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed.  It compares all components of this patch routines, 
        DDs,templates, etc.).
  
   c.   Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you

 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
   
 ;;5.0;INPATIENT MEDICATIONS;**[PATCH LIST]**;[DATE];[BUILD NUMBER]
    
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run 
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
   
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of 
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of 
 the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSJ*5.0*361 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSJ*5.0*361 in
 the patch list section on line 2.
