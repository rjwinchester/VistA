Subject: UNEXPIRED CLINIC MED AND INFUSION ORDERS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues:
 1.  Orders in the Inpatient Pharmacy package may not get their status updated
     to expired if the order's STOP DATE/TIME value matches the start time of 
     the ORMTIME RUN background job.  This is happening because ORMTIME RUN 
     and the pharmacy code compare the expiration time differently.  This is 
     happening for all inpatient pharmacy package orders, but is particularly 
     prevalent with clinic medication and clinic infusion orders. 
     
     This patch doesn't retroactively fix orders that were missed by the 
     expiration job. PSJ*5*340 is being developed to clean up the
     non-expired orders.  Until that patch is released, if any unexpired
     orders are identified and clean up assistance is needed, please enter
     a ticket with national Health Product Support for assistance.

 Overview:
 =========
 1. I13331849FY17 - Unexpired clinic med and clinic infusion orders
   
    Problem: 
    ========
    Several sites are finding clinic medication and clinic infusion orders 
    with old stop dates that are showing as "active" instead of expired 
    in CPRS and the Inpatient Pharmacy package.  The ORMTIME RUN background
    job is one of the processes that is responsible for expiring these 
    orders.  When examining these unexpired orders, they have a stop 
    date/time value which matches the time the ORMTIME RUN background
    job starts.  
  
    This will happen for all inpatient pharmacy orders, not just clinic meds
    and clinic infusions.  But it is less noticeable for inpatient pharmacy 
    orders since the process of accessing the patient's inpatient meds 
    profile will expire orders (ENUNM^PSJO1) so there is less of a dependency
    on the ORMTIME RUN job to expire them.  For clinic med and infusion 
    orders, where the profile is less frequently accessed, it is more 
    dependent on the ORMTIME RUN job.
  
    This problem was first noticed at Fresno VA which had ORMTIME RUN running
    every 5 minutes and they had many unexpired clinic med and infusion orders 
    - 69 from 4/2016 to 3/2017 - and as far back as 2000 but this problem may 
    extend even beyond that.  Other sites have found unexpired orders as well, 
    but relatively few.  Fresno has increased the frequency of ORMTIME RUN to 
    every 15 minutes but still sees new unexpired orders weekly.
  
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    A modification was made to routines ^PSJHL5 and ^PSJHLU to check for an
    expiration date that is less than or EQUAL TO the current time.
