 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 INC0812930  SAG: Order action and comment display incorrectly in CPRS on 
             orders tab, does not match order status
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 It was reported that during discontinuing of active IV order in backdoor 
 using the DC action and if the pharmacist attempts to exit out of the 
 discontinue action at the "Requesting PROVIDER:" prompt, software displays
 "Order Unchanged." message but order appearing as discontinued in the 
 orders column of the orders tab in CPRS. This cause confusion about the 
 order status and the sequence of steps that lead to the order appearing as
 discontinued in the orders column of the orders tab in CPRS.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routine PSIVORA and PSIVOPT2 to not update 
 CPRS if the pharmacist attempts to exit out the discontinue action using 
 the "^" at the "Requesting PROVIDER" prompt.
  
  
 Test Sites:

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:  
 ------------------------------- 
 It is not necessary to disable any options to install this patch.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded 
 with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The
 Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the
 backed up routines onto the VistA System.
