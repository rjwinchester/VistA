Subject: IV ORDER SHOWS WRONG DOSAGE/NON-VERIFIED ORDER BECOMES ACTIVE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues:
  
 1)  When placing an IV order, the "Instructions" field should not display 
     as it can be in conflict with the correct dosage amount. The same IV 
     order finished as a Unit Dose order will show  the "Instructions"
     field.  
  
 2)  A Pharmacist non-verified order was verified in CPRS by a Nurse
     which caused the order to become active.

 Remedy Overview:
 ===============
 1)  INC000000390624: 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The problem occurs if a physician places an IV order in CPRS with an 
    additive whose Orderable Item is attached to exactly one drug which is 
    marked as Unit Dose. The non-verified order will then be associated with 
    that Dispense Drug, and the strength for that Dispense Drug will then be
    imported into the Instructions field.
  
    Resolution:
    ------------
    Modified routine PSIVORFA so that the Dispense Drug and Instructions
    are only added to the order for Unit Dose orders.
  
  
 2)  INC000000910632:   
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A pharmacist processing pending orders had accepted, but not verified an
    order with intent of contacting the provider about the order.  While the
    order was in a non-verified status, a nurse verified the order in CPRS.
    The order subsequently became active and the nurse was able to administer 
    the medication in BCMA.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine PSJHL5 to comment out a line of code that was causing
    the nurse verified medication to become active.
