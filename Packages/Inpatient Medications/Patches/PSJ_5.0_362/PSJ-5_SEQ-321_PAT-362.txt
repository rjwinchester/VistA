 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 Item 1
 ------ 
 Problem:
 -------
 The VistA system should use the exact time sent from the vendor system as 
 long as it is no longer than 2 hours off the time in VistA.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Line tag FILETRAN^PSJPAD7I has been modified to allow a time gap of up to
 2 hours in the future, and if it is >2 hours then the transaction
 date/time will be set to NOW Date/Time.
  
 Item 2
 ------ 
 Problem:
 -------
 For a PADE user, the value of the SEND CHECKIN/SURG HL7 FOR INPT to 
 be honored for admitted inpatients only so that check-in messages will 
 always be sent for non-admitted patients regardless of the parameter's 
 value.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Line tag CLCI^PSJPDCLA has been modified to block check-in/Surg HL7 
 messages only if the patient is an inpatient and the flag SEND 
 CHECKIN/SURG HL7 FOR INPT is not set to "Y".
  
  
 Item 3
 ------ 
 Problem:
 -------
 As a user of the VistA PADE interface, the DISPLAY PADE INDICATORS IN IOE?
 prompt edit, through option 'PADE Inventory System Setup '(PSJ PADE
 INVENTORY SYSTEM), to not automatically reactivate devices that are 
 currently inactive, or to inactivate devices that are currently active.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The line tag PSJOE^PSJPADSI has been modified to not execute the code
 (D DEVONOFF^PSJPDRU1) to reactivate/activate the devices automatically
 when stepping over the prompt DISPLAY PADE INDICATORS IN IOE?
 The user will have the control to reactivate/inactivate a device.

 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended to be installed during non-peak hours to minimize potential
 disruption to users. This patch should take less than 3 minutes to
 install. 
   
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
   2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System (KIDS) menu,
      select the Installation menu.
  
   3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSJ*5.0*362).
     a. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
     b. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
     c. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
        components of the KIDS build.
  
   4. Select the installation option Backup a Transport Global. This
      option will create a backup message of any routines exported with 
      this patch in case you need to backout this patch. It will not
      backup any other changes such as Data Dictionaries (DD's) or
      templates. It is important this step be followed, because if backout
      of this patch is necessary, having the backup will make the process
      much easier.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
      PSJ*5.0*362.
  
   6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//"
      respond NO.
  
   7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
  ;;5.0;INPATIENT MEDICATIONS;**[PATCH LIST]**;16 DEC 97;[BUILD #] 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure:
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2 lines of
 the PSJ Routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines contained in the
 PSJ*5.0*362 patch have been rolled back, the first two lines of the 
 Routines will no longer contain the designation of patch PSJ*5.0*362 in
 the patch list section on line 2.
