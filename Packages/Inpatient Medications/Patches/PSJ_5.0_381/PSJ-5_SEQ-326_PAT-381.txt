Subject: GLUCOSE AND iSTAT TEST RESULTS NOT GOING TO VISTA

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 INC3409448-A site has reported that they have over 350 patient results
 that are pending and not transferring to Veterans Information Systems and
 Technology Architecture (VistA) and Computerized Patient Record System
 (CPRS). This includes Glucose and iSTAT results along with numerous other
 Health Level 7 (HL7) messages.

 INC3409448  Results from LA7POC1 and LA7POC2 for iSTAT and 
             Glucose testing are not going over to VistA
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 A site has reported that they have over 350 patient results that are 
 pending and not transferring to VistA and CPRS. This includes Glucose 
 and iSTAT results along with numerous other HL7 messages.
  
 It was found that the code to identify users that hold the PSJ PADE MGR 
 security key is bogging down the system which in turn is causing a backup
 of the HL7 message transmissions.  
  
 The users who hold the PSJ PADE MGR security key are gathered for a mail 
 group to inform them when a Dispense without Order (DWO) event has
 occurred.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The code in PSJPAD7I, that identifies the holders of the PSJ PADE MGR key, 
 has been modified to do a direct call into the cross-reference using the 
 security key, which is a faster process, instead of walking through the 
 entire NEW PERSON (#200) file to identify these key holders. 
  
  
 Test Sites:

 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------- 
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 2 
 minutes to install.
  
 1.     Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.     Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3.     From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
        Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following
        options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch 
        PSJ*5.0*381.
  
   a.   Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow
        you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed.  (It compares all components of this patch routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
   b.   Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
  
 4.     Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
 5.     From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option
        and choose the patch to install.
  
 6.     When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
        NO//', respond 'NO'.
  
 7.     When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? NO//', respond 'NO'.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from this patch description.
