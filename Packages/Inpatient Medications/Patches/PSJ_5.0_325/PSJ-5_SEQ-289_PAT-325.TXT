Description:
============

  Patch PSJ*5.0*325 adds a display of discontinued or edited IV orders from
  the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) to a pharmacist when
  processing an e-signed CPRS IV order using the following VistA option:
  
      "Non-Verified/Pending Orders" [PSJU VBW].
  
  This new feature applies only to wards or ward groups. The discontinued
  or edited IV orders will display prior to taking action to finish
  or edit the pending order.  This allows the pharmacist to pull IVs that
  are discontinued and prevent them from being sent to the patient ward
  and potentially be given in error.  It also allows the pharmacist to 
  perform a drug-drug interaction check, since recently discontinued 
  medications can still cause a drug interaction.  The pharmacist can delete
  the discontinued IV orders from the new IV MEDICATION ORDERS DC'D (#52.75)
  file when deemed appropriate.
  
  Note: This new feature is being distributed in the disabled mode.  Sites
  must decide whether to use the new feature for each IV room. Use the
  PSJI SITE PARAMETERS option to turn the report "ON" by setting the new
  parameter DC'D IV ORDERS HOURS FILTER (#21) to a positive number of
  hours for each IV room.
  
  The discontinued and edited records which are viewed in the update with 
  this patch are temporary and are stored in the new IV MEDICATION ORDERS
  DC'D (#52.75) file.  These records are only intended to help identify 
  discontinued IV orders for a particular ward or a ward group.  The records
  act as alerts and taking action on these records does not impact the actual
  order. Setting the parameter to zero will disable the new reporting
  feature and remove any existing records from file 52.75 that are associated
  with the IV room being edited.  Records for this new feature are
  captured and stored only after the feature is turned on.  For example, when
  a value of 24 hours is initially entered in the DC'D IV ORDERS HOURS
  FILTER (#21), the new report will start capturing DCed and edited orders from
  that point on.
  
  The following actions are available for records being viewed in the updated
  option:  
  
  (P)rint, (R)efresh, (D)elete, or (I)gnore
  
  --The (Print) action allows the viewed orders to be printed to a device and
    optionally those records can be deleted, once printed.
  --The (Refresh) action, simply re-displays the records.
  --The (Delete) action removes the currently viewed records from the file so
    they will no longer be displayed.
  --The (Ignore) action will continue with the usual next prompt and take no
    action on the records.
  
  Aside from helping to prevent medication errors, this modification also
  allows labels to be pulled for IVs that are not yet prepared. This saves
  resources, including the drug (especially helpful when drug shortages
  occur), and time spent managing pharmacy orders. For IVs that are already
  prepared, the modification allows reuse of the prepared bag on another
  patient while it is still within the expiration date.

   This new field (#21) provides a filter for the D/C'd orders report. 
   Discontinued IV orders older than the entered number of hours will not
   be included in the report.  Entering a zero in this field or deleting
   the field value will turn this feature off.  DC'd or edited IV orders
   for this IV room will no longer be stored and previously stored orders
   will be removed. The default value for this field is null.  If sites
   wish to use the new feature, they must use the PSJI SITE PARAMETERS
   option to update this new parameter to a positive number. 
  
    
  Options Associated:
  ===================
  The existing option, Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW], is updated to
  provide the new feature to review, print and delete the items in the new
  file IV MEDICATION ORDERS DC'D (52.75).
  
  The existing option, SIte Parameters (IV) [PSJI SITE PARAMETERS], is updated
  to allow the entry of the new parameter, DC'D IV ORDERS HOURS FILTER (#21).
  This new parameter provides a filter for the D/C'd orders report.  
  Discontinued IV orders older than the entered number of hours will not be 
  included in the report.  By entering a zero in this field, no D/C'd or
  edited orders will appear in the report. (See Post Install Instructions).
                 
  Protocols Associated:
  =====================
  PROTOCOL:                              ACTION:
     OR EVSEND PS                          USE AS LINK FOR MENU/ITEM/SUBSCRIBERS
     PSIVARH PHARMACY                      SEND TO SITE
  
  The OR EVSEND PS protocol is modified by adding the PSIVARH PHARMACY
  extended action protocol to it.  The new PSIVARH PHARMACY protocol processes
  the HL7 message with the inpatient pharmacy order and stores relevant
  information in the new file 52.75.
     
  Templates Associated:
  =====================
  INPUT TEMPLATE:                               ACTION:

  This input template is modified to provide the ability to edit the
  new field--DC'D IV ORDERS HOURS FILTER (#21) of the IV ROOM (#59.5) file.
  When the template is used to set the value of this new field (#21) to zero
  or null, then all entries in the new file IV MEDICATION ORDERS DC'D (52.75)
  associated with the current IV room, will be removed.
