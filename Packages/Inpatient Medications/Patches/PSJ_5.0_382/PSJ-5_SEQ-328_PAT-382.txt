Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following Inpatient Medications issue.
  
 INC3249148 - Clinic order is displaying as an inpatient medication when 
 user edits the order
      
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 INC3249148 - Clinic order is displaying as an inpatient medication when 
 user edits the order
           
 Problem: 
 ------------
 When a user enters a complex order as a clinic order for an outpatient 
 and edits a part (child) of the order after finishing that part of the 
 order, the order displays as an inpatient medication instead of 
 displaying as a clinic order.
      
 Resolution:
 ---------------
 When a part of a clinic complex order is edited, a new order for that 
 part of the order is created and the data that identifies an order as a 
 clinic order is not copied over to the new order. In order to remedy 
 this, the data that identifies the order as a clinical order is now 
 copied from the original edited order to the newly created order so that 
 the clinic order will be displayed as a clinic order and not as an 
 inpatient medication order.
   
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modified api CHK+43^PSJOEA1 to copy the value of the "DSS" sub node in 
 the scratch global ^TMP of the edited part (child) of the original order 
 to the newly created order's "DSS" entry of ^TMP.

 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;5.0;INPATIENT MEDICATIONS;**[PATCH LIST]**;[DATE];[BUILD NUMBER] 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
