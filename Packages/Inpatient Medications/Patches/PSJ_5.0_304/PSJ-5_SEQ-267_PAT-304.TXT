 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
  
 1.  INC000000858224
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When a user has a non-verified IV order and the additive triggers a critical
  drug interaction, and the user attempts to modify the infusion rate, an
  undefined error will occur. 
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routine PSGSICH was modified to kill the variable DO prior to the Fileman
  call.
  
 2.  INC000000942477
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When PSJ*5*284 was released, Network Channel compatibility was added to 
  send Pick List options.  The option EXtra Units Dispensed [PSJU EUD] 
  was overlooked for network channel. 
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routine PSGEUD was modified so that when using the Pick List option 
  Extra Units Dispensed (PSJU EUD) to send the Pick List to the ATC,
  it functions properly when using a Network Channel device.
  
  
 3)  INC000000969366
  
  Patient Safety Issue:
  ---------------------
  PSPO00002536
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When a pharmacist goes into Vista to verify orders using menu option 
  Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW], they are sometimes locked up 
  within the Vista session.  On occasion a stop date is being stored with
  quotes around it in the AIS cross-reference of the PHARMACY PATIENT FILE
  (#55).  When a pharmacist attempts to pull up the list of non-verified
  orders and they hit a stop date with quotes around it, the system is put
  into an infinite loop which locks up their user ID's. The pharmacist
  cannot continue to process these orders until they contact the help desk
  to have their session terminated, which unlocks their user ID.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Modified two routines, PSGVBW & PSIVACT, to prevent the infinite loop. 
  Modified the AIS cross-reference of the PHARMACY PATIENT FILE (#55) 
  to ensure only numeric values are extracted from the file. Also added
  the required HELP-PROMPT information for the STOP DATE/TIME field (#.03)
  of the PHARMACY PATIENT FILE (#55).
  
  A post-install routine (PSJ304PO) has been created to re-index the AIS 
  cross-reference of the Pharmacy Patient File (#55).

  Problem:
  --------
  Users are not able to select a patient with pending/non-verified Inpatient
  Medication orders using the option Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW]
  in Vista when the screen display is full, 20 orders, and there are no 
  further orders to display.  The prompt they receive is "^" TO QUIT when
  they should be getting the prompt Select 1 - 20:.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routine PSGVBW0 was modified so that the variable PSJASK is not reset when
  displaying the last medication order on the screen.
  
  
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
 ****************************** N O T E **********************************
   
   Please Verify Pre Checksums for Routine PSGEUD for Class III 
   modifications.
  
   PSJ*5*304 may contain a routine that may overwrite Class III 
   modifications for the ATC Devices at your site. Class III changes must
   be reinstated after installing PSJ*5*304.
  
 *************************************************************************
  
 It is advised to install this patch during non-peak hours.  The patch
 installation should take less than 2 minutes.  
 However, there is a post-install routine, PSJ304PO, that will be queued 
 which will re-index the "AIS" cross-reference of the 
 Pharmacy Patient File(#55). 
 The process time for PSJ304PO depends on the
 size of file #55 and a MailMan message will be sent to the patch
 installer upon completion. 
  
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
    the Installation menu.
  
 3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options (when 
    prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSJ*5.0*304):
  
    a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
        to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
        global.
    b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
        components of the KIDS build.
    c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow
        you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed.  It compares all components of this patch (routines,
        DD's, templates, etc.).
    d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
        message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not 
        backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSJ*5.0*304.
  
 5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//",
    respond NO.
  
 6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? NO//", respond NO.
  
 7. After successful completion of the post-install process, 
    the post-install routine, PSJ304PO, should be manually deleted.
