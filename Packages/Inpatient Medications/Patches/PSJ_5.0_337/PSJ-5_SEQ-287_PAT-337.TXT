Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch PSJ*5.0*337 will correct the following issues discovered with 
 Pharmacy Interface Automation (PIA) immediately after the release of patch
 PSJ*5*317:
  
  1) This patch addresses an issue with incorrect dosage for orders 
     containing more than one dispense drug when one of the dispense drug
     has a concentration or percentage strength. The HL7 interface sends
     one RXC component segment for each dispense drug, and the dosage sent
     on drugs where the strength is a concentration or percentage was found
     to be incorrect. When the strength is a concentration or percentage
     the dosage may be calculated incorrectly; therefore the dosage for
     these components will not be sent in the HL7 interface. For this type
     of order, the nurse dispensing the medication from the cabinet must
     manually verify the dosage for each component.
  
  2) Absent Sick In Hospital (ASIH) transfers were not tested prior to 
     the release of patch PSJ*5*317. After the patch was released, Long
     Beach reported that the "To ASIH" transfers are showing orders as
     active on the Omnicell server even though they are discontinued in
     VistA. Vendors like Omnicell use the admission pivot number as a
     unique identifier to track orders during their stay in the hospital.
     The HL7 message that was generated to discontinue the order was found
     to have a null value or an incorrect pivot number. Hence, Omnicell was
     unable to flag the order as discontinued.
     We also tested the "From ASIH" transfers, and we found similar issues.
     This patch will send the correct pivot number in the HL7 message for
     both (To/From) ASIH transfers so that the vendors can flag the orders
     accordingly.
  
  3) This patch addresses an issue with information missing from the 
     PADE OUTBOUND MESSAGES file (#58.72) when the site has multiple vendor
     setups. The first file entry has all the relevant HL7 data, but the 
     subsequent file entries are missing Order Number, Order Action, 
     appointment and Drug. With this patch, the subsequent file entries
     will have these missing data.
  
  4) This patch addresses an issue with Inpatient Order Entry that results
     in an undefined PSGORD variable error in routine ENDRG+17^PSGOEF1
     when a new (backdoor) order's orderable item is changed prior to
     accepting the order. After the New Order process is initiated in
     Inpatient Order Entry, and all of the order prompts are populated, the
     user is given the option edit the order details prior to accepting the
     order. If the user changes the new unaccepted order's Orderable Item
     to a PADE drug with more than one dispense drug associated with it,
     the following error occurs:
        <UNDEFINED>ENDRG+17^PSGOEF1 *PSGORD 
     With this patch, the dispense drug lookup will execute successfully
     when no order number is defined in the PSGORD variable.
  
  5) This patch addresses an issue with the Inpatient Pick List that 
     results in an undefined error when no unit dose order is found for the
     drug being processed, the following error occurs:
        <UNDEFINED>DRGSTOCK+10^PSJPADSI *PSJDFLOC 
     With this patch, the PADE drug balance lookup will not cause an error
     when no unit dose order number is defined.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 CA Ticket: I11154758FY17 - PADE messages calculate the wrong dose 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Problem:
 -------
  The HL7 interface sends one RXC component segment for each dispense drug 
  when there are more than one dispense drugs in the unit dose order. The 
  component dosage is calculated in each RXC by multiplying the units/dose 
  times the strength. This was calculating an incorrect component dose when
  the strength was a concentration or percentage.  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
  For an RXC segment which has a dispense drug where the strength is a 
  concentration or percentage; the component dosage will not be calculated 
  for that RXC segment.
  Routine PSJPADE was modified to not calculate the component dosage if the
  dispense unit contains a "/" or a "%"
  
  
 CA Ticket: I11111807FY17 - Vista is not transferring data to Omnicell
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Problem:
 -------
  "To ASIH" transfers are showing orders as active on the Omnicell server 
  even though they are discontinued in VistA. Omnicell uses the admission 
  pivot number as a unique identifier to track orders during their stay in 
  the hospital. The HL7 message that was generated to discontinue the order
  was having a null pivot value and in some instances was having the pivot 
  number associated with the new location (after transfer), preventing 
  Omnicell to flag the order as discontinued.
  
  Also, we found that the "From ASIH" transfers too had similar issues.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
  This patch will send the correct pivot number in the HL7 message for
  both (To/From) ASIH transfers so that the vendor (Omnicell) can flag the
  orders accordingly.
  Routines PSJPDCLU, PSJPDCLA and PSJPDCL were modified to retrieve the
  pivot number associated with the admission where the order was placed.
  
 CA Ticket: I11191473FY17 - PADE outbound log file missing fields
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Problem:
 -------
  When the site has multiple vendor setups, the first file entry in the 
  PADE OUTBOUND MESSAGES file (#58.72) has all the relevant HL7 data, but 
  the subsequent file entries were found missing Order Number, Order 
  Action, appointment and Drug.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
  Routine PSJPDCLU was modified to preserve the PDL array between calls to 
  LOG^PSJPADE, which kills this array. The PDL array is stored in PDLTMP
  prior to looping through the list of vendors subscribing to the message,
  and then set back into PDL before each call to LOG^PSJPADE.
  
  
 CA Ticket: I11300076FY17 - $ZE= ENDRG+17^PSGOEF1 *PSGORD PADE
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Problem:
 -------
  If a user changes a new unaccepted order's Orderable Item to a PADE drug 
  That has more than one dispense drug associated with it, the following 
  error occurs:  <UNDEFINED>ENDRG+17^PSGOEF1 *PSGORD.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
  Routine PSGOEF1 was modified for the dispense drug lookup to execute
  successfully when no order number is defined in the PSGORD variable.
  
 CA Ticket: I11420824FY17 - Undefined DRGSTOCK+10^PSJPADSI *PSJDFLOC PADE
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Problem:
 -------
  If a Pick List processes a drug for which no unit dose order is found, 
  the PADE drug balance lookup produces the following error: 
   <UNDEFINED>DRGSTOCK +10^PSJPADSI  *PSJDFLOC.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
  Modified routine PSJPADSI for the PADE drug balance lookup to gracefully
  handle the scenario where no unit dose order number is associated with
  the drug being printed.
