 This patch addresses one issue:
  
 VistA IV Quick Code schedule issue
  
  
 Patient Safety Issues (HITPS):

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 INC1731907  VistA IV Quick Orders
    dup  INC1844821
    dup  INC2261615
    dup  INC2419195
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 An order is placed in CPRS for an IV Additive using the Inpatient Meds dialog.
 When the Pharmacist goes to finish the order, instead of filling in all the
 fields for the IV order, he selects a quick code that has a schedule more 
 in-line with the medication ordered.  Thus the quick code has a different 
 schedule than what the Provider had entered via CPRS.
  
 When the order is completed the Schedule is not updated to the schedule
 defined in the quick code but remains the value the Provider entered.  The
 Admin Times field is updated to the appropriate Admin Times for the quick
 code that was selected by the Pharmacist.
  
 This issue was made more apparent by the MOCHA 2.1B Enhancement patch 
 that was nationally released in February 2018
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
  
 To resolve this issue, code was added to PSIVQUI to move the quick code
 schedule to the appropriate variable for the processing needed to update
 the order appropriately.
