Subject: 4 DIGIT YEARS/STOP & START DATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to implement the changes from NSR 20111103.
  
 Specifically, three changes are being made related to handling of 
 Inpatient Medication orders:
  
 1. In order entry options and selected reports, the year will now display 
 in four digit format.
 2. When a stop date is being entered or edited, there will be a hard stop 
 at 367 days. No stop date more than 367 from the start date will be 
 allowed.
 3. When a start date is being entered or edited, there will be a warning 
 given if the start date is more than seven days in the future.
  
 This patch also addresses three Defects:
 1. I13108353FY17     - There is an inconsistency for updating start date
                        when editing a starred field and a non-starred
                        field depending on when you perform the edit.
 2. RTC-Defect 561161 - Hard Error occurs when using Patient Profile 
                        Report (IV)  [PSJI PROFILE REPORT] for most
                        (but not all) Patient names.
 3. I8642889FY16      - Allergy Order Check related issue when one patient 
                        has medications checked against another patient's
                        allergies.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. I13108353FY17 - There is an inconsistency for updating start date when 
                    editing a starred field and a non-starred field
                    depending on when you perform the edit
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When a starred (*) field is edited on an active order with a past
     start date, it creates a new order and the start date is updated to
     today's date. However, if a non-starred field is edited first and then
     the starred field is edited, the start date is not updated to today's
     date. 
  
     Resolution:
     ----------- 
     Added line tag, CKDT^PSGOEE to routine PSJOE1 to check if a new 
     start/stop dates should be calculated when the edit will create a new
     order.
  
 2. RTC-Defect 561161 - Hard Error occurs when using Patient Profile 
                        Report (IV)  [PSJI PROFILE REPORT] for most
                        (but not all) Patient names.
  
     Problem:
     --------
     An error will occur when the option 'PSJI PROFILE REPORT' is 
     selected. Variable PSGP is undefined:
  
     <UNDEFINED>CHK+2^PSIVACT *PSGP
  
     The profile will not be created. 
  
     Resolution:
     ----------- 
     Added a set command to CHK^PSIVACT for the variable PSGP. It  
     is set to the patient DFN. This variable is used to select
     the patient's clinic.
  
 3. I8642889FY16 - Allergy Order Check
  
  
     Problem: 
     --------
     When processing unit dose orders for multiple patients, if the
     preceding patient has an allergy to a medication from the prior
     patients order, the user is receiving incorrect allergy order checks.
  
     Patient #1 - order for Penicillin, no allergy to this drug.  Patient
     #2 has an allergy to Penicillin but was prescribed Acarbose.  Patient
     #2 received an allergy order check for Penicillin.
  
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     A modification was made to ENKILL^PSJLMUDE to add the variable
     PSJALLGY to the exit process, which kills the variable so that it will
     no longer will be carried forward to the next patient.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 minutes
 to install.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
  
 1.      Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.      Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3.      From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
         the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the 
         following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the
         patch PSJ*5.0*373: 
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates. 
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this
         patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         routines, DDs, templates, etc. 
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.  Note that there may be a Before Checksum mismatch
         reported that is likely caused by the fact that PSJ*5.0*373 was
         copied from PSJ*5.0*336 which is now Entered In Error status, but
         was previously Released. However, there should be no Failures
         reported with the 22 routines checked. The values in the patch 
         description are correct.
  
 4.      From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s)
         option and choose the patch to install.
  
 5.      When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
         NO//', respond NO.
  
 6.      When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
         and Protocols? NO//', respond NO.

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 N/A
  
 Back-out, Rollback Instructions:
 --------------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch description.
