 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
  
 1)  I9190253FY16   Order displayed twice after edit if you press return
                      at QUIT.
 Problem
 --------
 When editing an IV order in option PSJI ORDER after the order is accepted
 the order summary is displayed twice.
  
 Resolution
 -----------
 The summary display routine EN^VALM is being called twice by two separate
 routines. Modifications have been made to routines PSJIACT and PSIVOPT to 
 determine if the order being processed is an active order and if so to 
 only display the order once.
  
  
 2)  I11117041FY17  Accept order prompt duplicated on IV orders
  
 Problem
 --------
 An IV order was modified, first with a starred field (START DATE) then
 a non-starred field.  The order was accepted, which resulted in a new
 order being created, but when the screen redisplayed the ACCEPT and
 EDIT were the only options displayed.  The user was not able to select
 VERIFY unless they up-caret out of the screen.
  
 Resolution
 -----------
 A modification was made to routines PSJLIACT and PSIVORC2 to allow the 
 display of the appropriate actions and not repeat the ACCEPT & EDIT 
 actions.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------ 
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------- 
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the  
     Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following
     options.  When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter PSJ*5.0*346:
  
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message
       of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not backup any
       other changes, such as DDs or templates.
    
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
       is installed. It compares all components of this patch:  routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
       
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
       global.

    Protocols? NO//", respond NO.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
  
 Installation Verification:
 ------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;INPATIENT MEDICATIONS;**[PATCH LIST]**;[DATE];[BUILD NUMBER] 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
