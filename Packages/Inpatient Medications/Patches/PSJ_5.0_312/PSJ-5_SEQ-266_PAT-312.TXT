 Remedy Overview:
 ===============
 1.  INC000000971226 
  
   Patient Safety Issue:
   --------------------
   PSPO000002540
  
   Problem:
   --------
   When Clinic Orders are finished by pharmacy with Start and Stop Dates
   greater than 72 hours in the past, they do not appear on the Long
   profile.
  
   Resolution:
   ------------
   The routine, PSJO1, was modified to ensure that the expired orders show
   on the Long profile.
  
  
 2:  INC000000983188
  
   Patient Safety Issue:
   --------------------
   PSPO000002553
  
   Problem:
   --------
   When the pharmacist is processing a pending one-time IV order and then 
   does a Speed Finish on a pending renewal for a Unit Dose order for the 
   same patient, the subsequent Unit Dose order will have the same Stop 
   Date as the IV order.  
  
   Resolution:
   ------------
   After exiting the option Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW], any 
   remaining variables will now be cleaned up so they are not held over 
   when another option is invoked.  (Option Non-Verified/Pending Orders 
   [PSJU VBW] was modified, no routines were modified.)
