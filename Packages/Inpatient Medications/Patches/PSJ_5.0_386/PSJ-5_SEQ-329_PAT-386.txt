 INC3938395  Pharmacy PADE issue
    
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 A clinic order was entered for an Outpatient patient, whom had just been 
 discharge.  The medication that was ordered is also marked as a PADE drug 
 where the sites PICK LIST had already been run for the future.
  
 When this order is finished in VISTA and verified, the user is seeing "The 
 next cart exchange is XX/XX/XX @ HH:MM" along with a value for Pre-Exchange 
 DOSES.  
  
 The user should not see a chart exchange message and the pre-exchange DOSES 
 should not have a value.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
  
 To resolve this issue, code was modified in routine PSGPEN to check if the
 order is a clinic order.

 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
