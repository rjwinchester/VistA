Description:
============

  
 ******************************* ATTENTION ********************************
   
 Clinical Ancillary Services (CAS) Development-Delivery of Pharmacy 
 Enhancements (DDPE) VA Inpatient Medication Administration - Transdermal
 enhancement includes 5 patches that must be installed in the following
 order:
  
 1.      PSS*1*191
 2.      PSJ*5*315
 3.      PSB*3*83
 4.      PSB*3*87
 5.      OR*3*417
  
 ATTENTION: This enhancement also includes a new Graphical User Interface
 (GUI) executable, BCMA GUI PSB3_P083.EXE. Installation of this GUI is
 required immediately after the KIDS install for the Patch to function.
  
 For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client 
 Installation Instructions section.
 **************************************************************************
  
 Patch PSJ*5.0*315 provides enhancements to the Inpatient Medications 
 application and to support enhancements for the Bar Code Medications 
 Administrations (BCMA) application for Transdermal Administrations. These 
 enhancements include:
  
      1. Currently Sites have to create fake removal orders to allow for 
 appropriate removal of medications in BCMA.  This patch will alleviate 
 that issue by prompting the user for DURATION OF ADMINISTRATION based on
 the value stored in the PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA field (#12) contained
 in the ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7).  This field implements changes that
 will support enhancements to the BCMA and Inpatient Medication
 applications to display the removal times in Inpatient Medication orders
 using rules determined by the value of this field. The PROMPT FOR REMOVAL
 IN BCMA field (#12) can be set for Orderable Items that require removal to
 the following values:
  
      NULL/0=No Removal Required 
      1 = Removal at Next Administration 
      2 = Removal Period Optional Prior to Next Administration  
      3 = Removal Period Required Prior to Next Administration
  
  
      2. Routines added for this patch will add the new DURATION OF 
 ADMINISTRATION prompt to the option Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] then 
 calculate the appropriate removal times and display them for verification.
 The NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1) and UNIT DOSE sub-file(#62) of the 
 PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) will be updated to include new fields that 
 will control the removal process.  These two files will have these 4
 fields added: DURATION OF ADMINISTRATION field (#137), REMOVE TIMES
 field(#138), REMOVE PERIOD field(#139) and BCMA PROMPT FOR REMOVAL FLAG
 field(#140).  A new field called PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA field(#12)
 created in the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#50.7) by patch PSS*1.0*191 will be
 used for information to be stored in the BCMA PROMPT FOR REMOVAL FLAG
 field(#140) in the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file(#53.1) and the UNIT DOSE
 sub-file(#62) of the PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55).
  
      3. The Edit Clinic Med Orders Start Date/Time [PSJ ECO] option will 
 have changes to anticipate these new fields and request additional user 
 activity when the orders require specific information that can 
 only be entered via the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option.
  
      4. This patch contains a post-install routine PSJ5P315 that sends a 
 report listing all legacy orders for Medications that require removal.  
 In order to prevent confusion by users of the BCMA GUI application these 
 orders will need to be discontinued and reordered to include the
 removal information.  This same report can be recalled from the Pharmacy
 Data Management [PSS MGR] menu using the Orders for MRRs With Removal
 Properties [PSS MRR ORDERS DIAGNOSTIC RPT] option.
  
      5. The Order View Hidden Actions Menu [PSJ LM ORDER VIEW HIDDEN
 ACTIONS] protocol has been modified to include a hidden action for calling
 the Administration History report. A new protocol, Admin History for OI
 [PSJ LM ADM HIST], was added for the new hidden action.  This report 
 allows viewing of other orders for the Orderable Item listed in the Order
 Detail for the selected Order. The menu item Other Pharmacy Options [PSJ
 LM OTHER PHARMACY OPTIONS] has been shortened to read Other Pharm Options
 in order to allow the columns to align correctly.  The AH menu option 
 will not be available during the period in which PSJ*5.0*315 is installed,
 but PSB*3.0*83 is not.  If the user attempts to run this option during 
 this time they will get the following message: Report not available until
 install of patch PSB*3.0*83.
  
        This patch requires patch PSS*1.0*191.
        
        The full functionality introduced in this patch will not be
        available until patches PSB*3.0*83 and possibly PSB*3.0*87 
        for Bar Code Back Up (BCBU) are installed.
  
        Pre-existing orders will remain unaffected with installation.
  
  
 ********** SPECIAL NOTE on Times Per Day (TPD) orders**********:
  
      To avoid confusion it is strongly recommended that  MRR medications
 needing to use a TPD schedule with asynchronous administrations and
 removals to have the PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA field (#12) set to a
 value of 3.  The Pharmacist will then always be prompted for the Duration
 of Administration and a proper removal time can be entered in the
 Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option. 
      
      In order to maintain adequate flexibility for Times per Day (TPD)
 schedules such as BID, TID and QID for MRR medication orders; these 
 schedules are not validated to the extent that other continuous schedule
 types are validated.  The intent was to allow a variety of administrations
 and removals that may be asynchronous in order to process correctly; for
 instance this will allow having two administrations 6 hours apart followed
 by a 12 hour medication-free period.
  
      Normally the frequency used by the existing ADMINISTRATION 
 SCHEDULE file (#51.1) setup would expect a 12 hour frequency for 
 continuous schedule types (24 hours divided by 2 administrations equals
 12) and this is what is standard practice.
         
      Existing MRRs set to have the medication removed at the next 
 Duration of Administration would need to have a Duration of Administration
 value entered for TPD schedules, otherwise the stored frequency in the
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) would be used and this could result 
 in an incorrect removal period.  Therefore we recommend setting the MRR
 value to a 3 (Duration of Administration Required). If the MRR is set to a
 value of 1 in the PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA field (#12), the Pharmacist
 would not receive the verification screen that appears for  Duration of
 Administration entries and may not be aware of this issue.
         
 The following is an example of using a type 1 Prompt for Removal in BCMA
 for TPD's (Not recommended Condition):
  
      The MRR medication needs to be administered at 0900 and removed 
 at 1500, with a new administration added at 1500 then removed at 2100.  
        
      The BID  schedule is used with the PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA
 field (#12)  value set to a 1 and the Frequency for BID schedule set to 
 12 hours.
      
      The Pharmacist would only see the administration times of 0900 
 and 1500.
        
      The system would then use the frequency stored in the 
 ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) of 12 hours, so that Removal
 Times on the enhanced BCMA would then calculate as removal at 2100 and
 0300, which would be in conflict with the administration times.
  
 The following is an example of using a type 3 Prompt for Removal in BCMA
 for TPD's (Recommended condition):
  
      The MRR medication needs to be administered at 0900 and removed 
 at 1500, with a new administration added at 1500 then removed at 2100.  
        
      The BID  schedule is used with the PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA 
 field (#12)  value set to a 3.  In this case the Frequency is no longer 
 used. 
        
      The Pharmacist would see the administration times of 0900 and 
 1500 and enter the appropriate Duration of Administration  which would be 
 6 hours.
        
      The system would create a verification display showing 
 administration at 0900 followed by and Administration and Removal at 1500 
 then a Removal at 2100 as ordered by the Physician.

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 The post-install routine generates a preliminary patient order 
 report listing the approximate number of active patient orders that may
 need to be discontinued and re-created.  This report is emailed to
 holders of the PSJI MGR, PSJU MGR, PSJU RPH, and PSJ RPHARM keys, and also
 the installer of this patch.  Please delete the post install routine 
 (PSJ5P315) after you have received this mailman report.
  
 Sites may periodically run "Pharmacy Data Management" [PSS MRR ORDERS
 DIAGNOSTIC RPT] under "Pharmacy Data Management" [PSS MGR] to update the
 preliminary estimates of active patient orders that may need to be
 discontinued and re-created.  They may need to do this if they aren't 
 able to process active orders right after install.  The report 
 should be run periodically after install to insure that all active 
 orders get cancelled and re-ordered.  Sites may also run the Orderable
 Items that Require Removal Report [PSS MRR ORDERABLE ITEMS RPT] under
 "Orderable Item Management" [PSS ORDERABLE ITEM MANAGEMENT] to verify
 which Orderable Items have been marked for PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA.
  
 After both PSJ*5*315 has been installed and PROMPT FOR REMOVAL IN BCMA 
 field (#12) have been updated for relevant orderable items, sites should
 generate a new "Orders for MRRs With Removal Properties" [PSS MRR ORDERS 
 DIAGNOSTIC RPT] report for the most current and accurate list of orders 
 that need to be addressed.
