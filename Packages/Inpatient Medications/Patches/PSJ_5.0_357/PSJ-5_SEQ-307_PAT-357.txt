 multiple dispense drugs that are not all ward stock items.

 the order and then add the second dispense drug that is WS, the user is not
 given the dosing options.

 WS item(s).

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded 
 with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The
 Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the
 backed up routines onto the VistA System.
