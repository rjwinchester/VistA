Subject: ALPHA SORT IN CPRS AND RENEWAL ORDER ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch makes 3 corrections to the Inpatient Medications package:
  
 1. In the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Meds tab, 
    the alphabetical sorting is not working correctly.
  
 2. After renewing and editing a complex order, the original order still 
    shows as active.
  
 3. A complex order renewed in CPRS will record the provider as the
    provider who originally placed the order, rather than the provider who
    renewed it.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC000000295440 - Drug (Alphabetic) Sort Needs Refinement
  
 Problem:
 --------
 This patch corrects two errors on the CPRS Meds tab when using the View 
 option "Sort by Drug (alphabetically), status active, status recent 
 expired" and the View option "Sort Status Group/Status/Location/Drug 
 Name".
  
 1.1 
 IV orders with no additive are not displaying in proper alphabetical 
 order on the Meds tab.  
 1.2
 Orders whose orderable items begin with a lower-case letter appear at the
 bottom of the list rather than displaying in alphabetical order.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Changed the routines PSJORRN and PSJORRN1 so that the Meds tab now
 performs the alphabetical sort correctly for these cases.
   
 2. INC000000363537 - Duplicates active orders display in IOE view
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
 Using the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] option, a complex order is 
 renewed, the Schedule Type edited, finished and accepted.  The previous
 order erroneously remains active and is displayed on the Order
 Entry screen.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Routine PSGOTR has been modified to kill the old "AU" cross reference 
 from the previous order that was causing the display issue on the 
 inpatient order entry screen.
  
 3. INC000000457954 - Renewed order reverts to original provider
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A complex order which is renewed in CPRS will record the provider as the
 provider who originally placed the order, rather than the provider who
 renewed it.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Changed PSGOTR so that renewing a complex order will now cause the name 
 of the renewing provider to appear as the provider for that order.
