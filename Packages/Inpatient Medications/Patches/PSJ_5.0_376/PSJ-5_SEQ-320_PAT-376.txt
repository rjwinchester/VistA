 INC2166518  PADE Dispense Without Order VistA Mailman messages not being
             received
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 When a medication is removed from an ADC (automated dispensing cabinet), a
 message is generated and sent in VistA to provide specific details surrounding
 the medication removed without a doctor's order. Those messages are NOT 
 being sent.
  
 The process to send these messages uses the 'Message from' name of "PADE".
 What is happening is that Mailman is using that string (PADE) to do a partial 
 lookup and finds a person in the NEW PERSON file who's name starts with PADE.  
 There actually are several in the file but the lowest IEN, or first match,
 is being used.
  
  
 The person that Mailman is finding does not have "send authorization" to the
 email group defined for the messages, thus the message isn't being sent.
  
  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
  
 The resolution is to modify routine PSJPAD70 to change the string in the
 variable XMDUZ from "PADE" to "PADE-SYSTEM".

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:  
 ------------------------------- 
 It is not necessary to disable any options to install this patch.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------ 
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 2 
 minutes to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch should take less than 2 minutes to install.
  
 1.     Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.     Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3.     From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
        Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following
        options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch 
        PSJ*5.0*376.
  
   a.   Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message of
        any routines exported with this patch. It will not backup any other 
        changes such as DDs or templates.
  
   b.   Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow
        you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
        installed.  (It compares all components of this patch routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
   c.   Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you to
        ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.

 6.     When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? NO//', respond 'NO'.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded 
 with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The
 Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the
 backed up routines onto the VistA System.
