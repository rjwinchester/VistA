Subject: PICK LIST/NATURE OF ORDER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issues:
  
 1. The check to determine whether a patient is on an active pick list is 
    not taking into consideration the pick list being flagged to be filed
    away. 
  
 2. Various workflows in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] can result in an 
    order having a Nature of Order of -1.  This corrupt data can cause an 
    <UNDEFINED> error to occur.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000210363 - Problem encountered with a patient record merge.
  
  Problem
  -------
  The check to determine whether a patient is on an active pick list is 
  not taking into consideration the pick list being flagged to be filed
  away. This will incorrectly prevent a patient record merge from 
  occurring.
  
  Resolution
  ----------
  Modify routine PSJPATMR to check the value of the FILED AWAY FLAG 
  field (#.04) on the DISPENSE DRUG SUB-FILE (#53.53) of the PICK LIST 
  file (#53.5) before determining if the patient is on a pick list.
  
  
 2. INC000000207717 - <UNDEFINED>STS+27^ORPRS04
  
  Problem:
  -------
  Various workflows in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] can result in an 
  order having a Nature of Order value of -1.  This corrupt data can 
  cause an <UNDEFINED> error to occur.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Changed PSJUTL5 so that the Nature of Order is no longer saved as -1, and
  further corrupt data will not be saved.
  
  Technical:
  ----------
  Older orders with a Nature of Order of -1 will not be corrected by this 
  patch; manual intervention will be required in order to change these
  fields to a valid value.  This correction cannot be done programmatically
  since user judgment is required on a case-by-case basis.
  
  Please see the POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS section for instructions.
