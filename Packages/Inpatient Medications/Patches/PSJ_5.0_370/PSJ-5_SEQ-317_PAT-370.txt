 INC0660799  Incomplete Medication Order Information
  
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 A unit dose order was placed in CPRS with long provider comments, in excess of
 15 lines including blank lines.  When finished and displayed in Vista and BCMA
 all is fine but when displayed in CPRS the comments are truncated.
  
 This order had 17 lines in total for the provider comments.  The 15th line
 was a blank line.  When the order is finished in Pharmacy, the Provider 
 Comments copied into Special Instructions, the code was deleting 
 the 15 line of the comment if it was blank due to a coding error.
  
 The code is looking at the total number of lines for the comment and it will
 delete the last line if it is blank.  What happened in the code was instead
 of looking at the last line in node 15, it was looking at line 15 of node 15.
 In this case it was a blank line and was deleted.
  
 When CPRS pulls up the order it appears to the user that the comments were
 modified and all lines after line 14 are not displayed.
  
  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A modification was made to routine PSJBCMA2 to ensure the correct number of
 comment lines are acquired.
  
  
  
 INC1220251  Special Instructions lost when new order is created due to edit
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When an edit is made to an active Unit Dose order where a starred field and the
 Special Instructions are modified, the original orders Special Instructions are
 modified as well.  The original orders history of Special Instructions are
 lost.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Modifications were made to routines PSJBCMA2 & PSJBCMA5 to ensure
 the Special Instructions are displayed on the proper orders when 
 a new order is created due to an edit.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:  
 ------------------------------- 
 It is not necessary to disable any options to install this patch.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------ 
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 2 
 minutes to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch should take less than 2 minutes to install.

        options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch 
        PSJ*5.0*370.

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded 
 with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The
 Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the
 backed up routines onto the VistA System.
