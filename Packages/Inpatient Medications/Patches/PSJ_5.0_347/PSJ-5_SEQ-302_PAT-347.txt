Subject: MOCHA 2.1B FOLLOW UP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 The Medication Order Check HealthCare Application (MOCHA) 2.1B patches 
 implement Max Daily Dose Order Checks for simple medication orders 
 entered through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), Inpatient 
 Medications and Outpatient Pharmacy. If the Daily Dose exceeds the First 
 Databank (FDB) recommended Max Daily Dose, a warning shall be displayed 
 to the user. If the Max Daily Dose Order Check cannot be performed, an 
 error message will be displayed to the user, along with general dosing 
 information for the drug in most cases.
  
 This patch is part of the MOCHA Enhancements 2.1B group of builds and is a
 component of the last build to be installed. Multiple package host files
 were created where possible to simplify installation at Veterans Health
 Administration (VHA) facilities. The combined build host file
 MOCHA_2_1_PSO_OR_PSJ.KID contains OR*3.0*382, PSJ*5.0*256 and PSO*7.0*402.
 The combined follow up host file MOCHA_2_1_FOLLOW_UP_PSO_OR_PSJ.KID
 contains this patch as well as PSO*7.0*500 and OR*3.0*469.  In addition,
 there are standalone Pharmacy Data Management patches, PSS*1.0*178 and
 PSS*1.0*206, which must be installed in conjunction with the other builds.
  
                               * * * Notice * * *
                   This group of patches should not be installed 
                       until the follow on patch PSO*7.0*515
            has been released and is ready to be immediately installed. 
                PSO*7.0*515 must be installed immediately after the
                  successful installation of this group of builds.
               See the PSO*7.0*515 patch description for details.
                               * * * Notice * * *  
   
 MOCHA v2.1B will provide the following enhancements:
 ===================================================
  
 1. The CPRS user should see only one warning message when the text in the 
 warning messages for the Maximum Single Dose Order Check and the Max 
 Daily Dose Order Check is identical.
  
 2. Incorporate routines (PSGOD & PSGOER) from PSJ*5*338 into PSJ*5*347.
  
 3. Correct the display text when verifying a non-verified Unit Dose order 
 which contains an Old Schedule Name through backdoor options, the user 
 shall be informed that the schedule name has been changed and of the new 
 schedule name.
  
 4. Resolves a limited issue when there are multiple entries with the same
 name existing in the Standard Administration Schedule file making it so
 the user cannot finish the Inpatient Med Unit Dose has been resolved.
  
 5. Resolves a limited issue when users could not finish a continuous IV
 order as an IV Piggyback.
  
 6. The DBIAs GETDATA^GMRAOR (#4847), GETDATA^GMRAOR(#4848), 
 ORCHK^GMRAOR(#2378) are no longer used. Remove the reference to these DBIAs in 
 PSGSICHK and PSJGMRA routines.
  
 7. Delete PSJDGAL routine as it's no longer used.
  
 8. When a patient has a pending clinic order, any pending unit dose(UD) 
 or IV orders will not be included in the order checks. The same for when 
 the clinic order is active, any active orders (UD for UD clinic, IV for 
 IV clinic) with the same stop date/time as the clinic order will not be 
 included in the order checks. This patch will correct this.
  
 9. Fix a subscript error at OTPRN+7^PSJBCMA3 enter a new inpatient unit
 dose order with a schedule " PRN" is entered. This schedule is not defined
 in the Standard Administration Schedule file.  
  
 10. Replace 2.2 with 2.2046226 for the weight conversion for the PADE HL7 
 ADT message.

 ----------------------------
 I5589877FY15 - Make Metric Conversions for Patient Weight Consistent
                across VistA Packages      
  
   Problem:
   --------
   In order to display the patient's weight in Kilograms (Kgs) the current
   conversion from Pounds (Lbs) to Kgs is being done by dividing the 
   patient weight on file by 2.2. 
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The weight calculation conversion from Lbs to Kgs is being modified to
   increase the precision of the patient weight in Kgs by dividing it by
   2.2046226 instead. This change will make the Outpatient Pharmacy
   consistent with Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).
  
   Technical Resolution:
   ---------------------
   Modify routines to calculate from pounds to kilograms to use 2.2046226 
   lbs/kg instead of 2.2 lbs/kg.

 ****************************** NOTE ************************************
 The 'Before' checksum values for routines PSGOD, PSGOER, PSGOEV, PSGS0,
 PSGSICHK, PSIVOCDS, PSIVSP, PSJLIFNI, and PSJOCDSD in this patch will
 appear incorrect.  This is because they are components of the preceding  
 patch PSJ*5.0*256 which is also part of the MOCHA 2.1B group of builds.  
 The FORUM Patch Module uses released checksum values to populate the
 'Before' fields below.  Since PSJ*5.0*256 will be released at the same
 time as this patch the FORUM Patch Module does not have access to the
 actual 'Before' checksum values.
