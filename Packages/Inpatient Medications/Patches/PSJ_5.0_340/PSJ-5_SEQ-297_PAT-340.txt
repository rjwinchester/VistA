Subject: CLEAN UP OLD EXPIRED ORDERS 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses one (1) issue:
  
 1.  Orders in the Inpatient Pharmacy package may not have had their status 
     updated to "EXPIRED", in the past, if the order STOP DATE/TIME value 
     matched the start time of the ORMTIME RUN background job.  This happened 
     because ORMTIME RUN and the pharmacy code compared the expiration time 
     differently.  
  
     This was corrected with patch PSJ*5*339, but a clean-up effort must
     be undertaken to place active/stopped Unit Dose and IV orders
     into expired status.

 I7822516FY16  - Clean Up Old Unexpired Orders
 R12279547FY17 (d)
 R10319922FY16 (d)
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Several sites found inpatient unit dose and IV infusion orders 
 with old stop dates that showed as active, instead of expired, in
 CPRS and the Inpatient Pharmacy package.  The ORMTIME RUN background
 job is one of the processes that is responsible for expiring these 
 orders.  All of the unexpired orders had a stop date/time value that
 matched the time the ORMTIME RUN background job started. ORMTIME RUN
 and the VistA Inpatient Pharmacy code compared the expiration time 
 differently and, as a result, many orders were skipped and never
 expired.
  
 This situation occurred for Inpatient Pharmacy orders, but it was less
 noticeable since the process of accessing the patient's inpatient med
 profile also expired orders and there was less of a dependency
 on the ORMTIME RUN job.  For unit dose and infusion orders, where 
 the profile was less frequently accessed, it was more dependent on the
 ORMTIME RUN job.  This issue was fixed with patch PSJ*5*339, but there
 are old unexpired orders on file and they need to be expired. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A post-installation routine, PSJ5P340, was written to address the issue and 
 expire the pharmacy orders that display an active status, yet are past the 
 stop/expiration date.
  
 The post installation routine creates a background task to run the
 clean-up process, so as not to delay installation.  The site installer
 will see the following message on their screen when the background
 task is initiated:
  
 =============================================================
 Queuing background job for PSJ*5.0*340 Post-Installation...

 A MailMan message will be sent to the installer upon Post
 Install Completion.  This may take an hour or more, depending
 upon site size.

  *** Task #XXXXXX Queued! ***
  
 The patch installer will receive the following MailMan message 
 notification of the job's completion.

   Patch PSJ*5.0*340 post-installation routine has updated
   the status of 1021 stopped / expired pharmacy patient
   orders from ACTIVE to EXPIRED.
  
   Information identifying orders that have had status
   updates from ACTIVE to EXPIRED will remain in
   ^XTMP("PSJ5P340",$J,DFN,IV/UD,UIEN) for 60 days.
  
   The following Pharmacy Patient file (#55) entries contain
   corrupt data and should be manually checked in FileMan.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 A post-installation job will run in the background when this patch is 
 installed.  The installer will receive an email when complete.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------- 
 It is not necessary to disable any options to install this patch.
 This patch may be installed with users on the system, although
 it is recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to 
 minimalize potential disruption to users.  This patch should take
 less than 5 minutes to install, but the background job could take
 over one hour to complete, depending upon the size of the site.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------- 
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
 3. From the Kernal Installtion and Distribution System Menu, select the  
    Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following
    options.  When prompted for the INStALL NAME enter the patch #  
    (ex. PSJ*5.0*340):
  
    a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup message

    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
       is installed. It compares all components of this patch:  routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
       
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
       to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
       global.
   
 4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    choose the patch to install.
  
 5. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
    NO//", respond NO.

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
  
 The post installation routine, PSJ5P340, is not automatically deleted
 as part of the installation process. You may delete it after installation 
 if you desire using the following command from programmer mode:
  
 MNTVBB>D ^%RDELETE
  
 Delete routines/INCLUDE files.
 WARNING: When <rtn>.MAC.0 is deleted, the latest backup is moved

 Installation Verification:
 ------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first 2 lines of 
 the routines contained in the patch. The second line will contain the 
 patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;INPATIENT MEDICATIONS;**[PATCH LIST]**;[DATE];[BUILD NUMBER] 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] can be run
 to compare the routine checksums to what is documented in the patch
 description.
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System.
  
 Data changes, as a result of the post-installation routine, can be 
 restored by using the ^XTMP("PSJ5P340" global as described above.
