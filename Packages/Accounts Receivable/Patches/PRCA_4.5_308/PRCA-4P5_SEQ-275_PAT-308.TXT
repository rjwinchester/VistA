 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC000001077579 Phase II algorithm adjustment for VA CARE vs. NON-VA CARE
 (Fee) identification in Vista Data Extract
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The CBO has requested changes based on the criteria to determine whether
 care provided on the bill is VA or Non-VA in the CBO Data Extract process.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The procedure for Veterans Affairs (VA) care vs. Non-VA care in routine
 RCXVUTIL was modified to follow the criteria as detailed below:
  
 - Added a new check for Clinic Stop Code: the bill is for Non-VA care if  
   the visit date/time and the hospital location for the outpatient are found
   and the Clinic Stop code is '669' in the Visit file (#9000010).
  
 - Added a new check for prosthetics item(s): the bill is for VA care if the
   associated prosthetics item is found in the IB Bill/Claims Prosthetics
   file (#362.5).
  
 - Modified the check for rate type: the bill is for VA care if the rate type
   is not 'Reimbursable Ins.' or none of these rate types locally defined in
   VA facilities: 'FEE', 'FEE BASIS', 'FEE-INPT', 'NON VA CARE', 'NON-VA',
   'NON-VA CARE', 'NON-VA FEE BASIS CARE'. 
  
 - Modified the check for prescription(s): the bill is for VA care if the
   type of the charge item is 'RX' and the associated prescription is found
   in the Prescription Refill file (#362.4), otherwise for Non-VA care if
   the associated prescription for the 'RX' type item is not found in the
   file (#362.4). 
  
 - Added a new check for bed section(s): the bill is for Non-VA care if the  
   associated bedsection of the charge item points to 'NON-VA CARE%' or
   'NON-VA CARE' or 'NON-VA CARE AT VA EXPENSE' in the MCCR Utility file
   (#399.1).
  
 - Added a new check for patient visit(s): the bill is for Non-VA care if
   the visit date for the outpatient is found in the Visit file (#9000010)
   and the associated hospital location contains 'NVCC' or 'NVC' or 'VCL'
   or 'NON-VA CARE' or 'NONVA CARE' or 'NONCOUNT FEE' or 'FEE BASIS'.
   Otherwise it's for VA care if the associated hospital location contains
   none of them.
  
 - Modified the check for outpatient encounter(s): the bill is for Non-VA
   care if no corresponding encounter for the visit date is found in the
   Outpatient Encounter file (#409.68).
  
 - Modified the final indictor as VA care for the bill if there is no above
   criteria being met.
