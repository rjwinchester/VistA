Category:

  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 *** Note:  This patch has a mandatory 3 day installation compliance.
   
 MCCF (Medical Care Collection Fund) Enhancement for uniform use of
 CARC/RARC (Claims Adjustment Reason Codes/Remittance Advice
 Remark Codes) Codes.
   
 This patch contains a fix for the installed patch PRCA*4.5*303. The 
 PRCA*4.5*303 patch released a routine RCDPEMSG to process CARC (File #345)
 and RARC (File #346) updates that will be sent from the Austin Financial
 Service Center (FSC) as mail messages to the mail group G.CARC_RARC_DATA
 approximately 3 times during a calendar year. The FSC has a subscription
 for the codes from the Washington Publishing Company 
 (http://www.wpc-edi.com).  The version of RCDPEMSG routine released in
 PRCA*4.5*303 does not handle adding new codes to files 345 and 346
 correctly. This emergency patch corrects this defect in routine RCDPEMSG.
  
 This patch implements changes to the Veterans Health Information Systems 
 and Technology Architecture (VistA) Accounts Receivable (AR) software
 requested by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Chief Business
 Office (CBO) Business Solutions to comply with legislative changes
 mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
 1996 (HIPAA) as amended by Public Law (P.L.) 111-148, the Patient
 Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), Section 1104.
