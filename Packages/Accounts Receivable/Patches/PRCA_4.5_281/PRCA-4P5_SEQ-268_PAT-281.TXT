Description:
============

  
 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_Prod_Overview_Guide_Group_8A.pdf) posted on the Anonymous
 directory for installation order. This is critical for proper 
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the implementation date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
 systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
 which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set.
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research.
  
 The purpose of this patch is to replace direct global reads into the ICD 
 OPERATION/PROCEDURE file (#80.1) and the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80) with a 
 DRG API $$CODEC^ICDEX instead.
  
 This patch updates one routine in the CBO Data Extract process. A DRG 
 Grouper API is being used to retrieve the ICD-9/ICD-10 procedure code or 
 ICD-9/ICD-10 diagnosis code for the data extract process to format and 
 place it in a flat file via a nightly process. The nightly process in the 
 Accounts Receivable Nightly Process Background Job option will then FTP 
 the data directly to the Boston Allocation Resource Center (ARC).
  
 The patch has been further enhanced to include an ICD procedure and 
 diagnosis code qualifier. The ICD code qualifier will identify the coding 
 system of the ICD procedure and diagnosis code, for example, 1 for 
 ICD-9-CM, 2 for ICD-9 Proc, 30 for ICD-10-CM, and 31 for ICD-10-PCS.
  
 ICD CODING SYSTEMS file (#80.4)
  
    1            ICD-9-CM
    2            ICD-9 Proc
    30           ICD-10-CM
    31           ICD-10-PCS
  
  
 The VistA AR package provides a Regional Counsel (RC) referral process, 
 whereby billing data is electronically transmitted for review by legal 
 counsel (Regional Counsel or Department of Justice).
  
 Note 1: The RC/DOJ Action Menu is used for this purpose. The Refer to 
 RC/DOJ and Review/Refer TP Bills to RC options are used to trigger the 
 transmissions to the RC database.
  
 Note 2: Additional details regarding these transmissions are documented 
 in the ICD-10 AR SDD.
  
 Note 3: The RC referral process currently includes the decimal in the ICD 
 diagnosis and procedure codes, and supports a maximum length of 10 
 characters for the codes. The ICD-10 diagnosis and ICD-10 procedure short 
 descriptions have been expanded in the ICD-10 code set to the maximum 
 length of 60 characters. The Regional Counsel database is able to 
 accommodate the 60 character ICD-10 short description without making any 
 modifications to their database. Due to differences in code set versions 
 for ICD-9 and ICD-10 the Regional Counsel (RC) referral process is being 
 tested for ICD-10 impact to insure that the process works with the 
 addition of code set version ICD-10.
  
 The VistA AR Regional Counsel referral process shall support ICD-10 
 diagnoses and ICD-10 procedures for bills that have ICD-10 data 
 associated with them.
  
   * ICD-10 diagnosis codes (up to 8 characters, including the decimal 
     after the 3rd character)
   * ICD-10 diagnosis short descriptions (up to 60 characters)
   * ICD-10 procedure codes (consisting of 7 characters, with no 
     decimal)
   * ICD-10 procedure short descriptions (up to 60 characters)
  
 The VistA AR Regional Counsel referral process shall continue to support 
 ICD-9 diagnoses and ICD-9 procedures for bills that have ICD-9 data 
 associated with them.
   
   * ICD-9 diagnosis codes (up to 5 characters, including the decimal 
     after the 3rd character)
   * ICD-9 diagnosis short descriptions (up to 24 characters)
   * ICD-9 procedure codes (up to 5 characters, including the decimal 
     after the 3rd character)
   * ICD-9 procedure short descriptions (up to 24 characters)
