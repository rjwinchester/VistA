Description:
============

    **************************************************************************
                     PLEASE NOTE - THIS PATCH HAS A SHORTENED
                            COMPLIANCE DATE OF 5 DAYS 
    **************************************************************************
  
 The purpose of this patch is to correct the Accounts Receivable (AR)
 Write-Off/Contract Adjustment (WR) document data when being sent to Financial 
 Management Systems (FMS).
  
 Prior patch PRCA*4.5*320 caused the contractual adjustment write-offs to not
 be able to be processed. These are FMS document transaction types WR 4N and WR
 08. Another side effect was the non-contractual adjustment write-off
 transaction type WR 37 was substantially increased. This patch will re-enable
 the correct processing of contractual adjustment write-offs.
  
 Note:  This patch is being released with a shortened compliance period because
 it is critical that all sites install this patch before December 2017
 month-end AR data collection activities begin.
