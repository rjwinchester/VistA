Description:
============

  *****************************************************************************
         This patch supports changes to the Veterans Health Information
         System and Technology Architecture (VistA) for the Treasury 
         Cross-Servicing Program (TCSP). PRCA*4.5*301 (Accounts Receivable-AR)
         is being released in host file: PRCA_45_P301.KID.
   
         It is imperative that these patches be installed no later than the
         compliance date.  Your understanding and support is appreciated.
  *****************************************************************************
   
  The Chief Business Office (CBO) requested modifications to the VistA
  Accounts Receivable Package to support the next phase in the implementation
  of the Debt Collection Improvement Act (DCIA) of 1996 by the Department of
  Veterans Affairs (VA).
   
  This patch modifies the Account Receivable (AR) v4.5 application as
  described below:
   
  1.  TOP Modifications
  -  Exclude first party bills from the TOP process unless the date the bill
     became active is prior to the Activation Date.  Do not exclude bills
     from the TOP process that are identified as referred to TOP.
   
  2.  DMC Referral Flag
  -  The VistA system shall not modify the 90-day DMC debt referral process.
   
  3.  Referral File
  -  The VistA system shall automatically create a file of delinquent first
     party bills.
  -  The VistA system shall create the file in IAI format, containing record
     types H, 1, 2, 2A, 2C, 3, Z.
  -  The VistA system shall schedule the batch process to create the referral
     file once per week for new referrals.
  -  The VistA system shall have the ability to stop a bill from being
     referred to Cross-Servicing.
   
  4.  Update File
  -  The VistA shall create a batch task to generate a file of updated
     information for previously referred bills.
  -  The VistA system shall create the file in IAI format, containing record
     types H, 1, 2, 2A, Z.
  -  The VistA system shall schedule the batch process to create the update
     file once per week for new referrals.
  -  The VistA system shall have the ability to stop a bill from being
     updated to Cross-Servicing. 
   
  5.  Recall File
  -  The VistA shall create a batch task to generate a file to recall
     previously referred bills by debt, debtor, or case.
  -  The VistA system shall create the file in IAI format, containing record
     types H, 1, 2, 3, Z.
  -  The VistA system shall schedule the batch process to create the recall
     file once per week for new referrals.
  -  The VistA system shall have the ability to stop a bill from being
     recalled to Cross-Servicing.
   
  6.  Reconciliation File
  -  The VistA shall create a batch task to generate a file of updated
     information for Reconciliation bills.
   
  7.  Monthly Patient Statements - Bills Referred to Cross-Servicing
  -  The VistA system shall exclude the value of bills that have been 
     referred to Cross-Servicing from the 'Previous Balance' and 'Balance'
     block on the monthly patient statement.
   
  8.  Monthly Patient Statements - Bills Not Referred to Cross-Servicing
  -  The VistA system shall include the value of bills in the 'Previous
     Balance' and 'Balance' block on the monthly patient statement when a
     bill is no longer referred to Cross-Servicing.
   
  9.  Unprocessable File - Bills that are sent for referral to Cross-
     Servicing but are deemed not valid are rejected and returned to
     VistA with the source of the error and the error code.  The rejected
     debts and error codes are stored historically and reported in debts
     profile reports and reject reports.
   
 10.  Due Process Notification (DPN) - A letter notification system for
     debts expected to be sent to Cross-Servicing.  From Cross-Servicing
     initialization, debts under $25.00 will be tracked for one year.  As
     the debts become qualified to Cross-Servicing referral, AITC will be
     notified to send due process letters.  After a sixty day waiting,
     if the debts become qualified, the debts will be referred to Cross-
     Servicing in the usual fashion.
   
 11.  Cross-Servicing Qualified / No Third Letter Sent - A bulletin will
     be generated by VistA when there is eligible debt for Cross-
     Servicing and a third collection letter has not been sent.  The
     bulletin will contain the debtor's name and bill number(s).
   
 12.  Activation Date - The VistA system shall not refer bills to
     Cross-Servicing if they were not active prior to the Activation
     Date.  For Little Rock #598, Beckley #517, and Upstate NY #528
     the Activation Date has been set to February 1, 2015.  For all
     other sites, the Activation Date has been set to August 1, 2015.

  Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
  =====================================
  Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
  patch is available.
   
  The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
  This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
  also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
   
  Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using Secure
  File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the
  following OI Field Offices:
    
  Albany:                 domain.ext
  Hines:                  domain.ext    
  Salt Lake City:         domain.ext
   
  The documentation will be in the form of Adobe Acrobat files.
   
  The following files should be downloaded in the binary SFTP mode.

  Patch Installation:
  ===================
   
  Installation Instructions:
  --------------------------
   
  This patch may be run with users on the system, however because the
  TOP options need to be placed out of order, we suggest it be
  installed after business hours (5PM), but not when the Accounts
  Receivable Background job is running (1AM). For large/integrated
  sites the weekend is the most favorable time for installation.
   
  This patch may take up to 8 hours to install.
   
  The following options should be disabled during installation:
   
          TOP Menu                           [RCTOP MENU]
   
  1.  OBTAIN PATCHES
      ==============
   
      Obtain the host file PRCA_45_P301.KID, which contains the following
      one patch install:
   
         PRCA*4.5*301
   
      Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following SFTP addresses.
      The preferred method is to SFTP the files from:
   
         download.vista.domain.ext
   
      This will transmit the files from the first available SFTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
      server as follows:
   
         Albany                  sftp.domain.ext
         Hines                   sftp.domain.ext
         Salt Lake City          sftp.domain.ext
   
      The PRCA_45_P301.KID host file is located in the 
      directory.  Use ASCII Mode when downloading the file.
   
  2.  From the Installation menu, select the LOAD A DISTRIBUTION option.
   
      When prompted for "Enter a Host File:", enter the full directory path
      where you saved the host file PRCA_45_P301.KID (e.g.,
      SYS$SYSDEVICE:[ANONYMOUS]PRCA_45_P301.KID).
   
      When prompted for "OK to continue with Load? NO//", enter "YES."
   
      The following will display:
   
         Loading Distribution...
   
         PRCA*4.5*301
   
   
  Use INSTALL NAME: PRCA*4.5*301 to install this distribution.
   
  3.  RUN OPTIONAL INSTALLATION OPTIONS FOR BUILD:
      ==================================================
      From the Installation menu, you may select to use the following
      options (when prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter
      PRCA*4.5*301):
   
      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch.  It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
   
  4.  INSTALL BUILD:
      ====================
      This is the step to start the installation of this KIDS build.  This
      will need to be run for PRCA*4.5*301 build.
   
      a.  Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the install.
      b.  When prompted for the "Select INSTALL NAME:", enter PRCA*4.5*301.
      c.  When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion
            of Install?" YES//  enter YES.

          install? NO//"  enter NO.
      e.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,

      g.  When prompted "Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of
          Order':"  enter <return>.
      h.  When prompted "Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//"  enter an
          appropriate number of minutes to delay the installation in 
          order to give users enough time to exit the disabled options
          before the installation starts.
      i.  When prompted "Device: Home//"  respond with the correct device.
   
  =================== POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ====================
   
  The post-install routine for patch PRCA*4.5*301 will flag debts
  currently under $25 for the Due Process Notification functionality.  In
  addition, the Cross-Servicing installation date is filed into the
  AR Site Parameter file #342.
   
  The user will see the following messages displayed in the installation
  log:
   
  >>>Cross-Servicing Start Date set to (current date).
  >>>Begin the Due Process Initialization.
  >>>The Initialization may take up to 8 hours.
  >>>Due Process Initialization is complete.
   
  The post install routine PRCA45301P may be deleted from the system if the
  post-install process has completed.
