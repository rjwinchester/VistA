 *************************************************************************
  
 NOTICE:
  
    The patch bundle PRCA IB MCCF EDI 1.0 (IB*2.0*530/PRCA*4.5*303) must
    be installed first, then install two standalone patches, IB*2.0*529
    and PRCA*4.5*304. Patch IB*2.0*529 must be installed before installing
    PRCA*4.5*304. Install all patches close together so that your site has
    all of the features released as part of this enhancement.
  
 *************************************************************************
  
  
 The Medical ePayments Compliance (Phase 2, Iteration 2) project ensures 
 the Veterans Administrations (VA) compliance with Electronic Funds
 Transfer (EFT) & Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) Operating Rules, and
 enables VA to more effectively use ERA data, resulting in better revenue
 and cash flow management.  It will provide the infrastructure foundation
 for electronic exchange of claim payment information and promotes an
 interoperable system and will reduce the time elapsed between receipt of
 the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) 835 Electronic Remittance Advice
 Transaction and receipt of the Cash Concentration or Disbursement (CCD+)
 transactions.  It will ensure that trace numbers between payments and
 remittances can be used by VA, reducing the level of open accounts
 receivable, allow claim denials to be more quickly addressed, and
 standardizes Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) & ERA enrollment to reduce
 workload burden on VA staff.
  
 This patch contains changes to the ePayments (835 and EFT) program area 
 to ensure compliance. Specifically, enhancements to the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Third Party
 EDI Lockbox module to increase timely and accurate processing of payments
 for electronic pharmacy claims in compliance with Health Insurance
 Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Veterans Health
 Administration (VHA) Fiscal Accounting policies will also be required.  
 The ePayments system is used by Accounts Receivable (AR) staff to process
 payments from third party payers for both medical and pharmacy claims. The
 objectives of the requested ePayments software modifications are to
 expedite accurate payments by enhancing the ePayments software to
 streamline the user's ability to process the pharmacy 835 while:
  
 Complying with HIPAA legislative requirements to meet patient needs and
 secure Protected Health Information (PHI).
  
 Conducting payment accounting in accordance with the Office of Management
 and Budget (OMB) directives.
  
 Systematically enforcing VHA Fiscal Accounting policy.
  
 This patch implements the following:
   - Auto-posting of Pharmacy ERA payments
   - Auditing of Suspense item processing
   - Allowing ERAs with data exceptions Auto-post after corrections
   - Allows re-use of Deposit Ticket #'s for manually created deposit
     tickets
   - Allows the Medical Auto-decrease functionality to specify maximum
     decrease amounts by Claims Adjustment Reason Codes (CARC)
   - Add Medical and Pharmacy filters to several reports

 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 ------------------------------
 N/A
  
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overviews:
 -----------------------------
 1. INC1269592/INC1282993: EFTs posted to paper EOBs are not showing up
                           on reports and causing stale dated lockups.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When processing EFTs with paper EOBs, EFTs are not marked as posted in
 VistA. Consequently, they are still showing up on reports and causing
 stale dated lockups. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 After investigating, this was determined to be a training issue as users
 at some sites were not properly closing receipts after the EFT was posted 
 to a paper EOB. No programming changes were needed.
  
  
 2. INC1289740: Auto-Posting of ERA line items does not always work.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 During auto-posting of (ERA) line items that were marked for
 auto-posting, if the payment amount was greater than the claim balance,
 processing of ERA line items stopped and the remainder of the line items
 did not process. In addition, the line items did not go back on the
 Auto-Post Awaiting Resolution (APAR) worklist.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Any ERA line items with a payment amount less than the claim balance will
 post. Any line items that cannot be posted due the payment amount being
 greater than the claim balance will be sent to the APAR worklist.
  
  
 3. INC1289572/IR277545: Receipt processing issues
  
 Problem:
 --------
 This was actually two separate problems related to receipts:
 3a. When an ERA has more than one receipt number, the APAR Header 
     displays the incorrect receipt numbers. 
 3b. When a user utilizes the Split/Edit action from the APAR worklist to
     put dollars into Suspense and enters a comment, the comment is not
     displayed on the Receipt Profile or the 215 Report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 3a. The APAR header was fixed to display the correct receipt numbers when
     there are multiple receipt numbers on an ERA.
 3b. There was conditional logic that was used when transferring comments
     to the ERA detail lines.  This conditional logic was removed and all
     comments are now transferred  Subsequently, the comments will be 
     displayed on the Receipt Profile and the 215 Report.
  
  
 4. INC1289748: The Auto-Post report does not correctly display split
                payments.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Auto-Post report does not correctly display split payments, including
 suspense payments. In addition, the receipt number does not always
 display correctly.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Auto-Post report now displays all payments, including split payments
 and suspense payments. The receipt number is now correctly displayed.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
  
 Note: 
    The patch bundle PRCA IB MCCF EDI 1.0 (IB*2.0*530/PRCA*4.5*303) must
    be installed first, then install two standalone patches, IB*2.0*529
    and PRCA*4.5*304. Patch IB*2.0*529 must be installed before installing
    PRCA*4.5*304. Install all patches close together so that your site has
    all of the features released as part of this enhancement
  
 There is a post installation routine which will initially prevent your
 site from auto-auditing medical and pharmacy bills, and auto-posting and
 auto-decreasing pharmacy ERAs.
  
 After the post-install is complete you can safely remove the routine 
 RC45P304. 
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is
