Subject: VA CARE VS. NON-VA CARE IDENTIFICATION IN VISTA DATA EXTRACT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two issues:
  
 1. The first issue involves the criteria checks to identify a bill for VA
    care or Non-VA care in the Chief Business Office (CBO) Data Extract
    process.
  
 2. The second issue is about the DMC Referred Report Print [PRCA RCDMC
    REFERRED RPT] option that opens the device twice resulted in the user
    being prompted twice for a message subject.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC000000527054 - Bug in VA CARE vs. NONCARE (Fee) identification in
                      VistA Data Extract (VDE)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The CBO has requested changes based on the criteria to determine
    whether care provided on the bill is VA or Non-VA in the CBO Data
    Extract process.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The procedure for Veterans Affairs (VA) care vs. Non-VA care in routine
    RCXVUTIL was modified to follow the criteria as detailed below:
  
  - Remove the data check in the fields - Lab Clinical Laboratory 
    Improvment Amendment (CLIA) number (#235), Homebound (#236), Date Last
    Seen (#237) of the Bill/Claims (#399) file for Non-VA care if the bill
    has associated with any of them.
  
  - Remove the data check in the field - Bill Classification (#.05) of the
    Bill/Medical Claims (#399) file for Non-VA care if it is Humanitarian
    Emergency (Inpt./Medicare Part B) on the inpatient bill.
  
  - Add the data check in the fields - Discharge Date (#70) and Ward At
    Discharge (#2.2) of the Patient Treatment File (PTF) file (#45). The
    inpatient bill is for VA care if the patient has been discharged with a
    ward assigned from the medical center, otherwise for Non-VA care.
  
  - Add the data check in the field - Status (#.12) of the Outpatient
    Encounter file (#409.68). The outpatient bill is for VA care if the
    patient has at least one associated outpatient encounter that is not a
    'Non-Count' encounter, otherwise for Non-VA care.
  
  - Default the final indicator as Non-VA care if the bill reaches the data
    check for outpatient encounters (see above) and there is no criteria  
    being met.
  
    Routine: RCXVUTIL
  
 2. INC000000824016 - Kernel-Devices/Printers Issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a site user queues the Debt Management Center (DMC) Referred
    Report Print [PRCA RCDMC REFERRED RPT] option to print on the P-Message
    device, the site user is prompted for the message subject and recipient
    information twice. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PRCAREPT was modified to remove the extra prompt to the user
    when the report is queued to print on the P-Message device.
  
    Routine: PRCAREPT
