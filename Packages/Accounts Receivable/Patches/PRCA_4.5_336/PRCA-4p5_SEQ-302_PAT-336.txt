 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1) I17391307FY18 - Veteran with foreign address not sent to TCSP 
                    correctly when debtor address node is missing.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Bills with First Party foreign addresses are not passing correctly to 
 Treasury causing a bad address reject type 45.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to the weekly TCSP batch run to ensure that 
 the correct country, state and zip code are set when a veteran address is 
 outside the United States and there is no address node in the AR DEBTOR
 (#340) file .
  
 The majority of these address issues deal with Canadian border VA sites 
 (Upstate NY & Fort Harrison).
  
 Routines: RCTCSP1, RCTCSP7, RCAMADD, RCTCSPD
  
  
  
 2. INC2776430 - Ensure a non-numeric phone number in the C2CA (Debtor
                 Contact Information) adheres to AITC and Artiva guidelines
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Vista patient phone numbers that are non-numeric or numeric length not
 equal to ten currently default to 9999999999. This number is not 
 accepted as valid by Artiva and the update is rejected and sent back 
 to Vista.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When building the IAI C2CA (Debtor Contact Information) transaction,
 a non-conforming phone number (not length 10, all numeric) will now
 be set to blank (positions 261-270). And, in addition, the Contact
 Phone Type (position 260) and Contact Primary Phone (position 275) 
 will also be set to blank.
  
  
 Routines: RCAMADD, RCTCSP1, RCTCSP7
  
  
  
 3) I17291574FY18 - Reconciliation and Due Process Notification (DPN) 
                    served messages using the same temporary work space 
                    ('RCTCSPD') as weekly batch runs.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Reconciliation Report and DPN messages via Mailman are processed 
 (served messages) using the same work file as the weekly batch run, 
 ^XTMP("RCTCSPD"). If either message was sent to a VistA system on a 
 Tuesday (cross-service batch run day), the possibility exists that the
 served message would erase the batch run compilation in the same work 
 file.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to the served message processing routines 
 for the Reconciliation Report and DPN messaging to use work files 
 ^XTMP("RCTCSP3SW") and ^XTMP("RCTCSPRSW") respectively, to avoid any 
 probability of killing/overwriting other processing.
  
 Routines: RCTCSP3S, RCTCSPRS
  
  
 4) I17654506FY18 - Ensure the date sent to cross-service is reset when a 
                    recall bill is rejected by Treasury.
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
 When a recall bill transaction is sent to the Treasury (via TCSP batch 
 run) and Treasury rejects the transaction, the returning reject message 
 does not correctly reset the DATE BILL REFERRED TO TCSP (#151) field in 
 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (#430) file.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to the Treasury reject message handler to 
 ensure that the current date is set into the DATE BILL REFERRED TO TCSP 
 (#151) field in the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (#430) file.
  
 Also, a post-install routine has been included to correct all bills that 
 are flagged as cross-service but date is missing in DATE BILL 
 REFERRED TO TCSP (#151) field in the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (#430) file.
  
  
 Routines: RCTCSJS, RCTC336P (post-install run) 
  
  
 5) I18597330FY18 - TCSP Scrubber fails to update node 16 in file ACCOUNTS 
                    RECEIVABLE (#430).
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Sites are scrubbing bills by setting the Treasury Cross-Service (TCSP) 
 date in the following options without creating a corresponding address 
 node 16 in the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (#430) file causing the weekly batch 
 run to fail if the bill is recalled.
  
 Option 1 - Set cross-service flag on bill
 Option 5 - Fully re-establish debtor/bill as cross-serviced
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to routines, RCDPCSA & RCTC336P, to create
 the bill address node 16 in the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (#430) file, for
 the, 'Set cross-service flag on bill' and 'Fully re-establish
 debtor/bill as cross-serviced', options. Also, for option 2 - Clear
 cross-service flag on BILL and option 3 - Clear cross-service flag on
 DEBTOR (AND ALL BILLS), the address node 16 will be deleted from the bill.
  
 Lastly, a post-install routine, RCTC336P, will ensure that all bills
 flagged as cross-service in the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (#430) file,
 will have address node 16 set to prevent any ongoing failures of the 
 weekly batch run regarding recalled bills (balances less than $25.00), 
 having no address node defined.
  
 Routines: RCDPCSA, RCTC336P (post-install run)
  
  
 6) I18917477FY18 - Debtor is being cleared when the last bill at Treasury 
                    is returned.
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Reconciliation Report and the served rejects from Treasury will clear 
 the CS debtor flag if the last open CS bill for debtor has been cleared 
 or when various batch rejection types are returned from Treasury.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modifications have been made to the served message handlers for the 
 Reconciliation report and the batch rejects sent by the Treasury system, 
 Artiva. The debtor will only be cleared if the veteran is deceased, but 
 clearing is not handled by CS processing.
  
 Removed check on Reconciliation R2 transactions to no longer check for 
 debtor open bills (active & >$25) and clearing CS flag on debtor if none 
 are found.
  
  
 Routines: RCTCSPRS, RCTCSJS
  
  
 7) I19188159FY18 - Cross-Servicing 5B records are not transmitting.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Patient bills that have decreases posted (i.e. payments, adjustments,
 etc.), create a 5B record that should be sent in the next batch run
 and at times are skipped due to other bill status checks prior to the
 processing of open 5B transactions.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modifications have been made to the batch run routine RCTCSPD to move the 
 check for 5B processing on bills to have priority over the referral flag 
 checking, that skips subsequent processing of a bill.
  
  
 Routines: RCTCSPD
  
  
 8) INC0543529 - Fix Cross Service (CS) reporting for IOP variable setup 
                 affecting other print options.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The setting of the printing variable IOP, after the printer setup query 
 will cause a false process when jumping out of the Cross-Servicing Bill 
 Report [RCTCSP BILL REPORT] or Print Cross-Servicing Report [RCTCSP 
 REPORT] print menu options to another option while printing.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to routine RCTCSP1 to ensure the setting of 
 the print control variable IOP is NOT set after calling the printer query 
 for device. This ensures variable IOP is not defined when jumping to 
 another print option.
  
  
 Routine: RCTCSP1
  
  
 9) INC1759367 - Update the Error Code file #348.5 with code 
                 additions/changes
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Treasury has been adding or modifying Integrated Agency Interface
 File Format For Cross-Servicing (IAI) Reject error codes and this
 patch, PRCA*4.5*336, updates the national Error Code (#348.5) file
 for any modified/new errors from the most recent version of IAI
 for Feb 2018. 
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The post install run has been updated to edit the codes 53 and 9A and add 
 the codes 0C and 0D.
  
  
 Routine: RCTC336P (Post Install run)
  
  
 10) INC1540432 - Patch PRCA*4.5*315 has not resolved TP bills populating 
                 'No 3rd Letter Report' for cross-servicing.
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The following Category codes were either left out of the batch run or not 
 coded correctly to be recognized as a code that skips any further 
 processing of a bill.
    47  FEE REIMB INS    (missing from exception string)
    49  INELIGIBLE HOSP. REIMB.  (coded incorrectly, patch PRCA*4.5*315 
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The weekly batch run has been modified to skip the processing 
 of a bill if the Category Code is 47 and correct the problem that 
 prevented Category Code 49 from being skipped.
