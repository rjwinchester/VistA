 MCCF (Medical Care Collection Fund) Enhancement for uniform use of
 CARC/RARC (Claims Adjustment Reason Codes/Remittance Advice
 Remark Codes) Codes.
   
 This patch implements changes to the Veterans Health Information Systems 
 and Technology Architecture (VistA) Accounts Receivable (AR) software
 requested by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Chief Business
 Office (CBO) Business Solutions to comply with legislative changes
 mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
 1996 (HIPAA) as amended by Public Law (P.L.) 111-148, the Patient
 Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), Section 1104.
   
 VHA uses the following standard, unique identifiers and Electronic Data
 Interchange (EDI) transactions in support of its third-party revenue and
 collections operation:
 - National Provider Identifier (NPI)
 - 270/271 Health Care Eligibility Benefit Inquiry and Response
 - 837 Health Care Claims - Institutional and Professional
 - National Council Pharmacy Drug Program (NCPDP) Pharmacy Transactions
 - 835 Health Care Claim Payment/Advice
 - Claim Adjustment Reason Codes (CARC)
 - Remittance Advice Remark Codes (RARC)
 - Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)
 - Electronic Explanation of Benefits (EEOB)
 - Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA)
 - Provider Level Balancing (PLB)
     
 This patch adds the following:
   - CARC/RARC Payer Report
   - PLB Adjustment Report
   - Transaction Audit Report
   - CARC/RARC Table Report
   - CARC/RARC Quick Search
   - Menu Items for above reports to the EDI LOCKBOX REPORT MENU
   - Efficiency enhancement by adding additional menu items to the AR
     ListManager screens to allow for streamlined research and problem
     resolution
   - New Reject indicator to show users at a glance if an EEOB was rejected.
   
 The following report was modified:
   - Active Bills with EEOB Report
   
 The following Menu Text items are changed:
   - EDI Lockbox is changed to EDI Lockbox (ePayments)
   - EDI Lockbox Reports Menu is changed to EDI Lockbox (ePayments) Reports
     Menu
   
 The server process RCDPE EDI CARC_RARC SERVER was created to process updates
 on CARC (File #345) and RARC (File #346) data. The Austin Financial Service
 Center will send mail messages to the mail group G.CARC_RARC_DATA
 approximately 3 times during a calendar year. The FSC has a subscription for
 the codes from the Washington Publishing Company (http://www.wpc-edi.com).
