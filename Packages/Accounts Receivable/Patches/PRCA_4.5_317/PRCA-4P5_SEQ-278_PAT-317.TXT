    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (PRCA) V. 4.5                    PRCA*4.5*317
  
  
 The purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements of the Medical Care
 Collection Fund (MCCF) Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Transaction 
 Application Suite (TAS) Phase 1 project as related to Accounts Receivable
 (PRCA). This project ensures the Veterans Administrations (VA) compliance
 with Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) and Electronic Remittance Advice 
 (ERA) Operating Rules, and enables VA to more effectively use ERA data,
 resulting in better revenue and cash flow management. It will provide the
 infrastructure foundation for electronic exchange of claim payment
 information and promotes an interoperable system and will reduce the time
 elapsed between receipt of the EDI 835 Electronic Remittance Advice
 Transaction and receipt of the Cash Concentration or Disbursement (CCD+)
 transactions. It will ensure that trace numbers between payments and
 remittances can be used by VA, reducing the level of open accounts
 receivable, allow claim denials to be more quickly addressed, and
 standardizes Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) & ERA enrollment to reduce
 workload burden on VA staff.
  
 This patch contains changes to the ePayments (835 and EFT) program area 
 to ensure compliance. Specifically, enhancements to the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Third Party
 EDI Lockbox module to increase timely and accurate processing of payments
 for electronic claims in compliance with Health Insurance Portability
 and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
 Fiscal Accounting policies. The ePayments system is used by Accounts
 Receivable (AR) staff to process payments from third party payers for
 both medical and pharmacy claims. 
  
 The following features of the PRCA software will be affected by this 
 patch.
  
 1. Unapplied EFT Deposits Report (UN)   [RCDPE UNAPPLIED EFT DEP REPORT]
    The Unapplied EFT Deposits Report was removed in patch PRCA*4.5*304. It
    is being reinstated in this patch and can be found on the existing menu
    EDI Lockbox (ePayments) Report Menu [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX REPORTS MENU].
    This report will function exactly as it did prior to its removal in
    patch PRCA*4.5*304 with one minor difference. The Receipt column of the
    report was expanded to allow 12 character receipts instead of 10 to
    accommodate the field length of the RECEIPT field (#344.4, .08) in the
    data dictionary.
  
 2. ERA Worklist/Scratch pad (WL)   [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST]
 *  ERA Worklist - Preferred View
      o  If the user has a preferred view, they will be prompted to use 
         their preferred view when entering the worklist prior to answering
         the worklist filter and sort prompts. If they elect to use their
         preferred view, the filter and sort prompts will be skipped and 
         the worklist will load using their values of their preferred
         view for these prompts. If they elect not to use their preferred
         view or if they do not have a preferred view for the worklist
         defined, they will be prompted to enter the new filter and sort
         values and will be allowed to save their answers as their
         preferred view.
 *  ERA Worklist - Change View
      o  Additionally, if the user selects the Change View action from the
         worklist the system will determine if the current worklist filter
         and sort settings completely match the settings of their preferred
         view for the worklist. If the user has a preferred view defined
         for the worklist and the current settings do not completely match
         the preferred settings, they will be prompted to use their 
         preferred view. If they elect to use their preferred view the
         worklist will reload using the preferred view settings. If they
         elect not to use their preferred view, or if they do not have a
         preferred view or the current settings do not completely match 
         the preferred view, the user will be prompted to enter the new
         filter and sort values for the worklist and will be allowed to
         save their answers as their preferred view.
 *  ERA Scratch pad - Preferred View
      o  When the user selects the Select ERA action to invoke the ERA 
         Worklist Scratch pad, the system will determine if the user has
         preferred view settings for the scratch pad. If the user has
         preferred view settings, they will be prompted to use their
         preferred view. If they elect to use their preferred view, the
         scratch pad preferred view settings will be used and the scratch
         pad will load. If they elect to not use their preferred view or
         they do not have preferred view settings defined for the scratch
         pad the user will be prompted to enter the filter and sort values 
         for the scratch pad and will be allowed to save those values as
         their preferred view.
 *  ERA Scratch pad - Change View
      o  When the user selects the Change View action from the ERA Worklist
         scratch pad. The system will determine if the current filter and 
         sort settings for the scratch pad completely match the settings 
         of their preferred view for the scratch pad. If the user has a
         preferred view defined for the scratch pad and the current
         settings do not completely match the preferred settings, they will
         be prompted to use their preferred view. If the elect to use
         their preferred view the scratch pad will reload using the
         preferred view settings. If they elect to not use their preferred
         view, or if they do not have a preferred view or the current
         settings do not completely match the preferred view, the user will
         be prompted to enter new filter and sort values for the scratch
         pad and will be allowed to save their answers as their preferred
         view.
   
 3. Auto-Post Awaiting Resolution (APAR)   [RCDPE APAR]
 *  APAR Worklist - Preferred View
      o  If the user has a preferred view, they will be prompted to use 
         their preferred view when entering the worklist prior to answering
         the worklist filter and sort prompts. If they elect to use their
         preferred view, the filter and sort prompts will be skipped and 
         the worklist will load using their values of their preferred
         view for these prompts. If they elect not to use their preferred
         view or if they do not have a preferred view for the worklist
         defined, they will be prompted to answer the filter and sort
         values and will be allowed to save their answers as their
         preferred view.
 *  APAR Worklist - Change View
      o  Additionally, if the user selects the Change View action from the
         worklist the system will determine if the current worklist filter
         and sort settings completely match the settings of their preferred
         view for the worklist. If the user has a preferred view defined
         for the worklist and the current settings do not completey match
         the preferred settings, they will be prompted to use their
         preferred view. If they elect to use their preferred view the
         worklist will reload using the preferred view settings. If they
         elect not to use their preferred view, or if they do not have a
         preferred view for the worklist defined or the current settings
         do not completely match, the user will be prompted to enter new
         filter and sort values for the worklist and will be allowed to 
         save their answers as their preferred view.
