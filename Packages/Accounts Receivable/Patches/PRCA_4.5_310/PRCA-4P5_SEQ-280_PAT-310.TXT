 Description
 -----------
 The Chief Business Office (CBO) is requesting system enhancements to the 
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) Integrated Billing (IB), Accounts Receivable (AR), and Fee
 Basis (FB) software modules that would allow segregating all billing
 and Collection activities for Non-Department of Veterans Affairs (Non-VA) 
 Care Third Party Insurance carriers' reimbursement.
  
 Current Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) Third Party billing and
 collections applications in the VistA information system do not
 segregate the Non-VA care claims from those claims for service rendered
 at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) healthcare facilities. This
 makes it difficult to determine whether all monies due VA for Non-VA
 care services are being billed and collected from Third Party 
 insurance carriers, where applicable. The current process is a resource
 intensive, manual process with no assurance that all applicable Non-VA
 charges have been billed and collected. 
  
 This project will improve and automate the transfer of data from VistA
 Fee Basis to Integrated Billing. It will record Non-VA revenue in a 
 different fund to allow separate tracking of these revenues. The patch 
 makes the following changes and enhancements:
  
 This patch creates entries in several AR files to support the new Rate
 Type of FEE REIMB INS. This new rate type is similar to REIMBUR. INS. and
 is used to segregate revenue generated by third party reimbursement of
 fee-based Non-VA Care. There are minor changes to revenue reports to 
 properly display the segregated revenue.
  
 1. An entry was added to the RATE TYPE file (#399.3) for FEE REIMB INS
  
 2. An entry was added to the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CATEGORY file (#430.2)
    for FEE REIMB INS
  
 3. Entries were added to the REVENUE SOURCE CODE file (#347.3) for FEE
    BASIS INPATIENT (8F1Z) and FEE BASIS OUTPATIENT (8F2Z).
  
 4. An entry was added to PRCD FUND file (#420.14) for 528713
    (MCCF-FEE-COLL FUND-3RD PARTY).
  
 5. An entry was added to PRCD FUND/APPROPRIATION CODE file (#420.3) for
    fund 528713.
  
 6. Revenue Source Code Report option (PRCA FMS RSC REPORT) was updated to
    Properly display the new revenue.
  
 7. Deposit Reconciliation Report option (PRCA DEPOSIT RECON REPORT) was
    updated to include the new fund.
  
 8. Calculate Revenue Source Code For a Bill option (PRCA FMS RSC CALCULATE) was
    updated to include the new source codes.
  
 9. Bad Debt Report option (PRCA NR BAD DEBT ACCR. REPORT) was updated to
    Include the new fund.
