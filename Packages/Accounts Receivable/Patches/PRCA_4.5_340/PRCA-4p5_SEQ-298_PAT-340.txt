    ****** NOTICE OF SHORTENED COMPLIANCE PERIOD ******
  
 Please note the above compliance date for this patch. This patch is being 
 released with a shorter-than-normal compliance period because of the 
 persistent problems being corrected by this patch.
  
    ***************************************************
  
 This patch is a follow-up patch to PRCA*4.5*315. It contains a number of
 minor defect repairs to the Reconciliation Report - Cross-Servicing [RCTCSP 
 RECONCIL REPORT] and to the Enter/Edit Repayment Plan option [PRCAC ENTER EDIT
 REPAYMENT]. In addition, this patch corrects some reported out-of-balance 
 discrepancy issues.
  
 The following is a complete list of the specific issues corrected.
  
 1. The old columns "AMOUNT PAID" and "AMOUNT OF FEES" on the Reconciliation 
 Report - Cross-Servicing [RCTCSP RECONCIL REPORT] were inaccurate. Further 
 investigation revealed that the data represented in these columns were not 
 reliably available. As a result, these columns were removed from this report.
  
 2. The header for the Recall Date in the Excel output of the Reconciliation 
 Report - Cross-Servicing [RCTCSP RECONCIL REPORT] was incorrect. This was 
 corrected.
  
 3. Leading zeroes of the SSN were lost in the Excel output of the 
 Reconciliation Report - Cross-Servicing [RCTCSP RECONCIL REPORT]. To correct 
 this issue, the Excel output was changed to have the last 4 digits of the SSN 
 preceded by the first initial of the last name to prevent the loss of the 
 leading zeroes. The heading was changed from SSN to PT ID.
  
 4. Device handler control variable IOP was being misused in the Reconciliation 
 Report - Cross-Servicing [RCTCSP RECONCIL REPORT]. This issue was corrected by 
 removing the usage of variable IOP.
  
 5. When entering a repayment plan in the option Enter/Edit Repayment Plan 
 [PRCAC ENTER EDIT REPAYMENT], the monthly payment amounts for a repayment plan 
 only accepted whole dollar amounts, not dollars and cents. This was corrected.
  
 6. The option Enter/Edit Repayment Plan [PRCAC ENTER EDIT REPAYMENT] did not 
 locate active bills for non-patient debtors. In addition, the display of the 
 payments received since the repayment plan date, did not show payments for 
 non-patient debtors. Both of these issues were corrected.
  
 7. The option Enter/Edit Repayment Plan [PRCAC ENTER EDIT REPAYMENT] was 
 unable to display older repayment plan information when the old repayment plan 
 data was filed incompletely in the database. A hard error detect was the 
 result. This was corrected by making the software more resilient to old, 
 incomplete repayment plan data that may exist in the database.
  
 8. The option Enter/Edit Repayment Plan [PRCAC ENTER EDIT REPAYMENT] had an 
 error when performing an Edit of an existing repayment plan. Under certain 
 conditions, the old repayment plan data was not completely removed when 
 filing the new repayment plan data. This led to inconsistent output in the 
 Profile of Repayment Plan [PRCAC PROFILE REPAYMENT] option. This was fixed.
  
 9. Because of new Cross-Servicing transaction types, multiple AR reports and
 screens showed Out-of-Balance discrepancy errors. These AR menu options 
 include Check Patient Account Balance [PRCA ACCOUNT CHECK], Statement 
 Discrepancy Listing [PRCA DISC LIST], and Bill Transactions [RCDP BILL 
 TRANSACTIONS]. Several routines were updated to recognize these new CS 
 transaction types and to process them appropriately. 
  
 10. New Cross-Servicing transaction types were also added into the monthly AR 
 Data Collection (ARDC) and FMS transmission processes so all of the new 
 transaction types which have dollar amounts are included.
  
 11. Corrupted data in the repayment plan nodes of bills caused errors in 
 Enter/Edit Repayment Plan. This was corrected.
  
 12. Certain specific situations caused deleted repayment plans to leave 
 data behind. This was corrected.
  
 13. Transactions filed by the Repayment Plan software were inconsistent. 
 Transactions are now filed for adding bills to repayment plans and 
 deleting repayment plans, but not edits to repayment plans.
  
 14. In Enter/Edit Repayment Plan, the word NONE was displayed for the
 non-medical debt list even if payments were listed. This has been 
 corrected.

 issue numbers associated with the items above.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC1025385 - Out-of-Balance Discrepancies
  
   Problem:
   -------
   Sites have reported balance discrepancies on two reports. Check Patient 
   Account Balance [PRCA ACCOUNT CHECK] and Statement Discrepancy Listing 
   [PRCA DISC LIST]. The balance discrepancies all have one of the new 
   Cross-Servicing transactions which have a dollar amount.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Modify the code in functions TBAL^PRCAGT and TRANBAL^RCRJRCOT by adding 
   new CS transactions #73 - CS INCREASE ADJ and #74 - CS ADMIN.COST 
   CHARGE.
  
 2. INC1080298 - Error in Enter/Edit Repayment Plan
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When attempting to view, edit, or delete an existing repayment plan 
   which is not correctly filed into the database, the following error
   detect can occur: <UNDEFINED>PLNDTL+18^PRCARPU *PLNFRST. This can 
   happen when there is data on the 4 node in file 430, but missing data 
   on the 5 node.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Update the PLNDTL^PRCARPU subroutine to account for the data situation 
   described above.
  
 3. INC1157548 - Error in Repayment Plan for non-patient AR debtors
  
   Problem:
   -------
   The Enter/Edit Repayment Plan [PRCAC ENTER EDIT REPAYMENT] menu option 
   is not able to process repayment plans for non-patient AR debtors. The 
   software needs to be able to handle repayment plans for AR debtors which
   are ex-employees, or vendors.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Modify the software in routine PRCARPU to use a different 
   cross-reference file to access non-patient AR debtors in addition to 
   patient AR debtors. Now all types of AR debtors are able to process 
   repayment plans using that menu option described above.
