Subject: CORRECT 5B RECORD FOR CROSS-SERVICING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is a follow-up patch to PRCA*4.5*315. It contains an important
 defect repairs to the 5B record in the Cross-Servicing file that reports 
 veteran debt to the Treasury Department. There will be a shortened 
 three-day compliance for installation of this patch to prevent incorrect 
 reporting of Veteran debt.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Defect #INC1333082 reported some veteran accounts that were paid in full
 were showing balances in Cross-Servicing that were double the original
 balance. It was determined that the payment transactions were being 
 reported to the Treasury incorrectly.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications were made to record 5B code to ensure that all increase 
 adjustments are sent as positive numbers and all other transactions are 
 sent as negative numbers that will reduce the balance of the bill.
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Defect I17391307FY18 reported that bills with First Party foreign
 addresses are not passing correctly to Treasury causing a reject type 45.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to the weekly TCSP batch run to ensure
 that the correct country, state and zip code are set when a veteran
 address is outside the United States and there is no address node in the
 file AR DEBTOR (#340). The majority of these address issues deal with 
 Canadian border VA sites (Upstate NY & Fort Harrison).
