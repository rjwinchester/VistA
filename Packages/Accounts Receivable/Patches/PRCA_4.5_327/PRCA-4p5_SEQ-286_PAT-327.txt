Subject: TCSP BATCH RUN CORRECTIONS;AR/RC RECONCILE ROLL-UP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following two issues:
  
 1) The weekly TCSP (Treasury Cross Service) batch run at site will error
    when the debtor is not defined in the debtor file.
  
 2) AR/RC Reconcile Roll-up emails have single mail address no longer
    used.
  
  
  
 Associated CA Tickets:
 ======================
 1) I14830000FY17 - Treasury Cross Service weekly job failed to transmit 
                    to AAC.
  
 2) II8333392FY16 - AR/RC Reconcile Roll-up emails have single mail 
                    address no longer defined.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1) I14830000FY17 - Treasury Cross Service weekly job failed to transmit 
                    to AAC.
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 At times bills are sent from Integrated Billing (IB) or Pharmacy with a 
 debtor that is no longer defined in the Accounts Receivable system in
 the AR DEBTOR (#340) file.  This undefined debtor causes the weekly TCSP
 batch run to fail due to an <UNDEFINED> error.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to the TCSP weekly batch run to bypass
 any debtors that are not defined correctly in the AR DEBTOR (#340) file.
 For those debtors found to be corrupted a mail message will be sent to
 the 'TCSP' mail group alerting the members to contact region IT staff
 immediately to correct the corrupt debtors.
  
  
 Also, code added to insure that work files are purged (deleted) entirely 
 after 5 days instead of the previous 3 day cycle.
  
  
 Lastly, control nodes were added to the compile process to allow a
 site to determine where the batch processing stands at any time and 
 sends an email to the 'TCSP' mail group when the process has been
 completed and transmitted.
  
  
  Routines: RCTCSPD, RCTCSPD0 (new), RCTCSP7 (new)
  
 Below are the two new mail messages that will be sent to the 'TCSP' mail
 group when a batch run is complete and the second message demonstrates
 the mail message for corrupt debtors.

 The following corrupted debtor records were found during the batch run.
 They can be found in xref ^PRCA(430,_"C"_) and have no file 340 entry or a
 corrupted entry (missing node 0 or 1).

 2) II8333392FY16 -  AR/RC Reconcile Roll-up emails have single mail 
                     address no longer defined.
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the monthly roll-up occurs on AR/RC Reconcile, the resulting data
 is mailed to various email addresses hard coded in the routine.  However,
 the outlook address is no longer active and needs to be removed from 
 the transmission.
  
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to remove the inactive email address 
 'OGCNASRI@MAIL.DOMAIN.EXT^OGCRegion8DeathNotification@mail.domain.ext'
 from the routines.
