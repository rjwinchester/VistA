Subject: REJECTIONS FOR DEBTOR/BILL SUBMISSIONS FOR FOREIGN COUNTRY ADDRESS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issue:
  
 The weekly TCSP (Treasury Cross Service) batch run at site does
 not set the correct address information in the C2CA message
 segment for veterans living in a foreign country.

 CA Ticket Overview:
 =================== 
 1)  I15730572FY17 - NECPAC -- Veteran Services -- Foreign address not 
                     processing through to Treasury
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 First Party foreign addresses are not passing over to Treasury Cross 
 Servicing due to a hard set that overrides the foreign address code and 
 will default to US address form. This causes the account to reject. 
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to the TCSP weekly batch run to 
 ensure that the correct country, state and zip code are set when a 
 veteran address is outside the United States.  The majority of these 
 address issues deal with Canadian border VA sites (Upstate NY &
 Fort Harrison).
