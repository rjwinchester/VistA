Description:
============

 Patch PRCA*4.5*347 modifies menu [PRCA RCDMC REFERRAL MENU] "DMC Referral
 Menu" to allow accounts receivable cross-servicing users to have the
 option to run four new reports for debt reconciliation. The new reports
 are option [RCDMCR4 0-40 PERC SC CHNG RPT] "0 to 40 Percent SC Change
 Reconciliation Report", option [RCDMCR5 1ST PARTY IB CANC RPT] "First 
 Party Charge IB Cancellation Recon Report", option [RCDMCR6 50-100SC EXMPT
 RPT] "50-100% SC Exempt Charge Reconciliation Report" and option [RCDMCR7
 10-40% COPAY RPT] "10-40% SC Med Care Copay Exempt Chrg Recon Report".
  
 1) [RCDMCR4 0-40 PERC SC CHNG RPT] "0 to 40 Percent SC Change
    Reconciliation Report" assists users in reviewing first party bills for
    veterans who received a new or updated change to a 0-40% Service
    Connected (SC) eligibility factor and received the change in VistA
    during the report time frame requested. This report prints information 
    on bills/charges without an IB Status of "Cancelled" and with an A/R 
    Status of Active, Cancellation, Suspended, Open, Write-Off, Collected/
    Closed or with an IB Bill Status of On Hold, for episodes of care 
    within a user selected time frame.  
  
    The report does not include bills for:
    a) debtors whose Service Connection is 50% or more, 
    b) debtors who are receiving a VA pension (regardless of their SC%),
    c) or debtors receiving Aid and Attendance
  
 2) [RCDMCR5 1ST PARTY IB CANC RPT] "First Party Charge IB Cancellation
    Recon Report" assists users in reviewing first party charges receiving
    Integrated Billing (IB) cancellation for potential refund activities or
    charge cancellation accuracy, and to identify and monitor cancellation 
    activity productivity so veteran customers can receive refunds due to 
    them for retroactive eligibility exemptions. The report provides data 
    for first party charges receiving IB cancellation for a user defined
    bill cancellation date range.
  
    The report also provides the option to print only bills with payments
    or print all bills within the user specified bill cancellation date
    range. If only bills with payments are printed, the report will include
    bills with an IB Status of "Cancelled" that have charges AND a payment.
    If all bills are printed, the report will include bills with an IB
    Status of "Cancelled" regardless of presence of payments.
  
 3) [RCDMCR6 50-100SC EXMPT RPT] "50-100% SC Exempt Charge Reconciliation 
    Report" assists users in reviewing all bills containing charges with
    a distinct date of service on or after the co-payment exemption 
    effective date for Veterans with Primary or Secondary Eligibility 
    equal to 50 to 100% Service Connected.
  
    The report captures any charges without an IB status of cancelled, and
    with an AR Status of Active, Cancellation, Open, Suspended, Write-Off,
    or Collected/Closed or an IB Status of On-Hold, with a date of service
    on or after the exemption effective date.
  
 4) [RCDMCR7 10-40% COPAY RPT] "10-40% SC Med Care Copay Exempt Chrg Recon
    Report" assists users in reviewing all medical care copayment bills 
    containing charges with a distinct date of service on or after the 
    copayment exemption effective date for Veterans with SC Percent equal 
    to 10 to 40% and does not show prescription copayment bills.
  
    The report captures any medical care copayment charge without an IB 
    status of cancelled, and with an AR Status of Active, Cancellation,
    Open, Suspended, Write-Off, or Collected/Closed OR an IB Status of 
    On-Hold, with a date of service on or after the exemption effective 
    date.
