 incorrect payments deducted from Veterans pension checks that were later 
 restored to Veterans.  This patch will mark the payments as incomplete 
 transactions.  The deposit tickets being marked start with the station 
 16822 followed by the 3 digit station number.
  
 ***************************************************************************

 * THE POSTING OF THE RECEIPT. ANY TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE MADE BY USERS TO *

 This patch will execute a post-install that will update the patient 
 accounts affected by the posting of the erroneous receipt.  It will mark 
 the payments as incomplete to prevent them from showing on the patient 
 statement.
  
 A mail message report will be generated and sent to the RCDP PAYMENTS 
 mail group at the end of the patch installation for each deposit found.  
 If a deposit is corrected, the report will list all the bills and the 
 transactions that was associated.  The transactions listed on this 
 report are the transactions that were set as incomplete in order to 
 remove the posting of the payments.  The bills balance for these 
 transactions and any repayment plans have also been adjusted.  It is 
 recommended that the bills listed on this report be audited to verify 
 their accuracy.
  
 Users will also have a related CR number corresponding to the deposit 
 indicated in a message "Error in Agent Cashier Receipts" as not being 
 processed in a Timely manner.  They will need to use the CR Entered 
 Online option under Receipt Processing to clear this CR from the list.
