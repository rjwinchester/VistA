 Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build 
 distribution BPS IB PRCA EPAYMENTS BUNDLE 1.0.
  
 The purpose of this software package is to increase automation of the

 Receivable (AR) staff and increase accuracy of the revenue operation.
   
 These changes include:
   
 1. Increasing automation of third party payer medical claims processing
    a. Automatic Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) posting (auto-posting)
       for ERAs associated with Electronic Fund Transfers (EFTs)

 3. Increasing automation of pharmacy claims processing
    a. Process standard National Council for Prescription Drug Programs
       (NCPDP) pharmacy fees
    b. Manage non-released prescriptions
   
 4. Enabling a switch-back solution through implementation of parameter
    questions
   
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
   
 1. The ePayments Site Parameter Edit menu was modified.
   
    a. The existing EDI Lockbox Parameters option [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX 
       PARAMETERS] is extended to allow maintenance of new parameter 
       values for the new automatic processing and posting prevention
       functionality. 
  
       These parameters include:
   
       - Enable Auto-posting of Medical Claims for the site
       - Payers to be excluded from Auto-posting
       - Enable Auto-decrease of Medical Claims for the site
       - Payers to be excluded from Auto-decrease
       - Number of Days to wait before Auto-decrease is applied
       - Maximum Dollar Amount for which Auto-decrease is allowed
       - Number of Days Allowed for Un-Posted Medical EFTs
       - Number of Days Allowed for Un-Posted Pharmacy EFTs 
    
    b. A new EDI Lockbox Parameter Report option [RCDPE SITE PARAMETER 
       REPORT] displays the parameter settings.
     
    c. A new EDI Lockbox Exclusion Audit Report option [RCDPE EXCLUSION 
       AUDIT REPORT] reports changes made to the excluded payer parameters
     
    d. A new EDI Lockbox Parameters Audit Report option [RCDPE PARAMETER 
       AUDIT REPORT] reports changes made to other parameters
    
 2. The Accounts Receivable Nightly Process Background Job [PRCA NIGHTLY 
    PROCESS] was modified to automatically create receipts for ERA if the
    following criteria are met:
    
    - Enable Auto-posting of Medical Claims parameter is set to 'Yes'
    - The Payer for the ERA is not excluded from Auto-posting 
    - ERA is matched to an EFT and the EFT receipt's status is 
      'Accepted By FMS'
    - ERA has no EXC exceptions and also contains no ERA level adjustments
   
 3. The Accounts Receivable Nightly Process Background Job was also
    modified to automatically apply contract decrease adjustments to claims
    which have been previously automatically posted if the following
    criteria are met:
   
    - Enable Auto-posting parameter for medical claims is set to 'Yes'
    - Enable Auto-decrease parameter for medical claims is set to 'Yes'
    - The Payer for the claim is not excluded from Auto-decrease or 
      Auto-posting
    - The number of days since Auto-posting exceeds the value of the 
      Number of Days to Wait before Auto-decrease parameter
    - The claim balance does not exceed the value of the Maximum Dollar
      Amount parameter
   
 4. The EDI Lockbox Reports Menu [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX REPORTS MENU] was 
    modified to include new ad-hoc reports of Auto-posting and
    Auto-decrease activity
    
    - A new Auto-post Report option [RCDPE AUTO-POST REPORT] displays 
      information on receipts created by Auto-Posting for selected
      dates and payers
    - A new Auto-decrease Adjustment Report [RCDPE AUTO-DECREASE 
      REPORT] displays Information on claims Auto-decreased for
      selected dates and payers 
     
 5. The EDI Lockbox menu option [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX MENU] was modified to 
    include a new Auto-Post Awaiting Resolution option [RCDPE APAR].
    This option allows for claim lines rejected by the nightly Auto-posting
    process to be reviewed and resubmitted for Auto-posting.
  
    Claim lines can be rejected for the following reasons:
  
    - The claim has been referred to General Counsel
    - The payment (or other pending payments) would generate a negative
      balance on the claim
    - The claim is no longer active
      
    Note that the new Auto-Posting Awaiting Resolution option [RCDPE APAR]
    is similar to the current EOB Worklist option [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX 
    WORKLIST] except that a receipt cannot be created directly.
    A 'Mark For Auto-Posting' action allows claims to be re-submitted to 
    Auto-Posting after review and correction. 
    
 6. The Decrease Adjustment option [PRCAC TR DECREASE] was changed to 
    display a warning message if a user tries to make a decrease adjustment
    on a bill that has at least one associated Electronic Explanation
    of Benefit (EEOB) marked for auto-post.
     
 7. Exception processing options were modified:
    
    a) The EDI Lockbox 3rd Party Exceptions option [RCDPE 
       EXCEPTION PROCESSING] is modified
   
    - The action to 'Transfer EEOB' is removed from the Data Exceptions
      screen
    - A new RCDPE ERA EXCEPT key is now required for use of the Delete 
      Message action
    - ERAs with payment method of Automated Clearing House can no longer
      be deleted
    - A record selection filter for Medical, Pharmacy or Both claim types 
      is also added to the EEOB Data Exceptions List Manager screen
    - For pharmacy claims the EEOB Data Exceptions List Manager screen now
      displays the ECME number and release date for pharmacy claims. If 
      the prescription is not released then entry and display
      of a comment is allowed
    - Exceptions due to non-released prescriptions are now cleared 
      automatically from the data exceptions list by the AR Nightly Process
      when prescriptions are released. The EEOB for the prescription are 
      then processed normally.
    
    b) The EEOB Transfer Reports option [RCDPE EOB TRANSFER REPORTS] was 
       removed from the EDI Lockbox Reports Menu [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX REPORTS
       MENU]   
    
 8. The matching of ERA claim numbers to the VistA database was improved
    for both pharmacy and medical claims. 
    
 9. The EEOB Worklist option [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST] was renamed
    ERA Worklist and has a number of new functions:
    
    - The capability to view an ERA without creating a Scratchpad is added
    - On the Worklist screen an 'x' is displayed against any ERA which has 
      exceptions and a warning is displayed if the users attempts to work
      the ERA before the exceptions are cleared
    - The Worklist screen displays a warning message if an ERA is selected 
      and there are other unposted EFT payments for medical claims more
      than 14 days old or pharmacy claims older than the number of days
      specified in the site parameters
    - The Worklist screen will prevent selection of an ERA when there are 
      other unposted EFT payments for medical claims more than 21 days old
      or pharmacy claims older than the number of days specified in the
      site parameters
    - Verification of ERA patient information against VistA claim
      for the Scratchpad is no longer case sensitive 
    - The Adjust (Inc/Dec) action on the Research Menu List Manager
      screen was removed
    - The Split/Edit A Line action in the Scratchpad screen is modified to
      transfer the correct payer name when editing EEOB with different
      payer names
    - The ECME number for pharmacy claims is displayed on the Scratchpad
      screen and on the View/Print ERA action
    
 10. A new Unposted EFT Override option [RCDPE UNPOSTED EFT OVERRIDE] was 
     added to the EDI Lockbox menu [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX MENU]. This allows
     users with the new RCDPE AGED PMT security key to override posting
     prevention in the ERA Worklist. The reason for the override must be
     entered as a comment.
    
 11. ERA selection criteria for the EEOB Worklist option [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX
     WORKLIST] can be saved as the preferred Worklist view for the user
     and will be re-used each time the Worklist is entered. The preferred 
     view for the user may be changed by using the Change View (CV) action
     in the ERA Worklist screen.
   
     A new filter for Medical ERAs only, Pharmacy ERAs only or both was 
     added and also included in the preferred view.
    
 12. The Batch Maintenance actions was removed from the Scratchpad screen
     in the EEOB Worklist option [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST].
    
     The Hide/Display Batch action is removed from the ERA List - Worklist 
     screen in the EEOB Worklist option [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST].
    
 13. Scratchpad display criteria for the EEOB Worklist option [RCDPE EDI 
     LOCKBOX WORKLIST] can be saved as the preferred Scratchpad view for a
     user and will be re-used each time the Scratchpad screen is entered.
     The preferred view for the user may be changed by using the CV action.
      
     A new filter for posted lines, un-posted lines or both was added and 
     also included in the preferred view. This is for Auto-Posted ERAs.
    
 14. For pharmacy claims the Release Date, ECME number and Date of Service
     are displayed in the Scratchpad View EEOB action for the EEOB
     Worklist option [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST].

 hours when there is minimal activity on the system. Avoid times when ERAs
 and EFTs are being received from the Financial Services Center (FSC). Of
 particular concern is the option below.
  
 TaskMan tasks will be queued at installation to perform post-installation
 activities.  When these tasks are complete the installer will receive 
 informational MailMan messages. No additional installation tasks will be 
 needed.
    
  1. Accounts Receivable Nightly Process Background Job
     [PRCA NIGHTLY PROCESS]
     Do not install the patch when the AR Nightly Process Background job is
     running. Wait for this job to finish or complete the installation 
     before this job starts.
    
 Pre-Installation Instructions

     2   Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the

 5.  INSTALL MULTI-BUILD
     -------------------
     This is the step to start the installation of this KIDS patch.  This
     will need to be run for the BPS IB PRCA EPAYMENTS BUNDLE 1.0.
      
     a.  Choose the Install Package(s) option to start the patch install.
     b.  When prompted for the "Select INSTALL NAME:", 
         enter BPS IB PRCA EPAYMENTS BUNDLE 1.0
     c.  When prompted "Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
         Install? YES//", enter YES unless your system does this in a 
         nightly TaskMan process.
     d.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
         YES//", enter NO.
     e.  When prompted " Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
         and Protocols? NO//", enter NO.
     g.  When prompted "Device: HOME//", respond with the correct device 
         but do not queue this install.
  
   Note: You may see this informational message during installation 
         of the multi-build:
  
         Not a known package or a local namespace
  
         This is because the name of the multi-build doesn't match a  
         namespace in the PACKAGE file (#9.4).
  
    
 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
  
    For production environments only:
  
 After the distribution is installed the vha835notify@domain.ext mail address 
 must be added to the RCDPE AUDIT Mail Group as a REMOTE MEMBER if it's 
 not already there.  This can be done via the Mail Group Edit 
 [XMEDITMG]option.
  
 This can be verified by a FileMan inquiry to the MAIL GROUP file (#3.8).  
 You should see this in the Mail Group:
  
 NAME: RCDPE AUDIT                       TYPE: public
   ALLOW SELF ENROLLMENT?: NO    
       ...
 REMOTE MEMBER: vha835notify@domain.ext
  
 In the DOMAIN file (#4.2) the Q-NPS.DOMAIN.EXT domain must exist and the 
 field 'FLAGS' must have a value of 'S'.
  
 For example:
  
 NAME: Q-NPS.DOMAIN.EXT                      FLAGS: S
   RELAY DOMAIN: FOC-AUSTIN.DOMAIN.EXT       DHCP ROUTING INDICATOR: NPS
   DISABLE TURN COMMAND: YES
  
 Please consult the MailMan documentation for additional information on 
 creating and editing Mail Groups and Domains.
