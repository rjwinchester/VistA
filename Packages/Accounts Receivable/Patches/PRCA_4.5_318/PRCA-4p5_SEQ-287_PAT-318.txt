    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (PRCA) V. 4.5                    PRCA*4.5*318
  
  
 The purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements of the Medical Care
 Collection Fund (MCCF) Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Transaction 
 Application Suite (TAS) Phase 1 project as related to Accounts Receivable
 (PRCA). This project ensures the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
 compliance with Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) and Electronic Remittance
 Advice (ERA) Operating Rules, and enables VA to more effectively use
 ERA data, resulting in better revenue and cash flow management. It will
 provide the infrastructure foundation for electronic exchange of claim
 payment information and promotes an interoperable system. It will
 reduce the time elapsed between receipt of the EDI 835 Electronic
 Remittance Advice Transaction and receipt of the Cash Concentration or
 Disbursement (CCD+) transactions. It will ensure that trace numbers
 between payments and remittances can be used by VA, reducing the level of
 open accounts receivable, allow claim denials to be more quickly
 addressed, and standardizes Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) & ERA
 enrollment to reduce workload burden on VA staff.
  
 This patch contains changes to the ePayments (835 and EFT) program area 
 to ensure compliance. Specifically, enhancements to the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Third Party
 EDI Lockbox module to increase timely and accurate processing of payments
 for electronic claims in compliance with Health Insurance Portability
 and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
 Fiscal Accounting policies. The ePayments system is used by Accounts
 Receivable (AR) staff to process payments from third party payers for
 both medical and pharmacy claims. 
  
 The following features of the PRCA software will be affected by this 
 patch.
  
 1. ERAs and EFTs must balance in order to auto-post
  
    Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) and Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)
    
    The software has been modified so that if either of the following
    situations are true the text " - UNBALANCED" is displayed as part of
    the EFT MATCH STATUS when it is displayed on the ERA Worklist 
    [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST].
  
    a. The ERA total amount does not equal the sum of all the Electronic
       Explanation of Benefits (EEOB) listed on the ERA.
  
    b. The ERA total amount does not equal the EFT amount.
  
  
 2. EFT Daily Activity Report [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX ACT REPORT]
  
    The EFT Daily Activity Report has been enhanced to include the
    corresponding cash receipt (CR) and transfer (TR) documents for
    any given EFT.
  
 3. Expanded the payer name to 60 characters on the following reports:
  
    a. EFT Daily Activity Report [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX ACT REPORT]
  
    b. EFT Unmatched Aging Report [RCDPE EFT AGING REPORT]
  
    c. Unapplied EFT Deposits Report [RCDPE UNAPPLIED EFT DEP REPORT]
  
 4. Security key: PRCFA SUPERVISOR
    
    Removed the existing security key PRCFA SUPERVISOR from the option
    EDI Diagnostic Measures Reports [RCDPE EDI NATIONAL REPORTS].
  
    The existing security key PRCFA SUPERVISOR was added to the
    following three options:
    
    a. Disable-Enable DM Background Job/Reports
       [RCDPE NR DISABLE/ENABLE]
  
    b. Manually Start DM Extract [RCDPE NR MANUAL START]
  
    c. Manually Transmit DM Extract [RCDPE NR MANUAL TRANSMIT]
  
 5. Placing transactions into Suspense
  
    When transferring monies from the ERA Scratchpad within in the
    ERA Worklist [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST] to suspense, through
    link payment, VistA accepts the word "suspense" independent of
    capitalization when entered by a clerk.
  
    When transferring monies from the Auto-Post Awaiting Resolution
    [RCDPE APAR], through link payment, VistA accepts the word
    "suspense" independent of capitalization when entered by a clerk.
  
    Auto-posting nightly processing has been enhanced with regards
    to records including those in suspense.
  
 6. EDI Lockbox Parameters [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX PARAMETERS]
    
    VistA allows a user to change the auto-post site parameters
    without getting kicked out of VistA.
  
 7. AUTO-POSTED RECEIPT REPORT [RCDPE AUTO-POST RECEIPT REPORT]
  
    Created a new report that details all receipts associated with each
    auto-posted ERA/EFT.  This new report can be found on the EDI Lockbox
    (ePayments) Reports Menu [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX REPORTS MENU] and on the
    Agent Cashier Menu [RCDP AGENT CASHIER MENU].
  
 8. Auto-Decrease Adjustment report [RCDPE AUTO-DECREASE REPORT]
    
    The Auto-Decrease Adjustment report [RCDPE AUTO-DECREASE REPORT]
    has been enhanced to display all decrease codes used in 
    adjudicating a claim and the dollar amount associated with the
    Claim Adjustment Reason Codes (CARC) and/or Remittance Advice Remark
    Codes (RARC).
  
 9. Enhance user actions on several user screens.
  
    Modified and added new user actions to the following existing
    screens.  These modifications included the use of two new
    security keys: RCDPEAR and RCDPEPP.
  
    a. ERA Worklist [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST]
    b. ERA Worklist [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST]  Scratchpad
    c. ERA Worklist [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST]  Scratchpad's
                                                    Research Menu
    d. Auto-Post Awaiting Resolution [RCDPE APAR] Scratchpad
    e. Auto-Post Awaiting Resolution [RCDPE APAR] Scratchpad's
                                                    Research Menu

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Do not install this patch while the "Accounts Receivable Nightly
 Process Background Job" [PRCA NIGHTLY PROCESS] is running. To avoid
 disruptions, this patch should be installed during non-peak hours
 when there is minimal activity on the system and there are no Accounts
 Receivable users on the system.
  
 Pre/Post install removes and then rebuilds the index associated with
 the field PAYER NAME (#.02) from the EDI THIRD PARTY EFT DETAIL
 (#344.31) file.  The pre-install also removes the existing PRCFA
 SUPERVISOR security key from the LOCK (#19, 3) field for the menu
 option EDI Diagnostic Measures Reports [RCDPE EDI NATIONAL REPORTS].
