 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1) I18403815FY18 - Duplicate IB transactions flagged incorrectly in AR
    DUP: I17919241FY18 - Account out of Balance due to false duplicates
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Sites have seen Accounts out of balance when Tier Rate decreases would 
 flag a previous increase transaction as incomplete when matching criteria 
 with a later decrease with a different transaction type.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to remove all duplicate decrease Tier Rate 
 charge checking introduced in patch PRCA*4.5*307. The code was determined
 not to be needed when VALID duplicates are sent to AR with the same date 
 and for same amount. These "duplicate" looking charges are actually 
 retroactive adjustments for previous visit similar rates, but all the
 adjustments are not dated using date of service, BUT, the date the
 adjustments occur, making them appear as duplicates.
  
 A bill lock was inserted to ensure transaction posting is stacked in a 
 sequential manner rather than slamming the bill simultaneously.

 2) I18833250FY18 - Weekly batch run temporary work files ^XTMP("RCTCSPD")
                    and ^XTMP("RCTCSPDN") have the purge control node 
                    incorrectly set causing the files to be purged the next
                    day and they should be kept for 5 days.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The ^XTMP weekly batch work files (RCTCSPD & RCTCSPDN) have an incorrect 
 zero node set which controls the purging criteria for the XTMP batch work
 files.  The batch work files are incorrectly purged the next day instead 
 of after 5 days.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to the creation of the ^XTMP batch work files
 insuring that the purge control node is set properly to only purge the 
 batch work file after 5 days, not the next day.
  
 Routines: RCTCSPD0
  
  
 3) I19435144FY18 - TOP weekly batch run temporary work file purge date
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The TOP ^XTMP weekly batch work file (RCTOPD) has an incorrect zero node 
 set which controls the purging criteria for the XTMP batch work file.
 The TOP batch work file is incorrectly purged the next day instead 
 of waiting for 5 days.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modification has been made to the creation of the TOP ^XTMP batch work 
 file ensuring that the purge control node is set properly to only purge
 the TOP batch work file after 5 days, not the next day.
