 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000127613 Statement Address Can't Print
  
   Problem:
   --------
   A site user reported that the CCPC Statement didn't get printed for those
   patients with this type of address 'ARMED FORCES AMER (EXC CANADA)'.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Modified routine RCCPCPS to store the State code and the Zip code in the
   AR CCPC STATEMENTS (#349.2) file for transmission when the patient lives
   on an American military base in a foreign country.
  
 2. HD0000000174653 Patient Statement Issue
  
   Problem
   --------
   The patient statements show erroneous dates for the admission date and
   the ending date of the billing cycling in the Reprint Patient Statements
   [PRCAE PR STATEMENT] option when the copay charges in Pharmacy were
   cancelled and the dispensed quantity for the prescription is a zero.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Modified routine RCCPCPS1 to check for a valid date format to insure
   valid dates are displayed by the option.
  
 3. HD0000000359236 <UNDEFINED>RUN+4^%ZTMS3
  
   Problem:
   --------
   A site user received the undefined error <UNDEFINED>RUN+4^%ZTMS3 during
   the process of the EEOB Transfer Reports [RCDPE EEOB TRANSFER REPORTS]
   option.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Modified routine RCDPETR to correct those undefined variables for the
   option, thus avoiding the problem.
