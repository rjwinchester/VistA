Subject: TROR AGING CHANGES FOR THE DATA ACT/ARDC REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch is part of an enhancement effort related to the Medical Care
  Cost Recovery National Database (MCCR NDB)Treasury reports and new
  requirements related to The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act
  (DATA Act). This patch updates the software component in each Veterans
  Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
  system that compiles and transmits the needed information to the
  National Database (NDB)  for submission to the Treasury. This
  information is sent to the central server on a monthly basis.
   
  This patch provides three enhancements:
   
  (1) For the NDB Accounts under 25.00 Report, the software will now 
  provide a count of debtors who have active bills that are older than 120
  days (a change from 180 days) where the balance of those bills is less
  than 25 dollars. Related data on delinquency shall also be based on 120
  days.
   
  (2) For the MCCR NDB Treasury S9 Report, the software will now report 
  receivables in more specific delinquent debt aging buckets, per the 
  mandate of the DATA Act. This patch will -
   
    Remove buckets for:                         Add buckets for:
   
    o 91-180 Days (+) and                       o  91 - 120 Days (+)
    o Over 1 Year (+)                           o 121 - 150 Days (+)
                                                o 151 - 180 Days (+)
                                                o 1 - 2 Years (+)
                                                o 2 - 6 Years (+)
                                                o 6 - 10 Years (+), and
                                                o Over 10 Years (+)
   
  (3) This patch also includes an enhancement related to the Accounts
  Receivable Data Collector (ARDC) Report. The Mailman message/bulletin,
  "ARDC Detail Report for MON/YYYY" will be discontinued and replaced. A 
  new report option ARDC Detail Report [PRCA ARDC REPORT] option is located
  in Reconciliation Reports [PRCAD RECONCILE MENU] option. The report will
  contain the same information as the discontinued ARDC Detail Report
  bulletin with the following changes:
   
    o The report shall include current status bills (New Bill, Active, 
      Returned for Amendment, Amended Bill, Open, and Suspended bills) 
      only.
   
    o The report shall include a column for the Fund number associated 
      with each line item on the report.
   
    o The report shall include a column for the Revenue Source Code (RSC)
      associated with each line item on the report.
   
  The patch has a shortened timeframe (*5 days*) for installation due to
  the strict timing required (in between reporting cycles) for patch
  installation. There is a small window of time for all sites to install
  the patch.

  Pre/Post Installation Overview:
  -------------------------------
  A post-installation routine (PRCA320P) will run upon patch installation
  to place the new ARDC Detail Report [PRCA ARDC REPORT] in the 
  Reconciliation Reports menu [PRCAD RECONCILE MENU]. It will also check 
  the accuracy of the "AC" cross-reference in file #430. 
  If you receive a note during the post install noting that the "AC"
  cross reference needs to be reindexed, it can be done at a later date, 
  but it should be completed before the [PRCA ARDC REPORT] option is ran.
