   WARNING!!!!
  
   If this patch, PRCA*4.5*338, has already been installed,
  
  
      ******************* DO NOT RE-INSTALL *******************
  
   This pertains to ALL sites, but with special attention to the 3
   test sites listed below:
    
  
     Edward J Hines VA Hospital (Chicago, IL) - Station 578
     Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center (Richmond, VA) 
        - Station 652 
     Central Alabama Veterans Healthcare System (Montgomery, AL) 
        - Station 619
  
  
   Doing so will cause the duplication of entries into the
   ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CATEGORY (430.2) file, which would prevent the

  Description
  ============
  The Office of Community Care (OCC) is requesting system enhancements to
  the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
  (VistA) Integrated Billing (IB), Accounts Receivable (AR), and Fee 
  Basis (FB) software modules that would allow segregating all billing
  and collection activities for Non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
  Care Third Party Insurance carriers' reimbursement.
  
  The primary goal of this enhancement is to increase timeliness and
  collections of billable Non-Veterans Affairs (VA) care services.
  Enhancements to existing VistA IB, AR, and Fee software applications
  would allow for increased efficiency in workflow processes leading to
  best practices that would ultimately be reflected in improved customer
  service to our Veteran population.
  
  The second goal of this enhancement is to prepare the IB and AR software 
  modules for the implementation of the changes required by the Maintaining
  Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks 
  (MISSION) Act.
  
  In order to meet these goals, this patch:
  
  1. Creates 36 new entries in the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CATEGORY file
     (#430.2).
   
     - Categories are included for Community Care (CC), Community Care 
       Network (CCN), Choice and TriCare.
   
  2. Creates 84 new entries in the REVENUE SOURCE CODE file (#347.3).
  
     - The entries were required to properly link the new AR Categories
       to the correct fund and accounting data.
   
  3. Adds 3 new fields to the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CATEGORY file (430.2)
     to streamline debt collection referrals for the active referral
     programs. The fields are REFER TO DMC (1.01), REFER TO TOP (1.02),
     and REFER TO CS (1.03).
  
     NOTE:  Referrals prior to 8/1/2015 will be reviewed for assignment 
            to TOP.  Referrals after 8/1/2015 are sent directly to TCSP as 
            appropriate.
                 
  
  4. Allows Contract Adjustments on all new Third Party AR Categories.
  
  5. Modifies the AR Nightly Process to check the new REFER to DMC field
     to see of a receivable can be sent to Debt Management Center (DMC)
     debt referral program.
  
  6. Modifies the AR Nightly Process to check the new REFER to TOP field
     to see of a receivable can be sent to Treasury Offset Program (TOP)
     debt referral program.
  
  7. Modifies the AR Nightly Process to check the new REFER to CS field
     to see of a receivable can be sent to Cross Servicing (CS) debt
     referral program.
  
  8. Modifies the Bad Debt report to correctly link the new AR Categories
     with their corresponding Fund and SGLs
  
  9. Modifies the Deposit Reconcilliation Report to allow the new First
     Party and Third Party Community Care (CC) AR Categories to appear.
  
  10. Modifies the Claims Matching Report to allow the new CC AR
      Categories to appear on the report. 
  
  11. Modifies the Revenue Source Code (RSC) Report to display all of the
      new RSCs generated for the CC project.
  
  12. Allows the Calculate Revenue Source Code option [PRCA FMS RSC 
      CALCULATE] to calculate the new RSC codes using the new AR 
      Categories.
  
  13. Associates the new AR Categories with their corresponding FUNDs.
  
  14. Associates the new FUND 528714 with its corresponding AR Categories.
