                   SCRIPTS EFTs
  
    Problem:
    ========
    Error <UNDEFINED>GETPHARM+21^RCDPEWLP occurs when user tries to post an
    Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) from the ERA worklist [RCDPE EDI
    LOCKBOX WORKLIST] option.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Routine RCDPEWLP was modified to check for the presence of the RELEASED
    DATE/TIME (#17) field in the REFILL (#52.1) sub-file of the PRESCRIPTION
    (#52) file before using it to prevent the error from occurring.
  
 2. I6485975FY16 - Cannot Reprocess Auto-posted Receipts if EFT Split Over
                   Several Receipts 
  
    Problem:
    ========
    The message "This receipt cannot be processed - the receipt total does
    not match the EFT total for this EDI Lockbox receipt" is received when
    reprocessing an auto-posted receipt using the Receipt Processing [RCDP
    RECEIPT PROCESSING] option. This happens when a Electronic Remittance
    Advice (ERA) spans several receipts and one is rejected by the
    Financial Management System (FMS). Patch PRCA*4.5*298 made changes so
    that the Electronic Remittance Advice (#344.4) file entries can have
    multiple receipts in the AR BATCH PAYMENT (#344) file.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    The RCDPURED routine was modified at section PAYTOTAL to total all of
    the associated receipts on file for the AR BATCH PAYMENT (#344) file
    entry.
