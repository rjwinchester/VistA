============

 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this patch along 
 with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (PRCA) V. 4.5                     PRCA*4.5*332
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                        IB*2.0*633
  
  
 The patches (PRCA*4.5*332 and IB*2.0*633) are being released in the
 Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build 
 distribution as PRCA_IB_EPAYMENTS_BUNDLE_4_0.KID.
  
  
 The purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements of the Medical Care
 Collection Fund (MCCF) Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Transaction 
 Application Suite (TAS) Phase 1 project as related to Accounts Receivable
 (PRCA). This project ensures the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
 compliance with Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) and Electronic Remittance
 Advice (ERA) Operating Rules, and enables VA to more effectively use
 ERA data, resulting in better revenue and cash flow management. It will
 provide the infrastructure foundation for electronic exchange of claim
 payment information and promotes an interoperable system. It will reduce
 the time elapsed between receipt of the EDI 835 Electronic Remittance
 Advice Transaction and receipt of the Cash Concentration or Disbursement
 (CCD+) transactions. It will ensure that trace numbers between payments
 and remittances can be used by VA, reducing the level of open accounts
 receivable, allow claim denials to be more quickly addressed, and
 standardizes Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) & ERA enrollment to reduce
 workload burden on VA staff.
  
 This patch contains changes to the ePayments (835 and EFT) program area 
 to ensure compliance. Specifically, enhancements to the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Third Party
 EDI Lockbox module to increase timely and accurate processing of payments
 for electronic claims in compliance with Health Insurance Portability
 and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
 Fiscal Accounting policies. The ePayments system is used by Accounts
 Receivable (AR) staff to process payments from third party payers for
 both medical and pharmacy claims. 
  
 The following features of the PRCA software will be affected by this 
 patch.
  
 1.  A new report EEOBs marked for Auto-Post Report (EMA)
     [RCDPE MARKED AUTO-POST REPORT] was added to the EDI LOCKBOX
     REPORTS Menu [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX REPORTS MENU].
     a) Allows the user to identify the users that marked an EEOB for
        auto-posting for a specified date range and other filter 
        criteria.
  
 2.  A new report Pending EFT Override Report (PEO) 
     [RCDPE EFT OVERRIDE REPORT] was added to the EDI LOCKBOX
     REPORTS Menu [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX REPORTS MENU].
     a) Shows a listing of unposted medical EFTs that are older than the
        limit set in the NUMBER OF DAYS (AGE) OF UNPOSTED MEDICAL EFTS TO
        PREVENT POSTING parameter in a list manger.
  
 3.  A new option Duplicate ERA Worklist (DUP) 
     [RCDPE DUPLICATE ERA WORKLIST] was added to the EDI LOCKBOX Menu 
     [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX MENU].
     a) Allows the user to see all the incoming ERA messages that were 
        determined to be duplicates.
     b) For each duplicate in the list, the user can view the detail, 
        delete the duplicate or file the duplicate as a new ERA.  If the
        user files the duplicate as new ERA, 'DUP' is appended to the end
        of the trace number to indicate that the ERA was created from a
        duplicate.
  
 4.  A new report Auto Parameter History Report
     [RCDPE AUTO PARAM HIST REPORT] was added to the Site Parameter Edit
     menu of the Supervisor's AR Menu.
     a) Displays a history of changes to auto-activity site parameters.
  
 5.  The user initials column on the List or Receipts Report 
     [RCDP LIST OF RECEIPTS REPORT] was expanded to show the first four
     letters of the user's last name followed by a comma followed by the
     first letter of the user's first name.  Note: if the receipt was
     processed by the Nightly job, the user's initials will remain 'ar'.
  
 6)  A change was made to the EFT/ERA Trending Report (ETR) 
     [RCDPE EFT-ERA TRENDING REPORT] to show the 'TOTAL DIFFERENCE 
     BETWEEN ERAs (PAID) - EFTs (COLLECTED): ' as the last line of the
     first page instead of the first line of the second page when the
     report is run in 'GRAND TOTALS ONLY' mode.
  
 7.  The following changes were made to the Active Bills With EEOB Report
     (AB) [RCDPE ACTIVE WITH EEOB REPORT]
    a) The filter question 'RUN REPORT FOR (A)LL EEOBs or (Z)ERO PAYMENT 
       EEOBs only: ALL//' was changed to 'RUN REPORT FOR (P)AYMENT EEOBs 
       or (Z)ERO PAYMENT EEOBs or (A)LL: ALL//'
    b) The report now includes EEOBs with a posting status of 'NOT POSTED'
       or removed.  Previously, these were omitted from the report
  
 8.  The following changes were made to the 'Manual Match' 
     [RCDPE EFT ERA MANUAL MATCH] action on the ERA WORKLIST 
     [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST].
    a) The name of the action was changed to 'ERA Manual Match'.
    b) After entering filtering criteria, a new list manager form is 
       displayed to show all the EFTs that partially match the ERA in
       weighted order such that the most likely EFT matches are 
       displayed at the top and the least likely matches are displayed at
       the bottom.  EFTs that only match the ERA by the payer TIN are
       not displayed in the list.
  
 9.  A new parameter 'NUMBER OF DAYS (AGE) OF UNPOSTED MEDICAL TRICARE TO 
     PREVENT POSTING:' was added to the EDI Lockbox Parameters
     [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX PARAMETERS].
    a) The default of the new parameter is 30.  The range is 14-60
    b) Any time the value of this parameter is changed, the change is 
       reflected in the EDI Lockbox Parameters Audit Report
       [RCDPE PARAMETER AUDIT REPORT].
    c) If the user tries to select an ERA associated with a Tricare 
       Payer in the ERA WORKLIST [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST], that
       contains EFTs older than the new site parameter, a lock-out
       error message is displayed.
    d) The user may override the Tricare lock-out using the Unposted EFT
       Override [RCDPE UNPOSTED EFT OVERRIDE] menu option.
  
 10. The 'Mismatched Procedure Code' error message that is displayed in the
     Third Party Joint Inquiry [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY] on the EP
     screen when a claim was billed electronically has been changed to
     'Claim was not billed electronically'.
  
 11. The Extended Check/Trace/Credit Card Search (EX)
     [RCDP EXTENDED CHECK/CC SEARCH] was modified in the following manner:
    a) The filter prompt 'Check, Credit Card or Trace #' was changed to
       'Check, Credit Card, Trace # or All' with a default of all.
    b) If 'All' is chosen for the filter above, the target string will be 
       searched as a Check, Credit Card and Trace #. If all is not chosen,
       the target string is only checked for selected search type.
    c) a minimum of three characters is required to perform the search.
    d) The search is case insensitive such that a search for trace number
       containing 'zzz' will also show results where the trace # contains
       'ZZZ'.
    e) If the user does NOT select 'All' as a search filter and the target
       string is not found, the user is then asked to perform a new search
       for the same target but a different search type.
  
 12.  When the user splits/edits a claim on an ERA line and puts all the 
      payment dollars into suspense, the associated EEOB is no longer 
      removed from the ERA Line. An EEOB is only removed from an ERA line
      when all of the payment dollars have been distributed to other 
      claims.
  
 13.  The Receipt Processing [RCDP RECEIPT PROCESSING] option has been
      modified in the following manner:
   a) When the user selects the Customize [RCDP DEPOSIT PROFILE CUSTOMIZ]
      action, prompt 'Do you want to show check, and credit card 
      information?' has been modified to 'Do you want to show trace #,
      check, and credit card information?'.
   b) If the type of payment of the receipt is 'EDI LOCKBOX', then the 
      trace # displays in lieu of the check and/or credit card information.
  
 14.  The Nightly AR Process has been modified in the following manner:
   a) A new site parameter 'ENABLE AUTO-AUDIT FOR TRICARE ELECTRONIC BILLS 
      (Y/N): No//' has been added to the EDI Lockbox Parameters [RCDPE EDI 
       LOCKBOX PARAMETERS] after the auto-audit parameter for Pharmacy.
   b) Any time the value of this parameter is changed, the change is 
       reflected in the EDI Lockbox Parameters Audit Report
       [RCDPE PARAMETER AUDIT REPORT].
   c) If auto-auditing of Tricare claims is turned on all new bills for 
      claims with payers flagged as Tricare will be audited.
  
 15.  The EDI Lockbox (ePayments) Reports Menu [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX 
      REPORTS MENU] has been re-organized with the following new sub-menus:
   a) A new sub-menu 'Workload Reports' [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX REPORTS WORKLOAD

      2. Active Bills With EEOB Report [RCDPE ACTIVE WITH EEOB REPOR]
