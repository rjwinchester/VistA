 Description
 -----------
 The Chief Business Office (CBO) is requesting system enhancements to
 The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) Accounts Receivable (AR), Integrated Billing (IB), and
 Outpatient Pharmacy (PSO) software modules.
  
 The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of
 Information & Technology (OI&T), is to provide benefits and services
 to veterans of the United States Armed Forces. In meeting these goals,
 OI&T strives to provide high quality, effective, and efficient
 Information Technology (IT) services to those responsible for
 providing care to the veterans at the point-of-care, as well as
 throughout all the points of the veterans' health care. The VA depends
 on Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) systems to meet
 mission goals.
  
 The overall FY16 Health Administration Product Enhancements (HAPE) 
 Revenue Enhancement project encompasses three New Service Requests (NSR):
  
 NSR #20150506
 The Revenue Eligibility Enhancements Project effort for the Chief
 Business Office (CBO), bundles several NSRs with similar business
 needs into a single requirements document.  Successfully addressing
 the requirements contained within this document will enable the
 VA to appropriately bill certain subsets of billable events by correcting,
 automating, or enhancing current VistA systems.
  
 NSR #20150507
 The Revenue Operations Enhancements Project combines several NSRs,
 as well. This effort enables the VA to improve revenue operation
 functionality related to repayment plans, late charge capture, bill
 suspension reasons, the billing of deactivated providers, and the display
 of appeal rights and responsibilities on the Veterans Beneficiary Travel
 Bill of Collections form. Implementation of the proposed enhancements will
 make a significant positive impact on stakeholders and target users.
  
 NSR #20150505
 The Revenue Reporting Enhancements Project will enable the VA to
 improve tracking and reporting of revenue, and will support revenue
 reporting business rules and guidelines.
  
  
 PRCA*4.5*315 patch enhancements, pertinent to the above NSRs, include:
  
 1.) By means of the new Enter / Edit Repayment Plan option, the user
 will create the Repayment Plan by debtor. Note: The 'Enter / Edit
 Repayment Plan' menu option name will replace the 'Set up Repayment
 Plan' menu option name.
  
 2.) On the Enter / Edit Repayment Plan option, if the AR Debtor has
 Active bills, the system will now display a selectable list of bills
 for the debtor.
  
 3.) On the Enter / Edit Repayment Plan option, when displaying a list
 of Active bills for the Debtor, the system will display steps to the
 user to set up the Repayment Plan.
  
 4.) On the Enter / Edit Repayment Plan option, once a Repayment Plan
 has been created or modified, the summary of the Repayment Plan is
 displayed.
  
 5.) On the Enter / Edit Repayment Plan option, the system checks to
 see if a Repayment Plan has already been created for the Veteran.
  
 6.) On the Enter / Edit Repayment Plan option, when choosing to Edit
 the Repayment Plan, all Active bills for the debtor will be displayed
 allowing the user to add new Active bills to the Repayment Plan as well
 as change the due date of first payment and/or the repayment amount due
 on the Repayment Plan.
  
 7.) On the Enter / Edit Repayment Plan option, if the Debtor does not
 have new Active bills that can be added to the Repayment Plan, the user
 will proceed to identify the repayment amount due and/or repayment
 amount due date on the Repayment Plan.
  
 8.) On the Enter / Edit Repayment Plan option, a designated identifier
 will signify when an Active bill is part of a Repayment Plan.
  
 9.) On the Enter / Edit Repayment Plan option, the system will display
 previously made payments to the Repayment Plan.
  
 10.) On the Enter / Edit Repayment Plan option, the User has the option
 to enter Debtor Comments during the setup process.
  
 11.) The AR Clerk will be able to select Suspended Type from the menu
 to display in the Status Listing For Bills [PRCAL STATUS LIST] report.
  
 12.) Status Listing For Bills [PRCAL STATUS LIST] report shall be
 modified to incorporate reason for suspension.
  
 13.) Provide the ability to lock the option to update late payment
 charges (Interest/Admin/Penalty Rates [PRCAF U ADMIN.RATE]) with a new
 security key.
  
 14.) The system will allow the user to identify if the Bill of
 Collections letter applies to Veterans Beneficiary Travel (Form 1114).
  
 15.) The system will print the Notice of Rights and Responsibilities
 when the Bill of Collections pertains to Veterans Beneficiary Travel.
  
 16.) Currently, when non-healthcare debt of $25 or greater is in a
 delinquent status for 180 days, VistA transmits this debt to Treasury
 Offset Program (TOP) (via Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) 
 and Debt Management Center (DMC)) for initiation of the standard 
 collection process. To maintain compliance with The Digital Accountability
 and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) the 180-day date parameter shall
 be changed to 120 days.
  
 17.)  A new audit trail is needed for detailing events or transactions
 that have occurred on healthcare debts referred for debt collection, to
 effectively support Veterans and reconcile accounts.
  
 18.)  VistA shall provide enhanced reporting capability, usability
 features, and additional data elements for managing healthcare debts
 referred for debt collection to improve VHA's ability to provide support
 to Veterans and manage accounts.
  
 19.)  Create report to track stop/reactivate debts. VistA shall provide
 a Stop/Reactivate report to identify healthcare debts that are placed
 in the corresponding status.
  
 20.)  Improve automation in management of debt collection. VistA shall
 utilize existing functionality, such as List Manager, and other
 automation capabilities to improve debt collection management.
  
 21.)  The existing Medication Co-Pay Exemption Report [PRCAX CO-PAY
 EXEMPTION REPORT] shall be modified with the following field changes:
        Change PT ID from full Social Security Number (SSN) to LastN +
              4SSN
        Add Rx#
        Add Drug Name (first 10 to 12 characters)
        Add Fill/Refill Date
        Add Effective Date of Exemption
  
 22.)  A new Third Party Accounts Receivable category called
 'EMERGENCY/HUMANITARIAN REIMB.' shall be created in Accounts Receivables
 with the insurer as the responsible party.
  
 23.) A new Third Party Accounts Receivable category called 'INELIGIBLE
 HOSP. REIMB.' shall be created in Accounts Receivables with the insurer
 as the responsible party.
  
 24.) A one-character "Type" field shall be added to the Claims Matching
 Report that will indicate the third-party claim care-type ("I" for
 Inpatient, "O" for Outpatient, "P" for Prosthetics, and "R" for 
 Prescription [Rx]) on the report of third-party bills.
  
 25.) When a user generates a Claims Matching Report for a patient, all
 records for that patient are currently produced on the report. At
 times, users need to generate information regarding only certain types
 of care for a patient.  The system shall allow the user to choose between
 producing a Claims Matching Report containing (1) all records for a
 patient, or (2) only records of a certain care type ("I" for Inpatient,
 "O" for Outpatient, "P" for Prosthetics, or "R" for Prescription [Rx]).
  
 26.) The Claims Matching Report, when exported, shall be in a line
 format so that information on the report may be easily exported to
 Microsoft Excel.
