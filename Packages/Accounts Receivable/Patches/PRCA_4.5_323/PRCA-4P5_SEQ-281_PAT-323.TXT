Subject: FIX REJECT TRANSMISSION HANDLING

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issue:
  
 1) Reject transmission processing:  Clear CS flag for '3E' reject code, 
    absolute value check that is causing reject batches being tossed 
    aside and adding new reject reasons to the TCS IAI ERROR CODES (#348.5)
    file.

                    flag from bill, entire reject batches are not
                    processing and new reject error codes used by Treasury.

 Ticket Overview:
 ================ 
 1) I12608411FY17 - 3E reject codes are not clearing the cross-service (CS)
                    flag from bill, entire reject batches are not
                    processing and new reject error codes used by Treasury.
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site reports that bills rejected by Treasury with 3E code are not 
 clearing the CS flag from bill. Also, entire reject transmissions from 
 Treasury are being rejected for unmatched total controls. Finally, 
 Treasury is using reject error codes not in the original TCS IAI ERROR 
 CODES (#348.5) file.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modification made to reject transmission handler to ensure 3E codes clear
 the CS flag from bill. Also, incorporated absolute total calculations to
 ensure entire batches are not cast aside due to negative amounts. Lastly,
 updated the TCS IAI ERROR CODES (#348.5) file with new reject error codes.
