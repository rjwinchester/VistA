  Remedy Ticket Overview:
  =======================
  INC0000000755859 - Accounts Receivable - Other:
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Site reported that they are having an issue with duplicate deposit ticket
  numbers after a Financial policy change now mandates the retention of 
  Deposit Ticket numbers for seven (7) years.
  
  solution:
  ---------
  Made changes to allow users to manually enter a seven (7) character 
  deposit number that is in the format of one (1) alpha character followed 
  by six (6) digits. This includes the TICKET # (#.01) field in AR DEPOSIT 
  (#344.1) file PRE-LOOKUP (LOOKUP^RCDPUDEP) and that field definition 
  itself. The update allows users to use a character prefix plus six (6) 
  digits for deposit ticket number when using the menu option Deposit 
  Processing [RCDP DEPOSIT PROCESSING].

   *** Special Important Information ***
   =====================================
   Once this patch is installed, an alpha prefix is required when entering 
   deposit ticket numbers in VistA. The alpha prefix added to the deposit
   ticket number allows recording of the correct 6-digit deposit ticket 
   number when you receive notification a deposit ticket number entered
   already exists. All sites must comply with the guidance below when
   recording deposit tickets in VistA:
  
   All transactions for any given deposit ticket number must be recorded 
   using the same alpha prefix.
  
   Alpha prefixes A through O are available for OTCnet deposits generated 
   by individual stations.
  
   Alpha prefixes P through X are available for OTCnet deposits generated 
   by and recorded by CPACs
  
   The Y prefix is reserved for credit card deposits generated by and 
   recorded by CPACs on behalf of other stations.
  
   The Z prefix is reserved for credit card deposits generated by and 
   recorded by the station.
  
   The below procedures explain how to create the 6-digit deposit ticket 
   number for recording credit card deposit:
  
   The first 2 digits              = 99
   The third digit                 = The current FISCAL year 
   The fourth through sixth digits = The Julian date of the deposit.
