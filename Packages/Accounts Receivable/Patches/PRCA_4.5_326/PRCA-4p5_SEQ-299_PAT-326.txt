============

 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this patch along 
 with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (PRCA) V. 4.5                     PRCA*4.5*326
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                        IB*2.0*609
  
 The patches (PRCA*4.5*326 and IB*2.0*609) are being released in the
 Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build 
 distribution as PRCA_IB_EPAYMENTS_BUNDLE_3_0.KID.
  
  
 The purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements of the Medical Care
 Collection Fund (MCCF) Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Transaction 
 Application Suite (TAS) Phase 1 project as related to Accounts Receivable
 (PRCA). This project ensures the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
 compliance with Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) and Electronic Remittance
 Advice (ERA) Operating Rules, and enables VA to more effectively use
 ERA data, resulting in better revenue and cash flow management. It will
 provide the infrastructure foundation for electronic exchange of claim
 payment information and promotes an interoperable system. It will reduce
 the time elapsed between receipt of the EDI 835 Electronic Remittance
 Advice Transaction and receipt of the Cash Concentration or Disbursement
 (CCD+) transactions. It will ensure that trace numbers between payments
 and remittances can be used by VA, reducing the level of open accounts
 receivable, allow claim denials to be more quickly addressed, and
 standardizes Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) & ERA enrollment to reduce
 workload burden on VA staff.
  
 This patch contains changes to the ePayments (835 and EFT) program area 
 to ensure compliance. Specifically, enhancements to the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Third Party
 EDI Lockbox module to increase timely and accurate processing of payments
 for electronic claims in compliance with Health Insurance Portability
 and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
 Fiscal Accounting policies. The ePayments system is used by Accounts
 Receivable (AR) staff to process payments from third party payers for
 both medical and pharmacy claims. 
  
 Notice:
   New Integration Agreement (IA) #6851 is used by Integrated billing to 
   get the FMS Status from ePayments.
  
  
  
 The following features of the PRCA software will be affected by this 
 patch.
  
 1.  Unique Electronic Transfer Funds (EFT) Identifiers
     Prior to this patch all detail lines belonging to an EFT were 
     displayed using the same EFT number.  Following this patch, each EFT
     detail line will be displayed with a unique identifier consisting of
     the EFT number, followed by a period and the sequence number of the
     EFT detail line.  The following reports and worklists will show the
     unique EFT identifier:    
     a) EFT Daily Activity Report           [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX ACT REPORT]

     a) The filter will now show results when a user elects to include 
        only pharmacy exceptions.
     b) The pharmacy flag allocated to a payer via the 'Identify payers' 
        option [RCDPE PAYER IDENTIFY] will be used to determine which

        with zero-dollar claim lines that are reversals.
     e) A new prompt 'AUTO-DECREASE NO-PAY MEDICAL CLAIMS FOR THE 
        FOLLOWING CARC/AMOUNTS ONLY:' was added to allow the site to

        Resolution (APAR) Worklist, the same way it currently works on
        payments that are not on the APAR worklist.

        or in the ERA Worklist, a warning message will be given if the user
        selects pharmacy or Tricare and there are no payers flagged
        as that type in the identify payers option.
     g) The AR Nightly process was changed to detect if new Payer 
        Name/TINs are detecting in incoming EFTs. If found, these Payers
        will be added to the exclusion file (#344.6) and can then be
        flagged in the Identify Payers [RCDPE PAYER IDENTIFY] OPTION.
