 This patch is part of an enhancement effort related to the Medical Care 
 Cost Recovery National Database (MCCR NDB) Treasury reports and new 
 requirements related to The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act 
 (DATA Act). This patch enhances the software component in each Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) system 
 that compiles and transmits the needed information to FMS to capture 
 current receivable attributes at time of transmission. This information 
 is sent in summary form to the central server on a monthly basis.
   
 This patch provides the following enhancements:
  
 (1) When the monthly AR1 data report is running, detail of the FMS 
     documents will be stored in the new AR DEBT COLLECTOR (#430.7) file.
  
 (2) When the OIG collector is running through the same monthly cycle, 
     detail of the receivables if not already stored in the new AR DEBT 
     COLLECTOR (#430.7) will also be stored if their status is Active or 
     Suspended.
  
 (3) A new report option ARDC Monthly Reconciliation [PRCA ARDC MONTHLY 
     REPORT] will be added to both the AR - Accounts Receivable Menu [PRCAT
     USER] and the Reconciliation Reports [PRCAD RECONCILE MENU] menus.
  
     o The report shall include current status bills.
   
     o The report shall include a column for the Fund number associated
       with each line item on the report.
   
     o The report shall include a column for the Revenue Source Code (RSC) 
       associated with each line item on the report.
  
     o The report will offer an option to print in Excel format.  It will 
       use the ^ character as a field separator.
  
 (4) The collection of historical ARDC data will be retained for the 
     current month and two prior months only.  After that it will be 
     automatically purged once the next AR accounting month starts
     processing,
  
   
 The existing ARDC Detail Report [PRCA ARDC REPORT] is being updated to 
 resolve the following issues:
  
 (1) Issue: During UFT testing it was found that the report included bills
            that were a day before the requested date.
     Resolution: A modification to RCRJRCOU is included to no longer
                 subtract 1 day from the beginning search of bills.  It
                 will now start on the requested bill date.
  
 (2) Issue: It was found on an SQA checklist that some variables were not 
            Newed or Killed.
     Resolution: Added Newing of the variables RCSTDT and RCBILL.
  
  
 The patch has a shortened timeframe (*7 days*) for installation due to 
 the strict timing required (in between reporting cycles) for patch 
 installation. There is a small window of time for all sites to install 
 the patch.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 A pre-installation routine (PRCAP335) will run upon patch installation to 
 check the site does not have an old file #430.7 from Accounts Receivable 
 version 3.7.  If the old, no longer used file, exists it will be 
 automatically removed prior to installation.
  
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation of 
 development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision between development
 team, VA site/region personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
   
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should have
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of
 install). The message containing the backed up routines can be loaded with
 the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman
 function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed up
 routines onto the VistA System. 
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ---------------------------
 This patch may be run with users on the system, but not when the Accounts
 Receivable Background job is running (usually around 1AM).  Installation 
 should take less than 5 minutes.
   
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
    
  2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
    
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
      following option. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch #
      (example: PRCA*4.5*335):
    
     a.  Print Transport Global - This option lets you print the contents
         of a Transport Global that is currently loaded in the ^XTMP
         global.
     b.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     d.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
        
  4.  INSTALL THE PATCH:
