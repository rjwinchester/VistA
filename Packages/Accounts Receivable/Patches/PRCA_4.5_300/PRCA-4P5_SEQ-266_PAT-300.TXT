  Overview of the Remedy Ticket:
  ------------------------------
  AR staff is trying to put several bills into VISTA with only SIX digits.
  When they go into the option Select Audit/Setup a New Accounts Receivable
  this happens:
  
  Select Audit/Set up a New Accounts Receivable Option: ?
  
           Audit an Electronic Bill
           Set up and Audit New Accounts Receivable
           Amended Bill Audit
           Edit an Incomplete Accounts Receivable
  
  Select Audit/Set up a New Accounts Receivable Option: SET up and Audit
  New Accounts Receivable
  SITE: LEXINGTON-CDD VAMC//     KY  VAMC      596A4
  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BILL NO. : 0000K0000
  
  Please enter 7 character bill number.
  It must be in the following format: K400001, K481234 or '(N)ew' to get
  the next available number.  (Enter "^" to exit)
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Corrected the INPUT TRANSFORM for the Bill No. field (.01) in the
  Accounts Receivable file (#430).  Changed the code so that it would
  accept both 6-character and 7-character Bill Numbers.  Also changed
  the HELP and DESCRIPTION for this field to reflect the correct
  messages describing what would be allowed as input for the Bill No.
