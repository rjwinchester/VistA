============

 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this patch along 
 with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (PRCA) V. 4.5                    PRCA*4.5*321
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                         IB*2.0*596
  
 The patches (PRCA*4.5*321 and IB*2.0*596) are being released in the
 Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build 
 distribution as PRCA_IB_EPAYMENTS_BUNDLE_2_0.KID.
  
  
 The purpose of this patch is to meet the requirements of the Medical Care
 Collection Fund (MCCF) Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Transaction 
 Application Suite (TAS) Phase 1 project as related to Accounts Receivable
 (PRCA). This project ensures the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
 compliance with Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) and Electronic Remittance
 Advice (ERA) Operating Rules, and enables VA to more effectively use
 ERA data, resulting in better revenue and cash flow management. It will
 provide the infrastructure foundation for electronic exchange of claim
 payment information and promotes an interoperable system. It will
 reduce the time elapsed between receipt of the EDI 835 Electronic
 Remittance Advice Transaction and receipt of the Cash Concentration or
 Disbursement (CCD+) transactions. It will ensure that trace numbers
 between payments and remittances can be used by VA, reducing the level of
 open accounts receivable, allow claim denials to be more quickly
 addressed, and standardizes Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) & ERA
 enrollment to reduce workload burden on VA staff.
  
 This patch contains changes to the ePayments (835 and EFT) program area 
 to ensure compliance. Specifically, enhancements to the Veterans 
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Third Party
 EDI Lockbox module to increase timely and accurate processing of payments
 for electronic claims in compliance with Health Insurance Portability
 and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
 Fiscal Accounting policies. The ePayments system is used by Accounts
 Receivable (AR) staff to process payments from third party payers for
 both medical and pharmacy claims. 
  
 Notice:
   Integration Agreement (IA) #6814 is used by the post-install routine 
   ^RCP321 for access to ^XMB(3.8 to allow deletion of any REMOTE MEMBER
   containing text of VHA835NOTIFY (upper or lower case) from the existing
   mail group RCDPE AUDIT.
  
   IA #2992 is used by the post-install routine ^RCP321 to convert the 
   default for ERA_CLAIM_TYPE in worklist from "B" to "A".
  
  
 The following features of the PRCA software will be affected by this 
 patch.
  
 1. Daily Activity Report Enhancements [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX ACT REPORT]
    
    a) The Matched Payment amount posted line was removed from the daily 
       and final totals.
    b) The report header will display selected Division numbers instead of
       selected division names.
    c) In detail mode, the report will page break on each daily total, on 
       the final total and when an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) deposit
       cannot be fully displayed on the page.
    d) The report will no longer be sent via email to the mail group RCDPE
       PAYMENTS as part of the nightly process.
    e) A new filter was added to allow the user to only select EFTs with
       debit vouchers.
    f) A new debit column was added to the report to indicate which EFTs 
       have debit vouchers.
    g) The daily and final totals will now display the number of EFTs with
       debit vouchers and the total amount of those EFTs.
  
 2. Receipt Comment History
    a) A comment is now required when a clerk puts funds into suspense. 
       The following areas are affected:
        - ERA Worklist [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST] Scratchpad
          Split/Edit action
        - Auto-Post Awaiting Resolution [RCDPE APAR] (APAR Worklist)
          Scratchpad Split/Edit action
        - Link Payment to Account [RCDP LINK PAYMENT TO ACCOUNT] worklist
          in the LP and CS actions
    b) The Clerk will have the option of selecting a 'standard' comment 
       from a predefined list, or entering a free text comment that is at
       least 3 characters long.
    c) The user who entered the comment and the date/time it was entered
       will now be captured by the system.
    d) When the comment is displayed in the ERA Worklist Scratchpad or
       the APAR scratchpad, the system will now also display the user
       who entered the comment and the date/time it was entered.
    e) A new file was created, RCDPE COMMENT HISTORY (#344.78) which will
       contain the complete history of suspense related comments for 
       receipts.
    f) The entire comment history will be displayed in the Summary SF215
       Report [RCDP SUMMARY 215 REPORT] when this report is run in detail
       mode.
    g) The entire comment history will also be displayed in the Link 
       Payment Tracking Report [RCDPE SUSPENSE AUDIT REPORT].
    h) Any receipt that is purged as part of the nightly process will also
       have its comment history in the RCDPE COMMENT HISTORY file (#344.78)
       purged at the same time.
  
 3. Corrections to the EFT Transaction Audit Report
    [RCDPE EFT TRANSACTION AUD REP]
  
    The software has been modified to fix a bug when old cash receipts (CR)
    are used in calculations for the report.
  
 4. Corrected EEOB Attachment to Claims
  
    The software has been modified such that ERA Worklist and APAR will 
    automatically move an Electronic Explanation of Benefits (EEOB)
    when a line is split/edited when possible. The automatic moving of
    an EEOB will follow the same rules as the existing EEOB 
    Move/Copy/Remove [RCDPE EEOB MOVE/COPY/REMOVE] menu option.
  
    The automatic update will occur at receipt creation in the PRCA nightly
    autopost job (for APAR changes) or at receipt creation for the ERA
    Worklist.
  
    Details of the move/copy/delete transactions and justification text 
    may be viewed in the EEOB Move/Copy/Remove Audit Report
    [RCDPE EEOB MOVE/COPY/RMOVE RPT] option and are also displayed in
    Third Party Joint Inquiry [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY] (TPJI) within
    the action Account Profile followed by the action Comment History.
  
 5. EFT edits in Receipt Processing [RCDP RECEIPT PROCESSING]
    
    The software was modified such that:
  
    a) Users who have the RCDPEPP security key may change the TYPE OF
       PAYMENT from CHECK/MO PAYMENT to EDI LOCKBOX on receipts that have
       pre-existing lines and allow the clerk to add/attach a new EFT to
       the receipt.
    b) Users who have the RCDPEPP security key may change the EFT number
       on receipts when the TYPE OF PAYMENT equals 'EDI LOCKBOX'.
    c) When the EFT number is changed on receipts with TYPE OR PAYMENT 
       equals EDI LOCKBOX, the EFT that was removed is unmatched and
       appears on the EFT Unmatched Aging report so it can be matched to a
       new ERA.
    d) The header of the Receipt Processing worklist was enhanced to
       include the display of the ERA number, ERA total, EFT number and the
       EFT Total associated with the deposit when appropriate.
    e) Two additional prompts were added to the On-Line Entry action. The 
       user will now be asked to confirm the EFT funds have been entered
       into the 8NZZ account and will also be asked to enter the FMS
       Reference Number (#344, 200).
  
 6. Payer Name Display and Selection issues when the Payer Name is greater 
    than 30 characters.
  
    a) The 835 CARC Data Report [RCDPE CARC CODE PAYER REPORT] now allows 
       payers with names that are longer than 30 characters to be selected
       and displayed on the report.
    b) The EFT/ERA Trending Report [RCDPE EFT-ERA TRENDING REPORT] now 
       allows payers with names that are longer than 30 characters to be
       selected and displayed on the report.
    c) The Provider Level Adjustments Report [RCDPE PROVIDER LVL ADJ 
       REPORT] now allows payers with names that are longer than 30
       characters to be selected and displayed on the report.
    d) The ERA Unmatched Aging Report [RCDPE ERA AGING REPORT] now allows 
       payers with names that are longer than 30 characters to be selected
       and displayed on the report.
  
 7. Move EEOBs to Claims with Payments linked from Suspense
    
    The Link Payment option will be modified such that:
    a) When the user enters the associated Electronic Remittance Advice 
       (ERA), the system will automatically find the associated EEOB and
       prompt the user to attach it to the claim.
    b) Only Posted EEOBs will be displayed to allow the user to attach it 
       to the claim.
    c) When prompting the user to attach a posted EEOB to the claim, the 
       system will display the Trace Number, Total Amount Paid, Removed By
       user and the Justification comment.
    d) All restored EEOBs will appear on the EEOB Move/Copy/Remove Audit 
       Report [RCDPE EEOB MOVE/COPY/RMOVE RPT].
  
 8. The menu option Move ERA Total to Suspense [RCDPE MOVE ERA TO 
    SUSPENSE] was removed from the system.
  
 9. When manually creating a new receipt, help text was added to the 
    'PATIENT NAME OR BILL NUMBER' prompt.
  
 10. The Refresh Scratch Pad action was removed from the APAR Worklist.
  
 11. Added Sort options to the Auto-Post Awaiting Resolution (APAR)
     [RCDPE APAR].
     a) Added the ability to sort the APAR worklist by Date Created,
        Payer Name, APAR Reason, Posted Amount and Unposted Amounts.
        If the user selects to sort by Date Created, they are then
        prompted to display the ERAs in Ascending or Descending Date
        Created Order. If they select to sort by Posted or Unposted
        Amounts, they are then prompted to display the ERAs in 
        highest to lowest or lowest to highest order.
     b) Added a column to the body of the worklist to display the
        Date Created of the ERA. Note that this column is past the 80
        character screen margin width so the user will have to use the
        right arrow key to scroll the display to see the Date Created
        values.
  
 12. EDI Lockbox 3rd Party Exceptions [RCDPE EXCEPTION PROCESSING]
     a) If a pharmacy claim had an ECME rejected claim line followed by a 
        data exception on a subsequent claim line, the display of the claim
        line data was incorrect.  This was fixed such that the correct
        claim line data is displayed for the claim.
  
 13. Default Service Date from the Start Date when creating ERAs for
     Pharmacy claims with no specified Service Date.
     a) ERAs are created during the nightly ePayments process. The
        service date will now automatically default from the start
        date when an ERA is created for a pharmacy claim with no
        specified service date.
  
 14. New Identify Payers [RCDPE PAYER IDENTIFY] option added to the
     EDI LOCKBOX (EPAYMENTS) [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX MENU] ePayments menu.
      a) The Identify Payers menu option was added as the last displayed
         option on the EDI LOCKBOX (EPAYMENTS) ePayments menu.
      b) This new option displays a worklist that allows users to identify
         payers in the RCDPE AUTO-PAY EXCLUSION file (#344.6) as Pharmacy
         and/or Tricare Payers. Two new fields PHARMACY PAYER (#344.6, .09)
         and TRICARE PAYER (#344.6, .1) were added to the file for this
         purpose. All users with access to the Identify Payers menu option
         will be able to view and edit the current payer settings.
      c) Identifying payers as Pharmacy and/or Tricare payers will enable
         future sorting/filtering enhancements for Pharmacy and Tricare
         payers.
  
 15. New AR SITE PARAMETER settings for auto-auditing EDI medical and
     Pharmacy claims.
      a) Prior to this enhancement, only paper medical and pharmacy 
         claims could be auto-audited.
      b) Two new fields AUTO-AUDIT MEDICAL EDI BILLS (#341, 7.07) and
         AUTO-AUDIT RX EDI BILLS (#341, 7.08) were added for the purpose of
         auto-auditing.
      c) The new site parameter settings are maintained through the
         EDI Lockbox Parameters [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX PARAMETERS] menu option.
      d) Changes were made to the ePayments auto-audit nightly process to
         auto-audit EDI medical and pharmacy claims based upon the new
         values of these two new fields.
      e) These new site parameter fields have also been added to the EDI
         Lockbox Parameters Report [RCDPE SITE PARAMETER REPORT].
  
 16. Change to the maximum allowed values of two EDI Lockbox Parameters 
     [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX PARAMETERS] options.
      a) The maximum allowed value of the Number of Days (AGE) of 
         Unposted Medical EFTs to Prevent Posting (#344.61, .06) was
         changed to allow a maximum of 60 days instead of 99.
      b) The maximum allowed value of the Number of Days (AGE) of Unposted
         Pharmacy EFTs to Prevent Posting (#344.61, .07) was changed to
         allow a maximum of 365 days instead of 999.
  
 17. Auto-Posting of manually matched ERAs/EFTs in the ePayments nightly
     auto-posting process.
      a) Prior to this enhancement, ERAs and EFTs that were manually
         matched would auto-post during the nightly process. Only ERAs
         with a payment type of ACH were auto-post candidates. Now ERAs
         with a payment type of CHK are also auto-post candidates.
      b) The manual match action on the ERA Worklist [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX 
         WORKLIST] and the Manual Match EFT-ERA menu option [RCDPE MANUAL
         MATCH EFT-ERA] were enhanced to allow ERAs with a payment type of
         CHK to be marked for auto-post.
      c) Unbalanced ERAs that were manually marked for auto post will not 
         auto post. These can be found on the ERA Worklist for user action.
  
 18. Prevent manual and auto-auditing of any claims that have billing 
     rejects on the Claim Status Awaiting Resolution Worklist (CSA)
     [IBCE CLAIMS STATUS AWAITING]
      a) Any claims that have billing rejects on the CSA will not be
         audited in the nightly auto-auditing process.
      b) Users will also be prevented from manually auditing any claims
         that have billing rejects on the CSA using the Audit Setup New
         Accounts Receivable [PRCA SET/AUDIT NEW BILL].
  
 19. Add new filters, sort and worklist option to the List of Receipts 
     Report [RCDP LIST OF RECEIPTS REPORT].
      a) Added the ability to sort the Lists of Receipt Report by Date
         Opened, FMS Status or Type of Payment.
      b) Added the ability to filter the report by FMS Status. If the
         user chooses to filter by FMS Status, they will be prompted to
         enter the FMS Status(es) to display on the report.
      c) Added the ability to filter the report by Payment Type. If the
         user chooses to filter by Payment Type, they will be prompted to
         enter the Payment Type(s) to display on the report.
      d) Added the option to display the report in a worklist that allows
         the user to select a receipt and perform the Process Receipt
         [RCDP RECEIPT PROCESSING] action.
      e) Added a new cross-reference to the AR BATCH PAYMENT file (#344).
         on the DATE OPENED field (#344. 03) so that receipts can be
         retrieved for a selected date range and greatly increase the
         performance of the report.
  
 20. New filters added to the ERA Worklist [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST].
      a) A new filter was added to ERA Worklist to filter ERAs by 
         Zero Dollar, Payment or both. If the user selects the Zero
         Dollar filter, only ERAs with a TOTAL AMOUNT PAID (#344.4, .05)
         of zero will be displayed. If the user selects the Payment 
         filter, all ERAs with a TOTAL AMOUNT PAID of zero will be skipped.
      b) The current filter of Medical, Pharmacy or Both was amended to
         Medical, Pharmacy, Tricare or All. If the Tricare filter is
         selected, only ERAs with a payer flagged as Tricare in the
         RCDPE AUTO-PAY EXCLUSION file (#344.6) will be displayed.
  
 21. Allow ERAs matched to an EFT with a receipt status of ON-LINE to be
     auto-posted and/or processed in the ERA Worklist [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX
     WORKLIST].
      a) Prior to this enhancement, the ePayments nightly auto-post
         process would skip any ERAs that were matched to an EFT with a
         receipt status of ON-LINE. These ERAs will now auto-post.
      b) Prior to this enhancement the Receipt Processing action on the
         Worklist scratch pad was disabled for ERAs that were matched to
         an EFT with a receipt status of ON-LINE. The user will now be 
         able to access the Receipt Processing action.
  
 22. Issues with processing of Pharmacy claims by the nightly process were 
     corrected.
      a) Caremark claims with valid ECME numbers of 8 characters in length 
         or more were being transformed into format nnn-nnnnn.. prior to 
         using ECME number to match the incoming claim to a VistA bill. 
         This prevented matching and caused a large number of 
         ERA lines to be marked as exceptions. The transform has been 
         removed for pharmacy claims only and the unmodified ECME number
         will now be used for matching to bills.
      b) The nightly process which cleared exceptions for recently released
         prescriptions, was not picking up a date for use in ECME to bill 
         matching. The matching was being performed without a date. This
         has been corrected.
