Subject: CONVERT TCSP CORRECTION SCRIPTS TO USER OPTION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 Convert all scripts for handling Treasury Cross Service Project (TCSP)
 exceptions between Vista and Treasury to user option with improved
 controls. These scripts were provided to sites by the TCSP developers
 to handle mismatched Vista debtor/bills with the Treasury status for
 the same debtor/bills. 
             
 The sites are currently running these unwieldly scripts that need IT
 intervention to execute in programmer mode.

 Problem Overview:
 ================= 
 Replace TCSP scripts for scrubbing bill inconsistencies.
  
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The sites are running Class III scripts that need IT intervention to 
 correct Treasury Cross Service bills incorrectly flagged when 
 compared to the Treasury data or on the monthly reconciliation 
 report from Treasury. 
  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A new option, TCSP Flag Control [RCDP TCSP FLAG CONTROL], was created
 to correct debtor/bill for Treasury Cross Service as seen when viewing the
 same debtor/bill on the Treasury System or from the monthly TCSP
 reconciliation report. The patch affects debtor/bill in file ACCOUNTS
 RECEIVABLE (#430). A new security key, RCDP TCSP FLAG, was also created to
 allow users that are assigned to edit the TCSP flag on Debtor and/or 
 Bill. This Security Key, RCDP TCSP FLAG, should ONLY be allocated by CPAC 
 IT and given ONLY to Veteran Services Supervisors and/or Veteran Services 
 Leads (One, Two or Three).
