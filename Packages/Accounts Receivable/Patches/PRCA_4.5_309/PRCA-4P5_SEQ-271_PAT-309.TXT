 2. I6653962FY16 'Brief Comment' not auto generated for the additional
    suspension types
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A test site user found a bill being suspended with the suspension type of
 'ADMINISTRATIVE SUSPENSION' during the testing on the first issue, but
 then the 'Brief Comment' automatically generated for the suspension type
 of 'APPEAL FOR CO-PAY WAIVER' in the Brief Account Profile [PRCAY
 ACCOUNT PROFILE] option.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A new function with the suspension types is added to routine RCWROFF. It
 will automatically set up the selective suspension type in the 'Brief
 Comment' field (#5.02) of the AR Transaction file (#433) for the Brief
 Account Profile option.
