 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:

 1. I17494417FY18 - Issue with printing 21 day certificates in CAPRI GUI
   
     Problem:
     --------
     CAPRI report 21 Day Certificate Printing does not properly display 
     certificates in the CAPRI GUI, and displays the message "No data found
     for requested report criteria". The report does run successfully and
     modifies the correct fields in the record, but the certificate is not
     being displayed in the CAPRI GUI.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified routine DVBACRMS to check for the variable DVBGUI before 
     changing the value of the variable IO. The CAPRI GUI sets DVBGUI to 1.
  
  2. I14941635FY17 - CAPRI's 21 Day Certificate Printing report is not
                     printing automatically
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Currently, 21 day certificates must be released manually through the
     MAS Edit/Release of 21-day Certificates [DVBA RELEASE 21-DAY CERT] 
     option before they can be printed by the Regional Office (RO). There
     is a request to automate this process.
  
     There is also a defect in the background routine DVBACERT that will
     prevent new 21 day certificate requests from being generated.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified the background routine DVBACERT to automate the release of
     21 day certificates. The release process will occur in the background
     job that creates the certificates. This will make certificates
     immediately available for printing by the RO once they are created.
  
     Modified DVBACERT to not include seconds in the date comparison 
     between the admission date on the 21 day certificate request and the
     admission date from the PATIENT MOVEMENT (#405) file.
