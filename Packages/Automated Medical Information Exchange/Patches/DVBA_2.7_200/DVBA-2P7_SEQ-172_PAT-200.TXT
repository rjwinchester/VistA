Description:
============

 This patch addresses 3 issues:

    Record Interchange) to display the report date rather than the date 
    the report was run.
  
 2. Fixes several incorrect uses of the TEMP global.
  
 3. Fixes formatting issues with the 7131 Requests Report.

 OVERVIEW:
 =========
 1. I7344966FY16   CAPRI "re-print C&P final reports" option 
                   displays run date instead of date report is for  
   
    Problem: 
    --------
    When running the "Re-Print C&P Final Report(s)" the report displays
    the date the report was run instead of the date the report was
    run for.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    While building the report header it will now use the specified
    "Report Date" to display in CAPRI.
  
    Routine(s):DVBCRPR1
  
  
 2. I11328396FY17    Not cleaning up ^TMP in AMIE/DVBC when 
                     printing/using C&P Exams 
   
    Problem: 
    --------
    The process to retrieve active cancelation reasons utilizes the
    ^TMP( global to store results, but does not properly clean it
    up after the data is returned. 
  
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine DVBCANRS will be modified to cleanup (Kill) the temp global
    after the processing has completed.
  
    Routine(s):DVBCANRS
  
 3. I14558309FY17    Issues with CSV export of CAPRI pending 
                     7131 requests report
    
    Problem: 
    --------
    While running the "Pending Form 7131 Requests" report in CAPRI, the
    user has the ability to format it in as a "CSV Comma Delimited Export"
    file.  However, if a Medical Center Division file (#40.8) record
    contains a comma, the report code does not parse it correctly and 
    the data is not formatted correctly.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The code to compile the report will now take in to account the
    possibility of fields using the Medical Center Division file (#40.8)
    containing commas and adjust the returned data accordingly.
