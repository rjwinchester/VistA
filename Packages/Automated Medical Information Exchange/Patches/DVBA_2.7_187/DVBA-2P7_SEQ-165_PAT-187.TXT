 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
   
    The following is an overview of the changes and primary
    functionality that will be delivered in CAPRI GUI v187 and this
    VistA patch (DVBA*2.7*187).
     
     1. The following enhancements that were requested by Veterans Health
        Administration Veterans Affairs Central Office (VHAVACO) are being
        addressed:
   
      a.  CAPRI users need to be able to select "DBQ Medical SHA" as an 
          exam type.
  
  
          A new entry is being added to the AMIE EXAM file (#396.6). 
          The new entry will have an IEN of 463.  The TITLE will be
          "DBQ Medical SHA". 
  
  
  
      b.  CAPRI has been modified to contain a new security key of 
          "DVBA CAPRI GETDOCSFROMVLER", which will allow access to the 
          new menu option "Get Docs from DAS" under the CAPRI File
          menu. Any user that requires access to this menu must be
          assigned this key.  If this key is not assigned to a user,
          the File menu will not be displayed. 
  
  
  
  
      c.  For CAPRI users that once had the security key "DVBA
          CAPRI DENY_GETVBADOCS" applied to their user accounts, to
          deny access to the "Get Docs from Virtual VA" functionality,
          the business now requires the security key to be replaced.
          The new security key DVBA CAPRI GETVBADOCS will be added to
          CAPRI. The old key denied access, the new one grants access.
          Only current non-terminated users will get the new key.
          Note: The person installing this patch must hold the  XUMGR
          security key. 
  
      d.  When DAS receives the exam result from the provider, it 
          stores a notification in its database. CAPRI will query for a 
          Manifest Available notification and using that 
          notification, query for Exam Result Available notifications 
          which provide links to the exam results themselves.
  
      e.  For each 2507 exam request, one or more exam results are
          requested. In some cases, additional exams are performed in the
          course of the examination.  The VBA reviewer is alerted when
          all exam results from a provider have been completed and
          submitted to DAS. After the exam results have been 
          submitted, the provider is required to submit a manifest list
          of all exam results that have been generated in response to an
          exam request. When that manifest is submitted to DAS, 
          DAS stores a Manifest available notification in its 
          database.  CAPRI will query DAS for any Manifest available
          notifications available for a given station and display a list
          of  patients / exam results available to the reviewer.
  
  
      f.  When an examiner signs and completes multiple templates that 
          have been merged together, CAPRI separates the current merged/
          concatenated exam report back into single exams for the purpose
          of PDF file creation.
  
      g.  DBQ Transmission Failure.  If a DBQ transmission to DAS fails,
          CAPRI displays a message indicating a transmission failure.  
          CAPRI now provides users one opportunity to retransmit the failed
          transmission. Since exam data is stored in VVA and VistA, CAPRI 
          does not store the failed transmission and users can locate the
          data from either system. 
  
  
      h.  A new menu option has been created under the File Menu:  Get 
          Docs from DAS.  This function retrieves available exam
          results based on user input.  Once the list of exams is
          displayed, the user can select a specific exam and display 
          the results.
  
      i.  VHA users may assign one or many exams to a vendor.  CAPRI will 
          notify DAS that a new 2507 Exam Request for a vendor has 
          been submitted.  
                                
      j.  CAPRI will retrieve vendor exam results that have a status of
          Pending-Under Review.  A VHA examiner will review these exams and
          either mark them complete or reject them and send them back to
          the vendor for more information.
  
      k.  One entry in the AMIE EXAM file (#396.6) has been renamed
          to conform with new names determined DBQ Governance Group.
          DBQ Medical Opinion 1 has been renamed to DBQ Medical Opinion.
  
      l.  The following entries in the AMIE EXAM file (#396.6) have been 
          inactivated:  
  
          Entry Number    EXAM NAME
          438             DBQ Medical Opinion 2
          439             DBQ Medical Opinion 3
          440             DBQ Medical Opinion 4
          441             DBQ Medical Opinion 5
          433             DBQ CARDIO Ischemic heart disease
          416             DBQ MUSC Flatfoot (pes planus)
  
          The current version of the DBQ Medical Opinion allows for input
          of multiple Medical Opinions, so that multiple DBQ Medical 
          Opinion selections are no longer necessary.
  
  
    2. The following Remedy tickets are being addressed:
  
      a.  INC000000998063 - CAPRI - Other: Transmit to Virtual VA bug 
                
          Problem
          -------
          After a user selects "Transmit to Virtual VA", after the 
          attempt is complete, the status caption indicates the 
          application is in a "Sending state."
    
          Solution
          --------
          After the Virtual VA transmission attempt is complete, the 
          status caption will be reset to "Ready". 
  
  
      b.  INC000000970009 - CAPRI - Wrong exam comments on 2507 screen    
  
          Problem
          -------
          When adding a 2507 Exam request the "Routing Location 
          Information" will be populated with the COMMENT FOR GUI (#3) 
          from the CAPRI DIVISION EXAM LIST file (#396.15) record with 
          the largest DIVISION (.01) value - pointer to Medical Center 
          Division file (#40.8).
  
  
          Solution
          --------
          Prior to displaying the form to add a 2507 Exam request, the 
          "Routing Location Information" will be set to null until a
          "Routing Location" is selected.
  
  
      c.  INC000000938270 - CAPRI - Other:    
  
          Problem
          -------
          When sending email notifications triggered by events in 
          CAPRI the process assumes the "Requestor" has an EMAIL 
          ADDRESS (#.151) in the NEW PERSON file (#200) but if the value 
          does not exist a subscript error occurs.
  
  
          Solution
          --------
          Prior to sending an email notification the process will verify 
          the "Requestor" has an EMAIL ADDRESS (#.151).  If not, the 
          notification attempt will not proceed.
  
  
      d.  INC000000959449 - CAPRI - Authorized Patient:    
  
          Problem
          -------
          If a user accesses a template/worksheet via the "My Unsigned 
          C&P Worksheets" option, the patient info is different than 
          what is displayed and stored on the main screen so when the 
          print functionality is utilized it pulls the data from the 
          main screen rather than the newly opened template/worksheet 
          and populates the footer with the wrong patient data.
  
  
          Solution
          --------
          If the print functionality is triggered from within the
          worksheet module the patient info will be pulled from the
          template header rather than from the main form.
          
          
      e.  INC000000919417 - ONEEMAIL+15^DVBAB1A    
          
          Problem
          -------
          While in a 2507 Request, if a user (other than the initial 
          requestor) edits the request,  the "Requestor" value will reflect
          the name of the user who edited the request and not the user who 
          submitted the initial 2507 Request.
  
  
          Solution
          --------
          Modify the code so that the user editing the request is no longer
          being passed to Vista to be updated as the new "Requestor".
  
  
      f.  INC000000819092 - CAPRI News Items not saving read/clear
          status    
  
          Problem
          -------
          When determining if a user has read the "news items", the code 
          looks for the existence of the CAPRINewsReadInfo.txt file in the 
          users' "Temp" directory, but with the migration to Windows 7, it 
          is VA policy that this directory be purged upon every restart 
          therefore the flag/file is removed after every restart.
  
  
          Solution
          --------
          The function to set the users' "Temp" directory in CAPRI
          currently identifies a location that is typically purged upon 
          restart.  The function has been modified to first attempt to
          create a CAPRI specific directory that is not purged and
          identify that as the "Temp" directory. 
         
  
  
  
      g.  INC000001005379 - CAPRI - Other: new patient entry fails if 
                            space at end   
  
          Problem
          -------
          While entering a new patient through CAPRI, if either the first
          or last name contain leading or trailing spaces an error will 
          occur while trying to lookup existing potential matches.       
  
  
          Solution
          --------
          Prior to searching for potential matches, the leading and
          trailing spaces will be removed.
  
  
    3. The following defects that were reported directly to the CAPRI
       development team are being addressed:
  
        a. Modify CAPRI to change ALL references to location of
           Temporary Files from the standard TEMP folder. 
  
          Problem
          -------
          Throughout CAPRI there are several files that are saved
          locally to the users' workstation.  Due to a new security 
          policy added with Windows 7, the TEMP folder currently
          identified by CAPRI is purged upon restart which causes
          problems with several files needed for historical purposes.
  
          Solution
          --------
          The function in CAPRI to define the users TEMP folder has
          been modified to attempt to create a "CAPRI" specific folder
          that will not be purged and save all documents (EX: CAPRI 
          Audit logs, Save History logs, Error logs, and template 
          files),  except the temporary VVA and VLER files.   
  
  
    4. Added/Modified Routines 
  
        a. Add: DVBA187P
           Description: This routine is the DVBA*2.7*187 post install
           routine.
           There are two sections:
              1) AMIE FILE UPDATE
              2) SECURITY KEY ASSIGNER 
  
        b. Modify: DVBAB1A
           Description: CAPRI Exam Complete Email Driver. Modified code
           to quit mail send if user does not have a mailbox setup.
           Note: This will prevent the ONEEMAIL+15^DVBAB1A error.

    b.  File #396.3, field 46 - REQUEST UUID has been added to store the
        2507 request's UUID (universally unique identifier) for VLER  DAS.
  
   
  
   1.  Added/Modified Routines 
        a. Add: DVBA187P
           Description: This routine is the DVBA*2.7*187 post install
                        routine. This routine has two sections.
            1) AMIE UPDATE
            Adds "DBQ Medical SHA"
            entry to AMIE EXAM file (#396.6).
  
            2) SECURITY KEY ASSIGNER
            Includes the new security key
            DVBA CAPRI GETVBADOCS and assigns persons to it. The
            person must have the DVBA CAPRI GUI option and
            must not have the old key.
            Only current non-terminated users will get the new key.
            NOTE: The user who installs this patch must have the
            XUMGR security key assigned to them.
            Messages will be created for users who should get the new
            key, and successful updates to the persons assigned the
            new key. This message is generated for the installer.
  
  
       b. Modified: DVBAB1A
           Description: CAPRI Exam Complete Email Driver. Modified code
                        to quit mail send if user does not have a mailbox
                        setup. This will resolve the ONEEMAIL+15^DVBAB1A
                        error.
     
  
   2. The following Security Keys are being added/modified to the
      SECURITY KEY File (#19.1):
  
      a. NAME: DVBA CAPRI GETDOCSFROMVLER
         DESCRIPTIVE NAME: Get VLER DAS documents
         PERSON LOOKUP: LOOKUP
         KEEP AT TERMINATE: YES 
         SEND TO J2EE: 
         DESCRIPTION:
         The key will allow users to run queries from VLER DAS.
  
  
  
      b. NAME: DVBA CAPRI GETVBADOCS
         DESCRIPTIVE NAME: VIEW GET DOCS FROM VIRTUAL VA
         PERSON LOOKUP: LOOKUP
         KEEP AT TERMINATE: YES
         SEND TO J2EE: 
         DESCRIPTION:
          DVBA CAPRI GETVBADOCS is a security key for CAPRI users to view
          the "Get Docs from Virtual VA" option in CAPRI
  
          A security key is being phased out called DVBA CAPRI DENY_
          GETVBADOCS. That key would deny a user from accessing 
          "Get Docs from Virtual VA" functionality. It has been decided
          to grant access to the "Get Docs from Virtual VA" 
          functionality rather than deny it. The new security key, 
          DVBA CAPRI GETVBADOCS, is now added to a user's security key
          options to grant access.
          Only current non-terminated users will get the new key.
  
          Note: The person installing this patch must hold the  XUMGR
          security key.
  
  
   3. The following entry is being added to the AMIE EXAM file (#396.6):
       
      a. DBQ Medical SHA
         
         The new entry will have an IEN of 463. It will not have a
         worksheet number. The REPORTING PROGRAM NAME for this new entry
         will be DVBCQDRV. The STATUS will be "ACTIVE". 
  
   4. The following files have been modified
      
      a. 396.45   2507 EXAM CONTRACTORS 
      b. 396.3    2507 REQUEST

 VII. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  
    NOTE: The user who installs this patch must have the XUMGR security
          key assigned to them.
  
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
    2. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select
       the Installation menu.
  
    3. From this menu, you may now elect to use the following options (when
       prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*187).
  
       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
          to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
          global.
       d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package DVBA*2.7*187.
  
    5. If prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
       Install? NO//', respond NO.
  
    6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       NO//', it is recommended you answer NO.
  
    7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
    8. If CAPRI GUI users have not already been upgraded to the new 
       version of the CAPRI GUI v187 (CAPRI.exe [DVBA_27_P187_12.zip]), 
       they MUST be upgraded immediately following the installation
       of this patch.
  
    9.  NOTE: Post-install routine DVBA187P is a temporary routine used
        as part of the post-install process. This routine will NOT be
        deleted after install so that it may catch issues during install.
        The message will be stored in the INSTALL file (#9.7).  To view
        messages related to this install, perform a FileMan Inquire on 
        the Install file (#9.7).  The message "OK to delete DVBA187P" 
        will be displayed after a successful post install.
