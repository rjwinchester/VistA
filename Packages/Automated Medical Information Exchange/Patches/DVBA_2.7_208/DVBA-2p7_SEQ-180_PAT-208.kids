This patch allows the DVBA C&P SCHD EVENT protocol to be bypassed when
"BLD",11199,1,2,0)
the calling SDAM APPOINTMENT EVENTS protocol is invoked from within
"BLD",11199,1,3,0)
VistA Scheduling GUI, as a GUI user would be unable to answer the user
"BLD",11199,1,4,0)
input prompts for the DVBA protocol. (This patch does not require a GUI
"BLD",11199,1,5,0)
update.)
