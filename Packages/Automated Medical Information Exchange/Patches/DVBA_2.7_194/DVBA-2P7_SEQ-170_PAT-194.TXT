 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000001270435    CAPRI - Other:  2507 INTEGRITY REPORT STATUS
   
    Problem: 
    --------
    While running the Check C&P File Integrity [DVBA C CHECK 2507 
    INTEGRITY] option, the report identifies any records in the 
    2507 REQUEST (396.3) file missing "crucial information".  One 
    such element, is the PRIORITY OF EXAM field (#9), which is no 
    longer populated and should not be used as a validation point 
    going forward.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The PRIORITY OF EXAM (#9) field will be removed from the validation
    logic.

    Documentation:
    --------------
    The Medical Administration Service (MAS) User Manual 
    (DVBA_27_P194_MASUM.PDF) will be updated to replace references to
    "eight" validation points with "seven" as the "PRIORITY OF EXAM" 
    has been removed. 
   
  
  
 2. INC000001275437    CAPRI - Other: cancellation reasons
   
    Problem: 
    --------
    While canceling exams through the Cancel C&P Request/Exams
    [DVBA C CANCEL REQUESTS/EXAMS] option, the option displays and 
    allows selection of cancellation reasons that are currently inactive. 
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Filter the cancelation reasons so that only active reasons are displayed
    and selectable.
