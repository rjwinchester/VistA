  I. OVERVIEW
   
     This patch (DVBA*2.7*189) and CAPRI GUI v189 provide enhancements
     and changes to CAPRI and to the AMIE package (files/fields only).

     Note: There are changes being made to the AMIE files/fields
           to accommodate the GUI changes; however, the AMIE options

  III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
    
     The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality
     that will be delivered in CAPRI GUI v189 and this VistA patch 
     (DVBA*2.7*189).
     
    1. The following Remedy tickets are being addressed:
      
       a. INC000001112581 - After CAPRI was updated, patch DVBA*2.7*187,
          exams are not being released to the RO.
  
       Problem
       -------
  
       When a Patient record was retrieved by Social Security Number,
       the IEN internal record number returned was treated as an
       integer. A signed integer has a range of -2147483648 ..
       2147483647. Some of the Vista systems had modified their
       Patient file to prepend a fixed number to the IEN. This made
       the value larger than the maximum for an integer and CAPRI
       would throw an error.
  
       Solution
       --------
  
       The Patient record IEN is now handled as a set of characters
       and is not converted to an integer number. 
   
    2. The following defects that were reported directly to the CAPRI
       development team are being addressed:
   
       a. Double line displays on FILE menu when user does not have VVA
          or DAS security keys
       
       Problem
       Double line displays on the FILE menu when user does not have
       security keys DVBA CAPRI GETDOCSFROMVLER and DVBA CAPRI GETVBADOCS.
   
       Solution
       Disable extra menu bar line when a user does not have the DVBA
       CAPRI GETDOCSFROMVLER and DVBA CAPRI GETVBADOCS security keys.
   
       b. Get Docs from Virtual VA menu item disabled
   
       Problem
       If the VLER DAS URL was not available, the Get Docs from Virtual
       VA menu item was disabled. NOTE:  CAPRI patch DVBA*2.7*186
       distributed the VLER DAS production URL as an entry in PARAMETER
       DEFINITION file (8989.51); therefore, the VLER DAS Production
       URL should always be available. 
   
       Solution
       If the DAS URL is not available, the Get Docs from DAS menu
       item is disabled.
   
    3. The following enhancements that were requested by Veterans Benefits 
       Administration (VBA), Veterans Administration Central Office (VACO)
       and Disability and Medical Assessment (DMA) are being addressed:
