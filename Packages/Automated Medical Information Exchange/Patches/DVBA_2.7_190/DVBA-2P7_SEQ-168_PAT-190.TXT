 I. OVERVIEW
  
     This patch (DVBA*2.7*190) and CAPRI GUI v190 provide enhancements
     and changes to CAPRI and to the AMIE package (files/fields/security 
     keys only). These file/field/security key changes support CAPRI
     GUI enhancements to provide improvements in C&P Exam templates, data
     processing and tracking, data retrieval, and data accuracy.
  
     Note: There are changes being made to the AMIE files/fields
           to accommodate the GUI changes; however, the AMIE options
           that may be impacted by these changes are not being updated
           to reflect the new GUI functionality.
  
 II. ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS & NEW SERVICE REQUESTS
  
     None   
  
 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
     The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality
     that will be delivered in CAPRI GUI v190 and this VistA patch 
     (DVBA*2.7*190).
  
    1. The following Remedy tickets are being addressed:
  
       None
  
    2. The following defects and/or enhancement request were reported
       directly to the CAPRI development team are being addressed:
  
    a.
       Problem
       -------
  
       CAPRI Contract Referral (CCR) option - Add functionality to "NOT 
       ALLOW" user to proceed, after marking insufficient, until they
       choose "reassign to vendor".
  
       Solution
       --------
       CCR has been modified to not allow a user to proceed after marking 
       insufficient, until they choose the reassign to vendor button.  
       A message stating "You must reassign to vendor before closing", 
       will be displayed.
  
    b.
       Problem
       -------
  
       Request Status by Date Range report is no longer displaying the 
       Station
  
       Solution
       -------- 
  
       Request Status by Date Range report has been modified to display 
       Station for both the Plain Text and Excel report formats.
  
    c.
       Problem
       -------
  
       CAPRI Patch DVBA*2.7*186 introduced a defect where the draft 
       copies of templates are not being deleted when the template(s)
       are completed.  VistA Support/Maintenance received numerous 
       complaints of rapid growth of the ^DVB Global.  This issue has 
       been traced to the fact that CAPRI was no longer deleting backup
       versions of CAPRI templates on completion.  The backup versions
       are in the CAPRI TEMPLATES file (396.17).
  
       Solution
       --------
  
       CAPRI has been modified to include the code that deletes the 
       backup versions in the CAPRI TEMPLATES file (396.17).
  
  
  
    3. The following enhancements that were requested by Veterans Health
       Administration Veterans Affairs Central Office (VHAVACO) and the 
       and Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) are being addressed:
  
       Note: The following enhancements are for CAPRI GUI only. AMIE
       functionality has not been modified.
  
       a. Add the "ACCEPTABLE CLINICAL EVIDENCE" field #1, to the CAPRI
          TEMPLATES file (#396.17), to indicate if Acceptable Clinical
          Evidence was used.
  
       b. Add the patients existing cell phone number and e-mail address
          field from the PATIENT file (#2) to the PENDING C&P EXAMS report
          for the plain text and Excel report outputs.
          
          Add cell phone and e-mail fields to the Address Verification 
          screen (C&P Exam tab|Add a New Request).  These fields will allow
          the user to enter a veteran's cell phone and e-mail address when
          they choose "Edit Address Now".  These values will only be
          displayed in the comments section of the View C&P Exam window.
  
       c. Add the "Electronic Claim Folder Available" selection on the Add
          New C&P Exam screen. This CAPRI GUI field adds a YES/NO response
          to the new ELECTRONIC CLAIM FOLDER AVAIL? field (#21.1) in
          the 2507 REQUEST file #396.3.
  
       d. Add Find/Search functionality currently found in the Notes tab 
          and the Discharge Summaries tab of the Clinical Documents tab,
          to the Consults, Imaging, Nutritional Assessments, and Procedures
          tabs. Add Find functionality to search for words contained on
          the report text Screen (report display on right side of Clinical
          Documents tab).  This will allow user to right click and search
          for words in a report text window.
  
       e. Enable the Mouse roller wheel function to scroll up and 
          down the Disability Benefits Questionnaire page, Add New C&P 
          Exam screen, View C&P Exam screen, Exam Details screen, and the
          C&P Worksheets tab window. 
         
       f. Add the ability for VBA personnel to add/activate/inactivate 
          Cancellation Reasons and Insufficient Reasons to the VistA files
          2507 CANCELLATION REASON file #396.5 and 2507 INSUFFICIENT REASON
          File #396.94.  These options are restricted by security keys DVBA
          CAPRI EXAMCANC and DVBA CAPRI EXAMINSUFF.  The options, Manage
          Exam Cancellation Reasons and Manage Exam Insufficient Reasons,
          will be available from the CAPRI Help menu.
  
       g. C&P Exam tab - Add Claim Type, Special Considerations, and 
          Insufficient field values to the comments section of the
          C&P Exam Request.
  
  
  
    4. New Security Keys
  
       a. DVBA CAPRI EXAMCANC
  
          This key is assigned to VBA personnel only to enable 
          modification of the 2507 CANCELLATION REASON file #396.5. Only 
          contents, not file structure, can be modified with this key.
  
       b. DVBA CAPRI EXAMINSUFF
  
          This key is assigned to VBA personnel only to enable modification
          of 2507 INSUFFICIENT REASON file #396.94. Only contents, not file
          structure, can be modified with this key.
  
  
     5. File Changes
  
       a. 2507 REQUEST (#396.3) DD partial Modification
  
          A new field, ELECTRONIC CLAIM FOLDER AVAIL #21.1 has been added.
          This field stores the response from the Delphi CAPRI GUI 'Add New
          C&P Exam' form, (Yes or No).  The field is a set of codes: Select
          (Y for YES or N for NO), if an Electronic Claim Folder is
          available for this Exam.
                                 
       b. CAPRI TEMPLATES (#396.17) DD partial Modification
  
          A new field, ACCEPTABLE CLINICAL EVIDENCE field #1 has been  
          added. This field stores the Boolean response from the Delphi
          Capri GUI 'Template Screen' form. The field is a set of codes:

          exams, or N if Acceptable Clinical Evidence was not used.
