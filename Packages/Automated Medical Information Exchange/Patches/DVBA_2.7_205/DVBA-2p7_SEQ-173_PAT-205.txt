 I18872737FY18    CAPRI's VistAWeb link will not connect to JLV service
  
 Problem:
 --------
    With the replacement of VistAWeb by JLV, in order for JLV to be 
    accessible, the URL needs to be added in VistA to be retrieved
    by existing remote procedure calls (RPCs). 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
    A post install routine DVBA205P, will be run to add the new DVBAB 
    CAPRI JLV URL record to the PARAMETERS file (#8989.5) with the  
    following values:
  
    ENTITY (PKG): AUTOMATED MED INFO EXCHANGE
    PARAMETER: DVBAB CAPRI JLV URL        INSTANCE: 1
    VALUE: https://jlv.domain.ext/JLV/Login/loginParam?loginSource=CAPRI
  
    Also, this patch will update routine DVBABURL to include code to 
    retrieve the JLV URL when called by the CAPRI RPC. As part of the 
    build install DVBAB CAPRI JLV URL will be added to the PARAMETER 
    DEFINITION (#8989.51) file.
