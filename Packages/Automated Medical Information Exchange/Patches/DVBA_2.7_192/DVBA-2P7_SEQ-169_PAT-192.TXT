Description:
============

 I. OVERVIEW
  
    This patch, DVBA*2.7*192, and CAPRI GUI v192 provide enhancements in 
    C&P Exam templates, data processing and tracking, data retrieval, and 
    data accuracy.  Changes are being made to the AMIE package files and
    fields to support the CAPRI GUI. 
  
  
  
  
      Note: Some AMIE files are being changed to accommodate functional 
            changes to the CAPRI GUI.  However, the functionality of
            corresponding AMIE options has not been updated to mirror
            changes to the GUI.
  
 II. ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS & NEW SERVICE REQUESTS
  
     1. INC000001249163 - The "Cytology" or "Surgical Pathology" report
        freezes.
  
     2. INC000001008110 - CAPRI - Other: Des Moines insufficient exam error
  
        Duplicate: INC000001303460
  
     3. INC000001305051 - CAPRI patch 190 has apparently broken the mouse 
        scroll wheel
  
        Duplicate: INC000001302423
  
 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
     The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality
     that will be delivered in CAPRI GUI v192 and this VistA patch 
     (DVBA*2.7*192).
  
     1. The following Remedy tickets are being addressed:
  
        a. INC000001249163-CAPRI/DoD issue any patient with more than two
          cytology records or surgical path records on the DoD tab will
          cause CAPRI to go into an endless loop when selecting any record
          other than the first two.
  
     Problem
     -------
  
     While running the "Cytology" or "Surgical Pathology" report from the
     DoD tab, if the date range for the report produces more than two
     records, selecting the third record or below will cause CAPRI to go
     into an endless loop and freeze.
  
     Solution
     --------
  
     Modify the record parsing logic so that it correctly relates the
     record, based on the header info passed in, to the corresponding
     record selected in CAPRI.
  
        b. INC000001008110 - CAPRI - Other: Des Moines insufficient exam 
           error.
  
     Problem
     -------
   
     While running the Detailed Insufficient Exam report in CAPRI, if the 
     first record identified in the specified data range has an original
     2507 EXAM (#396.4) record without a DATE OF EXAM (#.06), the current
     logic fails to set the variable DVBADTE which is used to display the
     date in an external format leading to an undefined error.
  
     Solution
     --------
   
     Prior to displaying the report, the code will verify the DVBADTE is
     set and instances where it is not, it will be set to null which
     essentially displays a blank for that value rather than resulting in
     an undefined error.
  
        c. INC000001305051 - CAPRI patch 190 has apparently broken the 
           mouse scroll wheel in the exam results window of the C&P exam 
   
     Problem
     -------
     CAPRI patch 190 added scroll wheel functionality to the view exam
     window of the C&P Exam request which disabled the scroll wheel 
     functionality for the exam result window.
  
     Solution
     --------
  
     Scroll wheel functionality has been removed from the view exam
     window, which in turn will allow scroll wheel functionality in 
     the exam result window.
  
     2. The following defects that were reported directly to the CAPRI
        development team are being addressed.
        
        a. Updated the function of the OK button click when sending the
           exam to VVA.  It ensures that claim attachment objects that are
           allocated for the send to VLER DAS are deallocated correctly.  
           There is no visible difference for the end-user.
   
     3. The following enhancements that were requested by Veterans Health
        Administration Veterans Affairs Central Office (VHAVACO) and the 
        Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) are being addressed:
  
           Note: The following contain enhancements that modify both CAPRI 
           and AMIE software.
  
        a. Reorder the display of exam requests from newest to oldest
           on the C&P Exams Tab.  Sort functionality, default ascending,
           has been added to allow user to view either oldest to newest
           or newest to oldest.  If a user changes tabs after changing the 
           sort to descending the C&P Exams tab will default back to 
           ascending order.
           
  
        b. CAPRI GUI reports (File|reports menu):
           Add the CLAIM TYPE field (#9.1) and SPECIAL CONSIDERATION(S)
           field (#50) of the 2507 REQUEST file (#396.3) to four 
           reports, both plain text and Excel output. In addition 
           to CLAIM TYPE and SPECIAL CONSIDERATION(S) add 
           "Priority of Exam" field (#9) to the "Insufficient Exam
           Report". The four reports involved are:
  
           (1) Insufficient Exam Report
           
           Note: the Summary report selection will no longer be available.
                 This report output will be the detailed report.
  
           (2) Pending C&P Exams
  
           (3) Exam Requests by date range
  
           (4) Request Status by date range
  
        c. Add the ability to retry all Virtual VA (VVA) transmissions
           within the CAPRI GUI. The button for retry capabilities is
           labeled "Retransmit". This option is available from the Virtual 
           VA Transmission Status Window. The end user can, through both
           the File menu option and Report Builder, continue to close or
           cancel the transmission without retransmitting even if the
           transmission of a file(s) to VVA fails. The retransmit button is
           not displayed when the "Transmit File to VVA" succeeds.
  
        d. Add the ability for Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) users
           to review and print Veterans Health Administration completed
           Compensation & Pension examination reports regardless of the
           requesting office. This includes statuses "RELEASED TO RO, NOT
           PRINTED" and "COMPLETED, PRINTED BY RO". VBA personnel do not
           require assignment of the DVBA C SUPERVISOR security key.
  
        e. Removed the below obsolete fields when viewing the Exam Request
           Template in the Add New C&P Exam screen:
         
           (1) All references to M21-1MR 
           (2) All references to 38CFR 
           (3) Any procedure notes
  
        f. Modifications to the CAPRI Contract Referral (CCR) screen:
  
           The CAPRI alerts screen has been modified to display a new 
           message in the "Resolve The Alert" section of the screen. 
        
           (1) The "Resolve This Alert" message has been changed to display
               the following when exams exist: You have X (the number)
               vendor exam requests ready for download.
  
           (2) The "Resolve This Alert" message has been changed to display
               the following when no exams exist: You have no vendor exam
               requests ready for download.
  
           (3) The notification message displayed on the popup window
               previously displayed "Vendor(s) Exam Results have been
               processed for this patient." The new notification message
               displays "Vendor Exam Results have been downloaded for this
               patient."
  
        g. Modification to CAPRI Contract Referral (CCR). Four fields have
           been removed from the "C&P Exam Request Report Management"
           screen:
    
           (1) STATUS
           (2) EXAM LOCATION 
           (3) DATE OF EXAM 
           (4) EXAMINING PROVIDER
  
       h. The following has been removed from the CCR - Contractor Editor
          screen: 
  
           Email Address
  
       i. Add the ability in the CAPRI Contract Referral (CCR) module to
          maintain and review remarks added  when referring exams to a
          contractor. Those remarks will be available and viewable when the
          exam report is returned by the contractor.
  
       j. The "AMIS 290" and "AMIS 290 by division" reports have been
          disabled in the CAPRI GUI. "AMIS 290 for the Regional Office" 
          and "AMIS 290 Report For C&P" have been disabled in the Automated
          Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) System. CAPRI displays the
          URL http://vaww.demo.domain.ext/dmareports.asp to get these reports.
          The AMIE options "AMIS 290 for the Regional Office" and "AMIS 290
          Report for C&P " have been changed to redirect the user to the
          new URL for these reports.

           This routine has been modified to allow Veterans Benefits
           Administration (VBA) users to review, print, and reprint
           Veterans Health Administration completed Compensation & Pension
           examination reports located under the Compensation and Pension
