 1. INC1497901 - Change CAPRI to call new LCM (formerly called Virtual VA) URLs
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Back in April 2018, LCM upgraded to new WebLogic servers which resulted
    in them having new hostnames.  As a workaround to avoid impacting our
    integration partners using LCM's web services, aliases were created in
    the Domain Name System (DNS), pointing old hostnames to the new
    servers.  The workaround solution is not intended to be a long term
    solution but rather a solution to allow LCM the flexibility to work with
    integration partners to change to new URLs. Since CAPRI is one of LCM's
    integration partners, LCM is requesting CAPRI to make changes to call
    new LCM web services URLs.  Below are the new LCM URLs:
  
 For Production-
 https://vbaphiprdwlsappa.vba.domain.ext:7002/VABFI/services/vva?wsdl
 For Test- 
 https://vbaphitstwlsappa.vba.domain.ext:7002/VABFI/services/vva
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Post-install routine DVBA207P will update the PARAMETERS (#8989.5) file
    to use the new LCM URLs. The PARAMETER (#.02) field in the
    PARAMETERS (#8989.5) file to update are DVBAB CAPRI VIRTUALVA PROD URL
    and DVBAB CAPRI VIRTUALVA TEST URL.
  
 TEST SITES:
 -----------
