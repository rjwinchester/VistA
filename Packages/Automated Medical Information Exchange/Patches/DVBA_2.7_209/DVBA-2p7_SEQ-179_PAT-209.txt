  - Other

Description:
============

 The Separation Health Assessment (SHA) is a comprehensive medical 
 examination conducted by either the Veterans Affairs (VA) or Department of
 Defense (DoD) for Separating Service Members (SSMs) who file pre-discharge
 claims under the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) Program.  The SHA is
 used by both the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and DoD to
 evaluate a SSM's disability(ies) and determine benefits eligibility
 according to a common standard. The VA and DoD need the ability
 to share the SHA results as soon as they become available (on or prior 
 to the Release from Active Duty [RAD] date). To avoid duplication of
 health assessments between the two departments, VA assessments are used by
 DoD.
 There are three new fields added in this patch that will be included in 
 all DBQs. These are the Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier 
 (EDIPI), the Release from Active Duty (RAD) field and the Pre-discharge 
 flag. 
 New functionality has been added to account for failed transmission.  
 If transmission fails between CAPRI and Data Access Services (DAS), the 
 user will be prompted with a message giving the user an option to
 retransmit up to 5 times before being prompted to contact the national
 help desk.
  
 The following Data Dictionary changes to CAPRI DIVISION EXAM LIST File
 (#396.15) DISABLE ALL EXAMS? field (#4) have been made to provide the user
 more direction when adding a Division entry:
 -Field name change from DISABLE ALL EXAMS? to DISABLE ALL C&P EXAMS?
 -Entry in field is now required
 -Help and Technical Prompts have additional information to explain options

 -2507 Request without Regional Office (RO) values
 -Copy & Paste crash issues
 -Inconsistent routing locations on 7131 requests
 -7131 requests automatically closing in AMIE

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1) I7798288FY16/553087   CAPRI - C&P Exam Requests missing RO value 
   
    Problem: 
    --------
    When marking a 2507 Exam as insufficient, when creating the new 
    request, if the Regional Office has more than one match in the VAMC by
    name, the update will fail to populate the Regional Office because it
    cannot find a unique value based on the name.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Rather than using the name to identify the Regional Office, CAPRI will 
    now pass the internal entry number of the Institution File record as
    there will be only one entry for each internal value.
   
  
 2) I9127673FY16/553089   CAPRI: Copying with CTRL C causes CAPRI to crash 
    duplicate:  I10983321FY17
    duplicate:  I11270080FY17
    duplicate:  I11995613FY17
    duplicate:  I9127811FY16
  
   
    Problem: 
    --------
    Attempting to copy or paste from the exam "Cancel Comments" box on
    the "Exam Details" screen of CAPRI using CTRL C or CTRL V causes a    
    fatal crash of CAPRI.  Using the mouse right-click menu to    
    copy/paste does not cause this failure.
  
    Attempting to copy from the "Routing Location Information" box on
    the "Add New C&P Exam" screen of CAPRI using CTRL C causes a fatal  
    crash of CAPRI. Using the mouse right-click menu to copy does not
    cause this failure. 
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The code in CAPRI that handles the CopyToClipboard, CutToClipboard
    and PasteFromCliboard has been changed to set the current Edit Box    
    or Memo Box as the ActiveControl.  This tells the Windows API what
    control to copy/cut/paste to or from.
  
 3) I15864002FY17/588679 CAPRI: inconsistent routing locations on 7131
                         requests
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    When a user creates a new 7131 request using the 7131 requests tab 
    in CAPRI, the list of routing locations available is identical to 
    what is set to active under the "edit exam list parameters (MAS)" 
    utility in CAPRI.  However, if the user goes back into the 7131 
    request, CAPRI displays every routing location (both active and 
    inactive) as options to the user.  
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    When populating the list or routing locations on a 7131 Edit, CAPRI
    will now filter out inactive locations.
  
 4) I18426774FY18/894638  CAPRI 7131 requests automatically closing in AMIE
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    CAPRI currently allows a 7131 to be submitted without checking any of 
    the checkboxes on the "New 7131 Request" form.  The FORM 7131 (#396)
    record is created, but because there are not any items identified by
    checkboxes the request is auto finalized (essentially closed) without
    any data returned.
    An additional request came in to force users to also enter "Comments" 
    when submitting a 7131.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Prior to allowing a user to submit a 7131 request, CAPRI will check  
    and force at least one checkbox to be marked and data to be entered
    into the "Comments" memo box.
  
  
 5) I12188347FY17/553078 CAPRI exams not closing out properly when a DBQ is
                         cancelled
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    If a 2507 Request has multiple exams and the exams have a mixed bag of 
    completed/canceled statuses AND the last exam satisfied is canceled
    the corresponding 2507 Exam Status is not updated and the 2507 is 
    not released even though all exams have been satisfied.
   
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    When canceling a 2507 Exam, CAPRI will now check to see if there are
    any remaining open exams on the 2507 Request.  If there are not, it
    will update the status and release the exam.
  
 6) I13232280FY17/553080  CAPRI "Validate Remote Connections" problem
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    When on the "Validate Remote Connections" screen and checking 
    connections for multiple entries, there is potential for one entry to
    fail and provide incorrect results for the subsequent tests
    automatically.  This happens when a connection timeout occurs and CAPRI
    does not handle the failed attempt correctly resulting in subsequent
    failures. 
    
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    When connection timeouts occur, CAPRI will reset the broker variables 
    which would allow it to truly test each subsequent record.
  
 7) I7855778FY16/553084 CAPRI is unable to access Upstate New York HCS 
                        using Enterprise Search
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the Enterprise Search functionality, CAPRI can indicate a 
    user is unable to access certain sites due to issues with how CAPRI
    evaluates permissions.
         
     
    Resolution:
    -----------
    When evaluating permissions, rather than using the selected entries 
    site number to validate, CAPRI will now use the full facility name to
    compare with the site list the user has access to so that it will be
    able to appropriately grant access (or deny).
  
  
 8) I11409458FY17/553076  CAPRI Enterprise Search issue (see attachments) 
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    After performing an "Enterprise Search" in CAPRI, the results returned 
    may include non VAMC entities that are not accessible.  If the user
    tries to connect to one of these entries they are presented an error
    indicating they don't have access to the site or some other issue
    occurred preventing the connection.  This causes confusion for VBA
    users who are tasked with collecting all relevant health information.
   
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Now, after selecting a non VAMC entity to connect to, a message will be
    displayed indicating that the entry selected is not a VA treatment
    facility containing patient records.
  
 9) I13483878FY17/894644  CAPRI Enterprise Search Concern
  
    Problem:
    --------
    According to the CAPRI user manual, Enterprise Search is supposed to 
    require First Name, Last Name, SSN, and Date of Birth. However, CAPRI
    is not physically requiring the Date of Birth field to be completed
    before allowing searches.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    CAPRI GUI code modified to review and validate the DOB field.  DOB is 
    now a required field.
  
  
 10) I18189589FY18/894652 CAPRI Enterprise Search does not work from-to
                          Portland
  
     Problem: 
     --------
     If a CAPRI user is connected to a site and does an "Enterprise 
     Search" and the search identifies the site the user is currently
     connected to as a "Treating Facility", if the user attempts to
     "Connect to Site" there is potential to get into an endless loop where
     the end user is continuously prompted for a select to site.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     CAPRI will now compare the "connect to" site with the currently 
     connected site and if they are the same, present the user with a
     message/error indicating they are already connected to the site and to
     use the "Patient Selector" to select the patient in question.
  
 11) INC0629993/894656 A CAPRI bug has been identified where the mouse
                       cursor changes to an hourglass, then never changes
                       back.
  
     Problem: 
     --------
     When the user presses "OK" on the Preview Window, the mouse cursor 
     will change to the loading symbol (a wheel or potentially an hour
     glass) for an extended duration of time, before returning to the
     default cursor pointer.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     A line of code was added at the end of SaveExamsToMemory which 
     returns the cursor to its default state after the user presses "OK" on
     the Preview Window and SaveExamsToMemory finishes executing.
  
 12) INC3159682/86183 CAPRI GUI-Your Client software is older that the
                      server on Vista
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Patch 193.12 introduced version control for the GUI to confirm that 
     the user was using the latest version after a deadline date.  Users
     were receiving an error after the deadline even if they were using the
     most current GUI version.
  
     Resolution:
     ----------
     If the patch number check fails it falls back to a date located in 
     the PARAMETERS file.  We found a problem in the code that is failing
     the patch number check which appears to have been hard coded sometime
     prior to patch 193.10.  This hardcoded code is being removed and
     corrected.
  
 13) 876380   Update RPC logger code to improve CAPRI Performance
  
     Problem:
     --------
     CAPRI Patch 193 included an update to create an RPC log that could be 
     used to better identify errors received in the field. The logger was
     set to store 3 days' worth of logs that could be used for debugging.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Change of the RPC logger's default status to OFF and will create a 
     new parameter that will allow the logger to be turned ON when 
     needed by a member of the IT support team.
  
 14) INC2749812/876380 ERIE - DVBA C Check  2507 Integrity Report
                       findings
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The report includes two entries, both patients have cancelled exams.  
     Two exams found on one patient one from 1995, the other 2014.  The
     second patient has one entry from 1995.
  
     Resolution:
     ----------
     Patch 193.12 changed the screening process for this report. Routine 
     DVBCCHKR is being modified to check and screen those exams in a 
     cancelled status.
  
 15) INC2754318/876379 CAPRI - Portland cannot see exams transferred from
                       R01
  
     Problem:
     --------
     C&P exams are not being transferred to sites if the patient is not 
     registered at the receiving site. Routine DVBCXFRC is expecting data
     parameters not being set in the bulletin receiving routine.
  
     Resolution:
     ----------
     Routine DVBCXFRB is being modified to set the necessary variables 
     required to enter the new patient information into the receiving sites
     file.
  
 16) INC3221099/876378 New C&P Divisions being set to active
  
     Problem:
     --------
     New Divisions being added to the MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION File (#40.8) 
     and then being added to CAPRI DIVISION EXAM LIST File (#396.15) are
     being marked as active if the DISABLE ALL EXAMS? field is left null
  
     Resolution:
     ----------
     DISABLE ALL EXAMS? field (#4) of DIVISION EXAM LIST File (#396.15) 
     name change to DISABLE ALL C&P EXAMS? and will be made a required
     field and more exact verbiage will be added to the help text for 
     this field.
     A post-install routine will review existing entries and if Null
     will set the status to "No". 
  
 17) INC1885947/941346  CAPRI C&P template bug with keyboard navigation
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When using the keyboard to navigate the templates listed in the 
     "Available Templates" or "Selected Templates" lists in CAPRI, the 
     "Description" text does not update. This text only updates when a
     template is selected via a mouse click.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modify ListBoxTemplatesChange and ListBoxSelectedTemplatesChange to 
     update FMCommentsMemo when a new template is selected. This will allow
     the "Description" text to be accurate when using keyboard navigation.
  
 18) INC1315324/951874  CAPRI edit exam list parameters MAS option - bug
                        allows all divisions to be displayed.
  
     Problem:
     --------
     If all Divisions are disabled in CAPRI DIVISION EXAM LIST File  
     (#396.15), then CAPRI will allow all routing locations as selectable
     when Adding a New Request. This could lead to misrouted requests and
     claims processing delays.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Prevent all Divisions from being disabled in CAPRI to avoid these 
     situations. If all CAPRI DIVISION EXAM LIST File (#396.15) Division's
     DISABLE ALL EXAMS? field (#4) are set to "YES", display no routing
     location options on the Add New C&P Exam form.
  
 19) INC3199960/894659  CAPRI errors 
  
     Problem:
     --------
     An error occurs during the co-signature process due to expected CAPRI 
     TEMPLATE values being undefined during the signature process causing
     the save process to fail while updating the 2507 EXAM File (#396.4).
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The CAPRI code has been modified to identify the relevant data 
     regardless of the signature process so the records can file
     correctly.

 Post-Installation Instructions

 N/A
  
 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------------
 Back-out Procedures are only needed if there are major problems (examples 
 include the KIDS notice of incompletion or hard errors) resulting from the
 installation of this patch. Log a ServiceNow helpdesk ticket so the 
 development team can assist in this process.
  
  
 Prior to installing a patch, the site/region should have saved a back-up 
 of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport Global 
 [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install). The message 
 containing the backed-up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" 
 function at the Message Action prompt. The Packman function 
 "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the backed-up routines.
