Subject: CAPRI XML DATA TYPES UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Compensation and Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI) currently operates on
 XML schema 1.0 when transmitting Disability Benefits Questionnaires
 (DBQ's). To comply with Information Exchange Packet Documentation
 standards for transmitting data and to maintain system and security
 standards, an update is required to the most current standards.
 These changes are for the following fields of data:
 -Facility Type
 -Service Provider Client Association Type
 -Exam Detail Type
 -Claim Information Type
 -Veteran of Interest Type
 -Document Type
 -Service Provider Type
 -Approver Type
 -Person Type
 -Client Type
  
  
 Patch DVBA*2.7*212 will also fix the following issues:
 -Other Facilities Visited button/message will be updated to display an 
  appropriate message to users
 -Date Completed and Date Released do not get populated when exam 
  templates are co-signed
 -Enterprise Search not routing appropriately
 -Transmission to VLER Failed message not accurate in some cases

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
  
 1) INC4579384 - bad message treatment facilities
  
    Problem:
    ---------
    The other facilities visited button/message was displaying a generic 
    message that was not clear as to why switching to a site was rejected
    if it was a non-treatment facility.
    The previous message would inform the user to attempt manually 
    switching sites using File->Switch Sites. This lead users down a wild
    goose chase as non-treatment facilities cannot be accessed this way
    either. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    CAPRI will be updated to display an appropriate message to users as to 
    the reason they cannot access the site.
  
  
 2) INC5702037 - CAPRI - cannot cosign templates/exams
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Using the CPRS C&P Cosignature Transfer Utility option in CAPRI to 
    cosign exams lead to errors caused from incorrect data being passed to 
    VistA when it is updated/saved. Version control logic that was making a
    broker call overwrote the results needed to properly cosign an exam
  
  
    Resolution: 
    -----------
    By moving the version control logic to the beginning of the procedure, 
    we prevent the accidental override of data. This will allow users to 
    cosign exams successfully utilizing the CPRS C&P Cosignature Transfer 
    Utility option.
  
  
 3) INC5890511 - Enterprise Search not routing appropriately for 
                 Fayetteville,NC
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the CAPRI Enterprise Search to find a veteran, if the 
    veteran has a record in Fayetteville, NC when you select the site and
    click the "Connect to Site" button, CAPRI takes you to Fayetteville, AR
    instead.
    If you search for a Fayetteville, AR patient it will correctly take 
    you to Fayetteville, AR.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified the validation logic utilized when selecting a site to 
    evaluate the entire site name, thus preventing CAPRI from connecting
    the user to the incorrect site (such as Fayetteville,AR instead of
    Fayetteville,NC). The user will now be routed to the correct
    destination.
  
 4) INC5523597 - "Transmission to VLER Failed" message not accurate in 
                  some cases
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In CAPRI patch DVBA*2.7*209 a change was made when an exam failed to 
    transmit it will attempt to re-transmit up to 5 times, after the fifth-
    re-attempt, a message is presented to the user "Transmission to VLER 
    failed.  Please contact the IT National Service Desk at 
    1-855-673-4357."
  
    Since the release of this patch multiple tickets have been submitted 
    where CAPRI attempts to re-transmit 5 times, but indicates that all 5
    attempts failed.  However, in some cases the attempt was successful.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modification was made to the logic used to determine if the re-attempt
    was successful.  This modification will accurately account for a
    transmission that may have been transmitted correctly within the 5 
    re-attempts.
  
 5) RTC1118254 - IOC testing Defect Found at Tampa VAMC
  
    Problem
    -------
    Extra characters are being generated within the EDIPI field when 
    running CAPRI Vista patch DVBA*2.7*212 V2 with CAPRI GUI
    DVBA*2.7*209.01(current production version)
  
    Resolution
    ----------
    Due to the possibility of C&P sites not installing both patches at the 
    same time the team created a new RPC's for VistA that can pull the
    correct data field for patch 209 and 212.
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 Tampa
 Minneapolis
 Greater LA
