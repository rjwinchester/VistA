Description:
============

   I. OVERVIEW
  
    This patch (DVBA*2.7*186) and CAPRI GUI v186 provides enhancements
    and  defect fixes for the CAPRI GUI and the Automated Medical 
    Information Exchange (AMIE) package.  Please refer to the 
    'FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW' section (III) for the specific changes and 
    primary functionality being delivered.
  
    This patch introduces enhancements to the AUTOMATED MED INFO EXCHANGE
    (AMIE) V 2.7 package in support of VLER DAS.
  
    This Veterans Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) Data Access Service
    (DAS) patch will file XML exam results to the VistA 2507 EXAM file 
    (#396.4).
  
    VLER DAS Changes Background
  
    In support of the VLER DAS and Veterans Benefit Management
    System (VBMS) efforts to receive and process computable data, 
    changes will be necessary to CAPRI, Progress Note Construction
    Set (PNCS) and the individual CAPRI DBQ templates to transmit an XML
    file of DBQ data elements through the VLER DAS.
  
  
    In response to changes in technical dependencies:
      1.  VBMS requires ability for a PDF be transmitted with the XML
          file.
      2.  The Harris solution has been put on hold; duration unknown.
          We will no longer use the XML schema provided by Harris.
      3.  New terminology standards will need to be established. Scope
          of terminology can add complexity.
      4.  VA will design XML schema to fit the requirements.
      5.  VLER DAS web service will no longer provide the one-way SSL.
          It will provide no SSL. The web service configurations for
          CAPRI will need to be modified.
      6.  Due to the fact that VA will be integrating the terminology
          standards for the XML and designing the XML schema, code 
          changes in PNCS will be required to enable DBQ data to be read
          and analyzed by other VA systems.
  
  
  
 II. ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS & NEW SERVICE REQUESTS
   
    The following section lists the Remedy tickets and/or New Service 
    Requests associated with this patch:
  
     1. INC000000932543 - Manual "transmit to virtual VA" function. 
                          CAPRI is no longer asking for transmission

 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
   
    The following is an overview of the changes and primary
    functionality that will be delivered in CAPRI GUI v186 and this
    VistA patch (DVBA*2.7*186).
     
    1. The following Remedy tickets are being addressed:
  
      a.  INC000000932543 - Manual "transmit to virtual VA" function.
                            CAPRI is no longer asking for transmission
                            confirmation.  
       
          Problem
          -------
          The confirmation message is no longer displayed when manual
          "Transmit to VVA" is utilized. This defect was introduced when
          the "automatic transmission" to VVA was distributed.
  
          Solution
          --------
          CAPRI has been modified to display the confirmation when
          "Transmit to VVA" option is  utilized.
  
      b.  INC000000939292 - Remove all special characters in metadata
          provided to Virtual VA    
  
          Problem
          -------
          Remove special characters from header fields in any transmission
          to Virtual VA: Virtual VA cannot process any fields in the header
          information that have special characters.  This includes the
          Source Comment and the Subject (exam name).  
  
  
          Solution
          --------
          Currently, "&", "(", ")" are used in exam names but CAPRI doesn't
          control these names. Replaced "&" with "and".  Replaced any of
          the following special characters with a space:
          ()-_+=!@#$%^&*[]{}\|;:'"<>/?`~,.
  
  
    2. The following enhancements that were requested by Veterans Health
       Administration Veterans Affairs Central Office (VHAVACO) are being
       addressed:
  
      a.  CAPRI DBQ Template Data Tagging and VLER DAS Transmission
  
           VLER DAS - 
           In support of the Veterans Lifetime Electronic Record
           (VLER) Data Access Service (DAS) and Veterans Benefit
           Management System (VBMS) efforts to receive and
           process computable data, changes will be necessary to
           CAPRI and the individual CAPRI DBQ templates to
           transmit an XML file of DBQ data elements through the
           VLER DAS.
  
           Transmission of DBQ XML data to VLER/DAS:
           Add SSL to the XML DBQ data transmission to VLER/DAS.  This is
           achieved using 1-Way SSL to a new Authentication Server instead
           of directly to VLER and then 2-way SSL from the new
           Authentication Server to VLER/DAS.  CAPRI sends an
           Authentication Token to the Authentication Server for
           validation of the user's credentials, in addition to the normal
           payload intended for the VLER/DAS webservers. The 
           authentication token is obtained using remote BSE from current 
           login of user to validate all requests to new Authentication 
           Server. Created a new Authenticator process. This process takes
           input of a remote BSE token and validates it against CLAIMS in
           production. Created a new Authentication webserver process in 
           Weblogic answering all requests from CAPRI intended for VLER. 
           The Authentication webserver acts as a secure bridge that
           securely transports authorized DBQs from CAPRI to VLER DAS.
           This is achieved by parsing the incoming request for remote
           BSE token. The token is separately passed to the newly created
           Authenticator process. Once authentication is received from the
           Authenticator process, the security token is deemed valid and 
           the Authentication webserver process forwards the DBQ to VLER
           DAS using two-way (mutual) SSL.  VLER response is sent back to
           the original requesting CAPRI instance. Authentication Server
           to VLER  communication is all done over 2-way SSL. The 
           Authentication Server is needed due to the current architecture
           of VLER, which at the time, only supports server to server 
           communication using two-way (mutual) SSL.
  
  
    3.  The following defects that were reported directly to the CAPRI
        development team are being addressed:
  
      a.  Change indexing values for automated insertions of completed 
          exams to Virtual VA (VVA) to C&P Exam and Exam Type 
  
        Problem
        -------
        Currently automated transmissions to VVA are indexed as follows:
            Document Type:  CAPRI
            Subject:  Clinical Documents
  
        Solution
        --------
        Indexing values for automated transmissions to VVA will now be 
        indexed as follows:
            Document Type:  C&P Exam
            Subject:  Exam Type
  
  
      b.  CAPRI Contract Referral (CCR) option: If a patient has a
          "BAD ADDRESS INDICATOR" set to "YES" in Vista a pop-up does
          not appear prior to referring an exam to a vendor. 
  
        Problem
        -------
        In DemTran Production, Version: 1.3.2.6 demTRAN.exe 6/29/2012
        8:41 AM.
        This pop-up occurs as follows, CAPRI CCR option should also
        display this message to the user.
  
        Patient's record has been flagged with the 'Bad Address 
        Indicator': HOMELESS (for example).  Address information will 
        NOT be included in the documents supplied to the contractor 
        until the indicator is removed or unless VBA has included an
        address in the remarks section of the 2507. Do you wish to continue
        with Check-Out/Resend processing?  Yes / No
     
  
        Solution
        --------
        CCR has been modified to display message to user when the patient's
        record is flagged with "Bad Address Indicator" in VistA. 
  
  
      c.  Timeliness Report Has Negative Average Days. 
  
        Problem
        -------
        Report showing negative average for contractors. When each 2507
        request is examined by the timeliness report, the average is being
        calculated based on more than one exam if more than one exam is 
        associated to the request. CCR should only base its average 
        calculation on the exam that took the longest to complete. Also, 
        if more than one exam is associated to the request but split up
        across multiple vendors, the calculation should create and average
        entry of each vendor that has all their exams completed. If an exam
        is canceled and another exam is associated to the same request with
        the same vendor, then a calculation needs to be produced.
     
  
        Solution
        --------
        Changed the calculation basis based on the exam associated to the
        request. The exam that was open the longest is the basis for the
        average day calculation. If one exam is finished and another 
        assigned to the same contractor is open, the calculation will be
        skipped until all exams are closed.
  
  
      d.  CCR does not allow [COMPLETED] 2507 EXAM REQUESTS to be
          Automatically Released to R.O. by Capri - when a "Split" referral
          is used, and the contracted exam is downloaded through CCR prior
          to a last on-site exam being signed-off in Capri.
  
        Problem
        -------
        CCR does not allow [COMPLETED] 2507 EXAM REQUESTS to be
        Automatically Released to R.O. by Capri - when a "Split" referral
        is used, and the contracted exam is downloaded through CCR prior to
        a last on-site exam being signed-off in Capri.   
      
  
        Solution
        --------
        Fixed by correcting the erroneous references to field 90 in file
        396.4  to their correct field reference, i.e. field 102
  
  
      e.  Transmission to VLER DAS is delayed due to size of PDFs being
          transmitted
         
        Problem
        -------
        Transmission to VLER DAS is delayed due to size of PDFs being
        transmitted
  
        Solution
        --------
        Add PDF Compression and linearization to the PDF exam results file
        sent to VLER/DAS. PDF compression reduces the PDF file size which,
        in turn, reduces transmission times. The following files are
        needed for PDF compression and must be located in the same 
        directory as the CAPRI GUI:  QPDF.EXE, QPDF13.DLL, 
        LIBGCC_S_DW2-1.DLL, LIBSTDC++-6.DLL.
  
  
  
    4.  2507 EXAM (#396.4) file changes: Data Dictionary (partial)
  
       To support the VLER DAS contract, the following fields will be added
       to the 2507 EXAM (#396.4) file to support the filling of the 2507
       Exam XML
  
          - 72  : EXAM RESULTS XML - The XML filed by the VLER DAS
          - 73  : XML DAS Confirmation - The VLER DAS XML confirmation
                  status message passed in from the application.
          - 74  : XML Transmission Date/Time - The VistA system date
                  and time of the XML storage.
  
  
    5.  CAPRI TEMPLATES (#396.17) file change: Data Dictionary (partial)
  
       To support the VLER DAS contract, the following field will be added
       to the CAPRI TEMPLATES (#396.17) file to support the linking of
       TIU document to the CAPRI TEMPLATE file
  
          - 23  : TIU DOCUMENT - POINTER TO TIU DOCUMENT FILE (#8925)

            P2 DAS     is the XML DAS Confirmation message
            P3 XML     is the array list format of the template being
                       stored
  
        b. DVBA CAPRI EXAM LINK TIU
           (New)
           Links an exam in CAPRI TEMPLATES #396.17 to TIU DOCUMENT #8925

            P2 TIUIEN   is the TIU IEN in TIU DOCUMENT #8925
  
  
        c. DVBA CAPRI GET EXAM IEN
           (New)
           Get an exam IEN from the CAPRI TEMMPLATE #396.17 given a TIU
           IEN from TIU DOCUMENT #8925

 VI. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS/NOTES:
  
  1. Users On the System
  
     a. This patch (DVBA*2.7*186) may be installed while CAPRI users are
        still using the previously released version of the CAPRI GUI
        (i.e. DVBA_27_185.exe).
  
     b. Once the installation of this patch has been completed, CAPRI users
        should be upgraded to the new released version of the CAPRI GUI
        (CAPRI.exe [DVBA_27_P186_10.zip]). Please refer to the 
        CAPRI_GUI_ISG.doc document within the DVBA_27_P186_10.zip file
        for supplemental installation instructions regarding the
        installation of the following files:

     c. This patch modifies routines used by the CAPRI GUI application 
        and the Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) package. It
        should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to
        users and to reduce the possibility of errors when the routines are
        updated.
  
  2. VistA Options
         
     a. The following VistA options should be disabled while installing
        this patch: NONE.
  
  3. Software Installation Time
  
     a. The estimated installation time for VistA patch DVBA*2.7*186 is 
        less than 5 minutes during off peak hours.
   
  4. Required Builds
  
     a. The following is a list of REQUIRED builds for this KIDS
        distribution (DVBA*2.7*186). KIDS will not allow the installation
        of this patch without their prior installation.
  
        Required Builds:
        ----------------
        DVBA*2.7*181

 VII. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
    2. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select
       the Installation menu.
  
    3. From this menu, you may now elect to use the following options (when
       prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*186).
  
       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
          to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
          global.
       d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package DVBA*2.7*186.
  
    5. If prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
       Install? NO//', respond NO.
  
    6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       NO//', it is recommended you answer NO.
  
    7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
    8. If CAPRI GUI users have not already been upgraded to the new 
       version of the CAPRI GUI v186 (CAPRI.exe [DVBA_27_P186_10.zip]), 
       they should be upgraded as soon as possible upon installation of 
       this patch.
  
    9.  NOTE: Post-install routine DVBA186P is a temporary routine used
        as part of the post-install process. This routine will not be
        automatically deleted by KIDS after patch installation. After
        verifying that "VLER DAS-CAPRI" is listed in the Remote
        Application file (#8994.5), you may manually delete this
        routine.
