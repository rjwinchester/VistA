Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
 * There is a pre-install check that is done to ensure sites followed the *
 * post-install instructions contained in patch MPIF*1.0*56. If that      *
 * setup was not completely done, this patch will not install. This is to *
 * ensure site's users do not have errors after installation.  Refer to   *
 * the install instructions of patch MPIF*1.0*56 for more information.    *
 *                                                                        *
 * This patch may be installed with users on the system, however we       *
 * strongly advise that it be installed after business hours.             *
 **************************************************************************
  
 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems.
  
 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) enhancements are being distributed in
       three VistA namespaces: DG, RG and MPIF.
       The enhancements related to this patch are only being distributed in
       the DG and MPIF VistA namespaces. MPIF*1.0*61 should be installed
       before DG*5.3*915 for non-legacy sites, as the new registration 
       functionality being exported in this patch will not work without 
       MPIF*1.0*61. (Do NOT install MPIF*1.0*61 on legacy sites.)
       Therefore it is recommended that these patches be installed in the
       following order on non-legacy sites: 
              MPIF*1.0*61 and then DG*5.3*915.
       
       DG*5.3*915 should be installed immediately after installing 
       MPIF*1.0*61.
  
  
 This enhancement patch provides support for patch DG*5.3*915 and the new 
 Enterprise Registration processes to improve the Veterans' experience at 
 VA facilities by allowing new local patients to be looked up directly in 
 the Master Veteran Index (MVI).  The data from the new patient's MVI 
 record is automatically imported into the local site as well as an 
 attempt to obtain the Enrollment System (ES) data when possible. 
 In addition, this Enterprise Registration also allows for lookup and import
 of Department of Defense (DoD) data if the patient is a new patient to the
 VA system.
  
  
 New Application Programmer Interfaces (API):
 PATIENT^MPIFXMLP - This new API allows the Registration (DG) package to 
 do a probabilistic search in the MVI using a web service call.  Traits
 passed in to the API will be utilized to search for existing patients on
 the MVI.  If no existing patients are found, the MVI will search DoD
 records for an existing record match. Any patients found will be returned
 to the Registration (DG) package.
  
 ENP^MPIFVER - This API will take results received from the probabilistic
 search and present them to the user for viewing and selection.  If a 
 record is selected, the API will verify data and return information to the 
 Registration (DG) package about the record that was selected and verified.
  
 GETICN^MPIFXMLI - This API will allow the Registration (DG) package to 
 add a patient to the MVI system.  Traits passed in will be used to  create
 the MVI record via a web service call.  Upon successful completion a new
 Integration Control Number (ICN) will be returned.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The pre-init routine MPIFP61 will verify that sites followed the
 post-install instructions contained in the released patch MPIF*1.0*56.
 If that setup was not completed successfully, then this patch will not
 install, which will ensure that site's users do not encounter errors
 after installing this patch. Please refer to the install instructions of
 patch MPIF*1.0*56 for additional information.   
  
 As part of the post installation process, sites will be required to
 manually modify the MPI_PSIM_EXECUTE web server entry in their
 production account to ensure it is directed at the MVI load balancer. This
 will ensure messages are reliably routed when specific nodes are down.  
   
   
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 ----------------------------- 
 This patch takes less than 2 minutes to install. This patch may be 
 installed with users on the system, however we strongly advise that it be
 installed after business hours.  
 The associated patch DG*5.3*915 should be installed immediately after this
 patch is installed.  
  
 The following OPTIONs should be disabled during installation:
      Load/Edit Patient Data                      [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
      Register a Patient                          [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
      Preregister a Patient                       [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]
      Electronic 10-10EZ Processing               [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING] 
      Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES]
  
 The HL7 incoming filers should be stopped.  Use the Monitor, Start, Stop
 Filers [HL FILER MONITOR] option on the Filer and Link Management Options
 [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu on the HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU].
  
   
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch 
     number (i.e. MPIF*1.0*61):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
  
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//', respond as per your facility's policy.  If you
     choose to answer YES, then at the end of the patch installation,
     KIDS will rebuild the menus which may take several hours and could
     disrupt Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) users.  If your
     facility has the XQBUILDTREEQUE nightly batch job tasked to run, 
     answer NO to this question. The nightly job will rebuild the menus
     as scheduled.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
     respond NO.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
