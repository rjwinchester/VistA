Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ENHANCEMENTS - DATE OF DEATH UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems or the FORUM CLAIMS system (since it is NOT a Veterans
       Affair Medical Center (VAMC) VistA system).
  
 MPIF*1.0*61 and MPIF*1.0*66 are the required builds for patch MPIF*1.0*67.
   
 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) enhancements are being distributed in
       two VistA namespaces: DG and MPIF.
       Patches DG*5.3*963 and MPIF*1.0*67 can be installed in any order
       as there are NO dependencies between these patches.
       (Do NOT install MPIF*1.0*67 on legacy sites or on the FORUM CLAIMS
        system). 
   
 NOTE: Legacy sites and the FORUM CLAIMS system can install just the
       DG*5.3*963 patch. MPIF*1.0*67 should NOT be installed on legacy
       sites or on the FORUM CLAIMS system.  
   
 The following Date of Death (DOD) activity checks and Enterprise 
 Registration enhancements exported in this patch were requested by the
 Healthcare Identity Management (HC IdM) business group in support of the
 Master Veteran Index (MVI) application.
  
 Enhancement #1
 HC IdM noted that there were task(s) being logged for a patient who had
 a prescription login date/time that was greater than their date of death
 (DOD). These false positives occurring in the DOD activity check process
 are due to the fact that prescription login contains both a date and time 
 value, whereas the DOD usually only has a date. The DOD activity check
 process for prescription initial fills, partial fills and refills in
 routine MPIFDODC has been enhanced to now only use the date portion of
 the prescription login when comparing against the DOD when determining if
 the patient still has future activities at the site.
    
 Enhancement #2
 MPI has encountered appointment exceptions being generated when there are
 no exceptions. These exceptions have been determined to be caused when
 there is a correlation to the VistA site, but the VistA site doesn't have
 the  corresponding record. This issue is causing the DOD activity checker
 to return an indication of activity for the patient who doesn't actually
 exist at the site. To prevent this false positive indication, routine
 MPIFDODC has been enhanced to ensure that the patient actually exists at
 the site prior to performing any of the DOD activity checks.
  
  Note: Ultimately the majority of these missing records at the site
        are due to the Veterans Online Access (VOA) process issue that
        has since been corrected in patch DG*5.3*950. 
   
 Enhancement #3
 HC IdM has requested an enhancement to the DOD Activity Checker process
 that will allow additional information from the Patient Treatment File
 (PTF) [#45] to be returned, which will assist them in their analysis of
 these reported activities when they occur. The PTF information returned
 from the DOD Activity Check in routine MPIFDODC has been enhanced to now
 append the following text to the results:
  
                  "PTF file (#45) IEN=nnn" 
  
  Note: nnn will be replaced with the Internal Entry Number (IEN) of the
        PTF (#45) record entry.
  
 Enhancement #4
 HC IdM has requested that MVI enhance the Register a Patient [DG REGISTER
 PATIENT] menu option so that deceased patients are easily identifiable in
 the returned search results. The marking of 'DECEASED' patient records
 should result in a decrease of the number of possible wrong selections made
 by users. Therefore, 'DECEASED' patients will now be marked with a
 proceeding asterisk (*) in the search results and on the Date of Death (DOD)
 when a request is made to display the details of a deceased patient. 
 Finally, if the returned search list includes 'DECEASED' patients, then MVI
 will also add the following disclaimer after the search results alerting the
 user to the presence of deceased patients:
  
           *Candidate list includes a deceased patient

 The MPIF back-out procedure would consist of restoring the original
 routines using the back-up message created during the patch installation,
 as there are no additional components nor any other data modifications
 being made in this patch.
   
      Note: This process should only be done with the concurrence and
            participation of the development team and the appropriate
            VA Site/Region personnel.
