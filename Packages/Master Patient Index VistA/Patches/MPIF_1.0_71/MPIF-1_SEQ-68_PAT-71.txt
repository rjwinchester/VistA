Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ENHANCEMENTS - EHRM SUPPORT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems or the FORUM CLAIMS system (since it is NOT a
       Veterans Affair Medical Center (VAMC) VistA system).
  
 MPIF*1.0*61 and DG*5.3*981 are the required builds for patch
 MPIF*1.0*71.
    
 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) 'EHRM (Electronic Health Record
       Modernization) SUPPORT' enhancements are being distributed
       in four VistA namespaces: DG, MPIF, RG and XU.
       The only build enforced requirement is that:
         - DG*5.3*981 be installed before MPIF*1.0*71.
       
       **Note: Patches RG*1.0*72 and XU*8.0*710 can be installed
               in any order as there are NO dependencies to these
               other patches.
       
       (Do NOT install MPIF*1.0*71 or RG*1.0*72 on legacy sites or
        on the FORUM CLAIMS system)
  
 NOTE: Legacy sites and the FORUM CLAIMS system can install just the
       DG*5.3*981 and XU*8.0*710 patches. MPIF*1.0*71 and RG*1.0*72
       should NOT be installed on legacy sites or on the FORUM CLAIMS
       system.   
  
 The following enhancement exported in this patch is needed to
 support the transition of sites to the EHRM (CERNER) application.  
  
 Enhancement
 To support EHRM during the creation of patients that have potential
 matching Department of Defense (DoD) records being returned for
 selection in Enterprise Registration, an additional entry labeled
 'selectedIdentifier' will be transmitted in the eXtensible Markup
 Language (XML) explicit 'ADD' message to MPI upon creation of the
 patient at the site. The 'selectedIdentifier' entry will contain
 one of the following values below to identify the existing record
 that was selected from Enterprise Registration if applicable:
  
    - "" 
         Null if no results returned or nothing selected from results.
    - "<EDIPI>^NI^200DOD^USDOD"
         (DoD's) Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier 
         (EDIPI) if a DoD record was selected from the results list.
    - "<ICN>^NI^200M^USVHA"
         Integration Control Number (ICN) if any other Non-DoD record
         was selected from the results list.
  
 NOTE: The identifier value will be determined/created in routine
       DPTLK7 and then added to the XML message for transmission to
       the MPI in routine MPIFXMLI.
