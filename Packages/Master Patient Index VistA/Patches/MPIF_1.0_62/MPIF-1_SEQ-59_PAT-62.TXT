Description:
============

 *************************************************************************
 * This patch may be installed with users on the system, however we      *
 * strongly advise it be installed after business hours.                 *
 ************************************************************************* 
  
 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems.
  
 MPIF*1.0*20 and MPIF*1.0*61 are required builds for patch MPIF*1.0*62.
  
 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) enhancements are being distributed in
       three VistA namespaces: DG, RG and MPIF.
       The enhancements related to this patch are only being distributed in
       the DG and MPIF VistA namespaces. MPIF*1.0*62 should be installed
       before DG*5.3*919 for non-legacy sites, as the new Swipe/Scan 
       functionality being exported in these patches will not work without 
       MPIF*1.0*62. (Do NOT install MPIF*1.0*62 on legacy sites.)
       Therefore it is recommended that these patches be installed in the
       following order on non-legacy sites: 
              MPIF*1.0*62 and then DG*5.3*919.
  
       DG*5.3*919 should be installed immediately after installing
       MPIF*1.0*62. 
  
 Enhancement
 This enhancement patch provides support for patch DG*5.3*919. It updates
 routines MPIFRPC and MPIFAPI to provide backend support and also an 
 application programmer interface (API) to the REGISTRATION (DG) package
 that will allow Veteran Health Information Card (VHIC) and the Department
 of Defense's (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC) swipe and scan information to
 be temporarily stored on the local Veterans Health Information System and Technology Architecture (VistA) system, until retrieved from the central
 Master Patient Index (MPI) system.
  
 To allow the MPI system to retrieve the locally stored VHIC/CAC data from
 the ^XTMP("MPIFCARD") global location during its nightly background
 processing, a new remote procedure call (RPC) MPIF GET VHIC/CAC CARD DATA
 was created. In addition, upon successful retrieval, MPI will then purge
 all of the retrieved VHIC/CAC information from the local VistA system
 using the RPC MPIF PURGE VHIC/CAC CARD DATA.
     
 Issue
 In addition, it was noted by development that after the release of patch
 MPIF*1.0*61 the patient's middle name was not being displayed in the
 results list when the REGISTER A PATIENT [DG REGISTER PATIENT] menu
 option was executed. So routine MPIFVER was updated to also display the
 patient's middle name which will give users the ability to more 
 accurately select the correct patient and if needed view the most
 appropriate extended search data to verify the correct patient is being
 selected when registering through this menu option.

 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the

     number (i.e. MPIF*1.0*62):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
