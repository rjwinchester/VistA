Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ISSUES - ITERATION 12

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems.
  
 MPIF*1.0*52, MPIF*1.0*54, and MPIF*1.0*57 are required builds for 
 patch MPIF*1.0*59.
  
 NOTE: The messaging enhancements for the new SELF IDENTIFIED GENDER
       (#.024) field in the PATIENT (#2) File are being distributed
       in three VistA namespaces: DG, RG and MPIF. The patches should
       be installed in the following order: DG*5.3*876, RG*1.0*61, 
       and then MPIF*1.0*59. After installing DG*5.3*876, it is not
       necessary to wait for the bulletin from the queued Master 
       Patient Index (MPI) Employee data seeding process to complete 
       before moving on with installing RG*1.0*61. However, it is 
       recommended that these three patches be installed within a
       short time window, preferably on the same date if possible.
  
 Issue #1
 To address Remedy ticket INC000000866833, modifications were made
 to the routine, MPIFA24, to insert an "@" value when handling a null
 Coordinating Master of Record (CMOR) passed value. This will ensure
 that the Health Level Seven (HL7) A24 link event message is
 processed correctly.
  
 Issue #2
 Enhancements were made to the ADT-A08 and ACK-A31 HL7 messages sent
 to the MPI to include the following fields from the PATIENT File 
 (#2):
   - SELF IDENTIFIED GENDER (#.024)
   - PERIOD OF SERVICE (#.323)
   - TYPE (#391)
   - VETERAN (Y/N)? (#1901) 
 VETERAN (Y/N)? (#1901) and TYPE (#391) will be located on the ZEL
 segment, PERIOD OF SERVICE (#.323) will be located on the ZSP 
 segment, and SELF IDENTIFIED GENDER (#.024) will be located on the
 OBX segment of the HL7 message.
  
 Issue #3
 To address Remedy tickets INC000000985002 and INC000000987377,
 reported by the Veteran Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs), 
 modifications were made to the MPIFSA2 routine to ensure that the
 correct Integration Control Number (ICN) value is displayed to 
 the user upon execution of the Display Only Query, [MPIF DISPLAY 
 ONLY QUERY TO MPI], menu option.
   
 Issue #4
 Modifications were made to the ADT-A08 and ACK-A31 Health Level 
 Seven (HL7) messages sent to the MPI to accurately capture the name
 fields entered or edited in VistA. 
   - The ADT-A08 HL7 message has included an OBX segment which will
     contain the NAME field (#.01) of the PATIENT File (#2), and the
     FAMILY (LAST) LAST NAME (#1), GIVEN (FIRST) NAME (#2), MIDDLE 
     NAME (#3), SUFFIX (#5), and PREFIX (#4) fields of the NAME 
     COMPONENTS File (#20).
   - The ACK-A31 HL7 application acknowledgement sent to the MPI in
     response to an ADT-A31 will include an ERR segment with the
     same data, Patient Name and Name Components, as described in
     the ADT-A08 HL7 message above.
