Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ENHANCEMENTS - SUPPORT LONG NAMES IN VA MPI

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Other

Description:
============

 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems or the FORUM CLAIMS system (since it is NOT a
       Veterans Affair Medical Center (VAMC) VistA system).
  
 There are NO required builds for patch MPIF*1.0*69.
    
 NOTE: Master Patient Index (MPI) 'Support for Long Names in VA MPI'
       enhancements are being distributed in three VistA namespaces:
       DG, MPIF and RG.
       The only build enforced requirement for this set of related
       patches is that MPIF*1.0*69 be installed before RG*1.0*71.
       
       (Do NOT install MPIF*1.0*69 or RG*1.0*71 on legacy sites
        or on the FORUM CLAIMS system)
  
 NOTE: Legacy sites and the FORUM CLAIMS system can install just the
       DG*5.3*974 patch. MPIF*1.0*69 and RG*1.0*71 should NOT be
       installed on legacy sites or on the FORUM CLAIMS system. 
  
 The following enhancement exported in this patch was needed to support
 the collection of the patient's legal name in the Veteran Affairs (VA)
 Master Person Index, which requires MPI to support storing patient
 names and aliases greater than the VistA maximum of 30 characters in
 length.  
  
 Enhancement
 MPI as of patch MPI*1.0*125 will start supporting the collection of
 an individual's legal name, which can now exceed VistA's limitation of
 a maximum length of 30 characters on the name and/or alias fields. To
 support this change on the MPI, VistA has been modified with the
 following change so that it will NOT outright reject the value for
 exceeding the 30-character maximum length:
  
   Created a new Remote Procedure Call (RPC) [MPIF UPDATE NAME COMP
   FLAG] that will allow MPI to remotely retrieve and update the new
   Name Components flag stored in the MPI ICN BUILD MANAGEMENT 
   (#984.8) file, LAST PATIENT BUILT field (#3). This field value will
   be stored in the new file entry identified as 'THREE' (NAME .01)
   and will control how names passed in the Health Level Seven (HL7)
   Admit Discharge Transfer (ADT) A31 (Update Person) messages are
   processed.
  
    - NEW Name Components Flag is set to 0 or Null:
      
          The component parts of the name in the HL7 message are used
          to build a name, possibly shortened to 30 characters and
          filed into the PATIENT (#2) file NAME (#.01) field. The same
          process is true for aliases in that the component parts of
          any aliases are used to build the alias, possibly shortened
          to 30 characters and filed into the ALIAS (#1) multiple
          NAME (#.01) field in the PATIENT (#2) file.
       
          Note: The existing ANAM01 MUMPS cross-reference (X-REF) on the
                NAME (#.01) field and the ANAM201 X-REF on the ALIAS (#1)
                multiple NAME (#.01) field on the PATIENT (#2) file will
                continue to update the corresponding NAME COMPONENTS (#20)
                entry with the name components passed in the ADT-A31
                Person Update HL7 message.
      
    - NEW Name Components Flag is set to 1:
  
          The component parts of the name or alias in the HL7 message are
          filed directly into the NAME COMPONENTS (#20) file.
      
          Note: The existing ANAME MUMPS X-REF on the fields in the NAME
                COMPONENTS (#20) file will continue to update the source
                field [NAME (#.01) field or ALIAS (#1) multiple NAME (#.01)
                field in the PATIENT (#2) file] with the formatted name.
