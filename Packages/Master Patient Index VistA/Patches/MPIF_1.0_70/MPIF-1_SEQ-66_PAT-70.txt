Subject: MASTER VETERAN VISTA ENHANCEMENTS - REMOTE UPDATES FOR CLOUD

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 NOTE: To prevent legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities,
       RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy 
       systems or the FORUM CLAIMS system (since it is NOT a
       Veterans Affair Medical Center (VAMC) VistA system).
  
 MPIF*1.0*63 is the only required build for patch MPIF*1.0*70.
   
 NOTE: Do NOT install MPIF*1.0*70 on legacy sites or on the 
       FORUM CLAIMS system. 
  
 The following enhancement exported in this patch will allow the
 Master Veteran Index (MVI) to now remotely update the Internet
 Protocol (IP) Address and the associated Secure Socket Layer Port
 for the existing Web Service that utilizes the Hypertext Transport
 Protocol Secure (HTTPS) communication link to the Person Service
 Identity Management (PSIM) system.   
   
 Enhancement
 MVI has further enhanced the existing Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
 [MPI VISTA HWS CONFIG] through the inclusion of 2 NEW 'Optional'
 parameters that will allow MVI to remotely update the following
 additional fields for the "MPI_PSIM_NEW EXECUTE" Web Service in
 the WEB SERVER (#18.12) file:
  
      -  .04 SERVER
      - 3.03 SSL PORT
  
 These changes introduced into the RPC and the associated routine
 'MPIFWSC' are needed to allow MVI to quickly adapt to and update
 the IP and Port Number configuration settings for the PSIM system
 identified in the Web Service entry "MPI_PSIM_NEW EXECUTE" at the
 VistA sites when and wherever it is migrated to the Cloud.
 Ultimately, this remote capability enhancement will result in
 minimal downtime and/or issues being reported/experienced by the
 sites during the relocation of this system into the Cloud.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There are no Pre/Post installation routine processes.    
   
   
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 ----------------------------- 
 This patch takes less than a minute to install. This patch may be 
 installed with users on the system. NO OPTIONs or PROTOCOLs are
 required to be disabled. The HL7 filers do NOT need to be stopped.
   
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
   
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch 
     number (i.e. MPIF*1.0*70):
   
     a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
     b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
     c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch, such as
         routines, DDs, templates, etc.
     d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
   
 5.  If prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of

 Back-Out Plan
 -------------
 The MPIF back-out procedure would primarily consist of restoring the
 original routine using the back-up message created during the patch
 installation. Upon coordination with the MVI development team, the
 original RPC [MPI VISTA HWS CONFIG] can be provided to remove the 2
 optional parameters from the definition.
    
      Note: This process should only be done with the concurrence and
            participation of the development team and the appropriate
            VA Site/Region personnel.
