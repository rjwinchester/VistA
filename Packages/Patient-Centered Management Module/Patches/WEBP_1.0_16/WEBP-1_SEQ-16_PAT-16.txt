Subject: PCMM WEB V1.16 CONFIGURATION UPDATES

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application version 
 WEBP*1*16 will implement the following configuration changes to current 
 functionality that will reduce errors received by users and allow the 
 system to function more efficiently.
  
  
 Configuration and Software Changes:
 ===================================
 1. RTC 646433 - The CPRS Window displays the staff name of the PACT 
 Clinical Pharmacist correctly but displays the PACT Clinical Pharmacist 
 staff name in the Surrogate Care Manager's team role instead of 
 displaying the Surrogate Care Manager's staff name. The CPRS Window 
 template [PCMM].[PCM_STD_TEMPLATE] was updated in the DB to show correct 
 staff name for the Surrogate Care Manager. 
 NOTE: This is documenting the DB change to the CPRS Window template that 
 has already been implemented in production.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 2. RTC 639349 - During a position reassignment when writing a patient's 
 position assignment back to VistA for a primary care team assignment that 
 was migrated in from VistA but the position assignment was not part of 
 the migration but created in PCMM Web after migration, the Primary Care 
 flag in VistA does not correctly calculate the field (#.05) for PC ROLE 
 in the Patient Team Position Assignment file (#404.43). The Java code was 
 changed to calculate the Primary Care flag value if the position 
 assignment date is after the sites migration date.
 CA-SDM Ticket: I9863622FY16
  
 3. RTC 650678 - Primary Care - Home Based Primary Care (PC-HBPC) team 
 assignments with explicit patient assignments to certain team roles 
 causes CPRS Window to display "PCMM is Unavailable." with cached data, if 
 available, to the users when trying to open the CPRS Window for 
 assignment details. Any assignment to the following team roles on HBPC 
 teams will result in the CPRS window errors:
 Medical Director
 MH Provider
 Registered Dietician
 Rehabilitation Therapist
 Social Worker
 Surrogate Medical Director
 Work around - unassign patients from these team positions and CPRS Window 
 should display correctly. The Java code was changed where the data 
 structures are calculated in the PatientSunnaryBuilderImpl.java to avoid 
 a nullpointerexception.
 CA-SDM Ticket: 
 I17978523FY18   I18153962FY18   I18153999FY18   I18385975FY18
  
 4. RTC 652251 - Need to remove CANCELED Primary Care assignments from the 
 criteria for the validator that checks for duplicate assignments to the 
 same team. Users receive a validation error that the patient cannot be 
 assigned to the same team even if the patient is not actively assigned 
 but had a previously CANCELED PENDING PACT assignment to that same team. 
 This validator validates duplicate ACTIVE and PENDING assignments but 
 also included CANCELED assignments. Removed CANCELED assignments from the 
 validation criteria for the PatientAssignmentServiceImpl.java validator.
 NOTE: Validation error received by users - "The patient "xxx" is assigned 
 to the team "xxx" more than once for the same time range."

 I18414193FY18   I18483059FY18
  
  
 5. RTC 662329 - The system needs to properly display the parent|child 
 station names for primary care assignments in the CPRS header. The code 
 was updated that calculates local station display to use proper station 
 relationships.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 6. RTC 652288 - On the PCMM Web Home page, the user of a screen reading 
 software application hears "Department of Veterans Affairs logo" instead 
 of "Department of Veterans Affairs seal". The wording was changed in the 
 ciss_header.jsp file to read Seal instead of Logo.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
 NOTE: This is Issue #3 from Section 508 ID tracking number of 23605.
  
 7. RTC 652298 - In the PCMM Web application on the List all Teams screen, 
 the screen reader does not recognize the individual filter categories.  
 The user of a screen reading software hears "Combo box all" instead of 
 "Care Type Combo box all" or "Focus Combo box all".etc. The filter (all) 
 item was changed to read and display the column heading for clarity in 
 the commonJavascript.js file.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
 NOTE: This is Issue #6 from Section 508 ID tracking number of 23605.

 1.  I9863622FY16 - PCMM Issue assigned as Non-Primary Care (Memphis 614)
     
 Problem:
 During a position reassignment when writing a patient's position 
 assignment back to VistA for a primary care team assignment that was 
 migrated in from VistA but the position assignment was not part of the 
 migration but created in PCMM Web after migration, the Primary Care flag 
 in VistA does not correctly calculate the field (#.05) for PC ROLE in the 
 Patient Team Position Assignment file (#404.43). 
  
 Resolution:
 The Java code was changed to calculate the Primary Care flag value if the 
 position assignment date is after the sites migration date.

 PatientSunnaryBuilderImpl.java to avoid a nullpointerexception.
