Subject: PCMM WEB V1.13 CONFIGURATION UPDATES

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application version 
 WEBP*1*13 will implement the following configuration changes to current 
 functionality that will reduce errors received by users and allow the 
 system to function more efficiently.
  
  
 Configuration and Software Changes:
 ===================================
  
 1. RTC 508111 - Designated Women's Health Provider (DWHP) and 
 Physician Attending team roles are not included in the MPACT Request 
 "Clinical Approver" list so they can approve these requests. Added DWHP 
 and Physician Attending team roles to the "Clinical Approver" list so 
 they can now approve MPACT Requests. 
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 2. RTC 428602 - Some teams in PCMM Web display a "Last VistA Sync 
 Date" of "NEVER." Changed the JAVA code to increase the call timeout by a 
 factor of 10 when invoking FINDER which should return the largest dataset 
 found in VistA without hitting the call timeout limit.
 CA-SDM Ticket: R12336516FY17
  
 3. RTC 386177 - Need to optimize a DB query execution to reduce 
 number of calls to function "patientDAO.findByICN()" during the MVI 
 Registration process. Added "caching" to the DB query for found patients 
 to reduce number of patient searches by ICN. 
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.  
  
 4. RTC 464403 - CPRS Header Sync job is not triggered to 
 re-sync/re-calculate the CPRS header when a patient has a Date of Death 
 (DOD) OR an approved Multi-PACT (MPACT) where the PACT assignment flipped 
 to ACTIVE. Added JAVA code triggers the re-sync of the CPRS header when a 
 MPACT request is approved and the PACT assignment dispositions to ACTIVE. 
 When the patient is DOD, the unassignment from the PACT team will trigger 
 the CPRS header re-sync. 
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 5. RTC 284047 - Preceptee/Preceptor relationship is failing in 
 production. All preceptor/preceptee relationships were reviewed/corrected 
 in the DB to ensure functionality works as expected for all 
 preceptor/preceptee relationships in production.
 CA-SDM Ticket:  No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 6. RTC 453491 - The Team roles of Designated Women's Health 
 Providers (DWHP) and Physician-Attending (Phy-Attd) need to auto precept 
 the Nurse Practitioner Associate Provider (NPAP) and Physician Assistant 
 Associate Provider (PAAP) team roles. The DB was updated with the 
 preceptor/preceptee relationships for Designated Womens Health Providers 
 (DWHP) and Physician-Attending (Phy-Attd) to allow these team roles to 
 precept the Nurse Practitioner Associate Provider (NPAP) and Physician 
 Assistant Associate Provider (PAAP) team roles.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 7. RTC 464377 - Need to display PACT Clinical Pharmacist, Surrogate 
 Primary Care Provider (PCP) and Surrogate Care Manager (CM) team roles, 
 only when staffed, in the CPRS window below the core teamlet roles. This 
 will apply to REMOTE PACT assignments also. Added data to the JAVA 
 template object and the template in DB so these team roles will display 
 in the CPRS window when staffed.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 8. RTC 464393 - Need to display a Non-VA Care care type team 
 assignment in the CPRS window regardless of an association to a Non-VA 
 Provider. Removed filter from code that builds specialty teams data to 
 include Non-VA team assignments so this team assignment will display in 
 the CPRS window even if the patient is not assigned to a Non-VA Provider. 
 This team assignment will display in the specialty team (SP:) section of 
 the window.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 9. RTC 319916 - PCMM Web would not allow the user to assign a 
 patient to another team when the patient had an approved MPACT and a PACT 
 assignment in another 3-digit station. Since MPACT Request are good for 2 
 years, a new PACT team assignment within the same 3-digit station will be 
 appended the existing APPROVED MPACT Request when the patient is assigned 
 to a different PACT team.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 10. RTC 501875 - Team IENs changing is breaking VSSC reports. Changed 
 the JAVA code to save a team's IEN right after saving a team's 
 information in VistA to minimize the chance that setting IEN fails.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 11. RTC 504366 - "FOCUS 2" in the Primary Care (PC) care type should 
 not be considered in the Modeled Team Capacity calculations. Removed 
 "FOCUS 2" from the logic that determines if the capacity should be 
 modeled or not so it will not be considered.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue. 
  
 12. RTC 508830 - Do not allow the user to extend a PACT assignment 
 scheduled for auto-inactivation when the PACT assignment is outside the 
 users logged in station. Removed "Extend" action link on the assignments 
 to PACT team(s) in stations other than the one the user is logged in to.

 Resolution:
 Changed the JAVA code to increase the call timeout by a factor of 10 when 
 invoking FINDER which should return the largest dataset found in VistA 
 without hitting the call timeout limit.
