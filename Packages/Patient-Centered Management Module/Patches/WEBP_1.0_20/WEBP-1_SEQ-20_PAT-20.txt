Subject: PCMM WEB V1.20 CONFIGURATION UPDATES

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application version 
 WEBP*1*20 will implement the following configuration changes to current 
 functionality that will reduce errors received by users and allow the 
 system to function more efficiently.
  
  
 Configuration and Software Changes:
 ===================================
  
 1. RTC 822552 - The TRM upgrade of Spring Framework caused the treatment 
 of transactions to fail for the "Validate Team Data Consistency" link on 
 the team profile screen which validates team integrity from the user 
 interface.
 The following error is received when debugging the issue: 
 "javax.persistence.TransactionRequiredException: No EntityManager with 
 actual transaction available for current thread - cannot reliably process 
 'refresh' call" which is eaten and call returns immediately. The 
 Javascript files 
 C":\data\projects-hp\PCMMR\trunk\web\src\main\java\gov\va\med\pcmm\web\tea
 m\TeamController.java" added transactional annotation to allow the 
 validation link to evaluate and display validation errors for the team as 
 expected.
 ServiceNow Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 2. RTC 811695:  The INFORMATIONAL alerts R2, R5, R6, R20, R23, R24, R26 
 received within PCMM Web needs to be clearer for the PCMM Coordinators 
 and Traveling Veteran Coordinators (TVCs). The following alert rules 
 verbiage was changed in the properties file 
 C:\data\projects-hp\PCMMR\trunk\web\src\main\resources\messages_en.propert
 ies as requested so these alerts are clearer to the users in PCMM Web.
 ServiceNow Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 Alert rules changes are listed below:
 R2 - Change from:

 assignment at station "xxx" has been DENIED. The Multiple PACT request is 
 now closed.
 Change to:

 station "xxx". The Multiple PACT request is now closed.
  
 R20 - Change from:
 A multiple PACT approval request for patient "XX" for a Primary Care team 
 assignment at station "XXX" has been pending for "15" days. Please 
 provide your approve/deny decision as soon as possible.

 WITHDRAWN.
 Change to:
 MPACT WITHDRAWN/COMPLETED RELOCATION for patient "xxx" relocation to 
 station "xxx".  The Multiple PACT request at station "xxx" is being

 3. RTC 756552 - The business office requested that the Intensity Score 
 from Modeled Capacity Calculations throughout application needs to be 
 modified to not influence the calculation results for modeled team 
 capacity calculations. The following changes were implemented to 
 calculate the intensity score at a value of 1.0 throughout the 
 application:
 a. Update station intensity UI to make value read-only, so users can not 
 override it.
 b. Update database to make intensity station 1.0 so it does not change 
 modeled capacity.
 c. Change patient to always return patient intensity of 1.0 
 irrespectively of database values so it does not change modeled capacity.
 ServiceNow Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
