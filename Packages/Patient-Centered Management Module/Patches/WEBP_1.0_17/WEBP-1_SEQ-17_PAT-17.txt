Subject: PCMM WEB V1.17 CONFIGURATION UPDATES

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application version 
 WEBP*1*17 will implement the following configuration changes to current 
 functionality that will reduce errors received by users and allow the 
 system to function more efficiently.
  
  
 Configuration and Software Changes:
 ===================================
  
 1. RTC 652295 - During tab navigation on the Select/Change Station page, 
 the screen reading software announces Clinical Information Support System 
 "CISS/CISS link" but the link is not visible. The CISS home page was 
 hidden using the AppPageBacking.java file.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
 NOTE: This is Issue #4 from Section 508 ID tracking number of 23605.
  
 2. RTC 652297 - The screen reading software does not announce the error 
 message alert on the Search for Patient screen. The message text was 
 wrapped into HTML ANCOR so it can receive focus in the attentionDialog.js 
 file.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
 NOTE: This is Issue #5 from Section 508 ID tracking number of 23605.
  
 3. RTC 652300 - The screen reader does not recognize all of the required 
 fields within the application. The JAVA code was changed in many files to 
 ensure the screen reader recognizes all of the required fields within 
 PCMM Web.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
 NOTE: This is Issue #7 from Section 508 ID tracking number of 23605.
  
 4. RTC 652301 - The screen reader does not announce the complete label 
 for radio button in the Patient Capacity section of the Create a Team 
 page. Added screen reader specific enabler tabs to make radio buttons 
 more user-friendly in the inc_teamDetailsCapacity.jsp file.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
 NOTE: This is Issue #8 from Section 508 ID tracking number of 23605.
  
 5. RTC 652302 - The screen reader does not announce the collapse button 
 on the Open Alert List for Current Station page. When the user of a 
 screen reader clicks on the "expand (+) button", the "collapse (-) 
 button" is not announced. The Java code was updated to include code to:
    a. To force button to accept focus on 
    b. To process keyboard enter events the same way as clicks in the
       inc_jqueryTable.jsp file.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
 NOTE: This is Issue #9 from Section 508 ID tracking number of 23605.
  
 6. RTC 652304 - The text color that appears on Select/Change Station page 
 does not meet sufficient color contrast. Created 2 new buttons for better 
 color contrast and added to the tab_nav_pcmm_off.jpg file.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
 NOTE: This is Issue #10 from Section 508 ID tracking number of 23605.
  
 7. RTC 662546 - There is a misconfiguration in Hibernate form 
 configuration that causes an orphan user role assignment records in the 
 DB. Modified the field definitions to remove orphan records in the 
 user.orm.xml file. 
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 8. RTC 674853 - A valid encounter is not applied to the patient's primary 
 care team assignment due to position transfers where the Associate 
 Provider (AP) on the encounter was not assigned to the AP position at
 the time of encounter. A validator check was removed from the
 Auto-Inactivation (AI) code that flips assignments to ACTIVE in the
 PatientAssignmentServiceImpl.java and 
 PatientAutoInactivationServiceImpl.java files.
 CA-SDM Ticket: R18686097FY18
  
 9. RTC 682332 - A slow running query that is causing locks in the Database
 (DB) needs to be optimized by adding the STA3n to the where clause for
 partitioning optimization. The code and query were updated to use STA3n 
 in the where clause for partitioning optimization when possible in the 
 PatientPositionAssignmentDAO.java file.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 10. RTC 682238 - When an ACTIVE PACT assignment is back dated prior to 
 the CANCELED assignment START DATE due to encounter dates, the INACTIVE 
 assignment does not show in the Historical Assignment section as INACTIVE 
 but the previous CANCELLED assignment is displayed. If a patient has a 
 CANCELLED and an INACTIVE assignment to the same PACT team, the code was 
 modified in the PatientController.java file to show the last INACTIVE 
 assignment regardless of the CANCELLED assignment so the user is able to 
 revert the PACT team assignment if needed.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
