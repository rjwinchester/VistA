Subject: PATIENT-CENTERED MANAGEMENT MODULE (PCMM) WEB

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This is the informational patch for the release of the new 
 Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application.
  
 RELEASE INFORMATION:
 PCMM Web is a portlet that runs inside the Clinical Information Support 
 System (CISS) portal.  The Clinical Information Support System (CISS) is 
 a web-based portal application that provides a central interface for 
 users to access information and applications necessary for their role. 
 The applications accessed through CISS are called partner systems.  PCMM 
 Web is a partner system to CISS.
  
 In order to fully support a team based, patient-centric approach to 
 healthcare delivery, enhancements to PCMM have been developed which allow 
 a team to be formed and aligned around a patient. These, include 
 providers residing in multiple VA sites and in non-VA settings to enable 
 care coordination and communication.   The software supports automated 
 data collection for management metrics and analysis related to access, 
 workload, and panel management.  VHA's model of team-based care is known 
 as the Patient-Aligned Care Team (PACT).  The goal is to evolve and 
 replace existing PCMM software with functionality that identifies all 
 team members and specialists (VA and non-VA) involved in the care of the 
 patient, as well as their contact information and provide modalities to 
 facilitate provider-provider communication.  This new PACT Management 
 Module is known as PCMM Web.  According to the PCMM Modification 
 Workgroup, the relationship between the patient and his/her Primary Care 
 Provider (PCP) will help to enhance patient care and the treatment 
 process.  Patients who regularly visit the same PCP receive better 
 healthcare and utilize fewer healthcare resources because of the PCP's 
 ability to treat patients more efficiently and effectively.
  
 There are three VistA patches associated with release of PCMM Web.  These 
 patches are required and support PCMM Web interactions with VistA and 
 CPRS.
