Subject: PATIENT-CENTERED MANAGEMENT MODULE (PCMM) WEB APPLICATION, VERSION 1.2

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application version 
 WEBP-1.2 provides several upgrades and enhancements for the national
 release of PCMM Web.
   
 Enhancements:
 ==============
  
 NON-VA CARE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Functionality to capture non-va care has been added in WEBP*1*2.
 Provide the ability to capture, view, and manage Non-VA Providers that are
 providing Non-VA Care (formerly Fee Basis) to the patient through the VA. 
 Non-VA Care consists of three categories:
  -Veteran's Choice
  -Community Nursing Home
  -Veteran State Home 
  
 New Menus in PCMM Web will allow a user to search for Non-VA Providers 
 and Non-VA practices. Users will be required to assign a Non-VA Practice
 to a Non-VA Provider and then to the patient. 
  
 The user is given an option to assign the patient to a special care type
 PACT team, "Non-VA Care", to allow a Care Coordinator to manage the
 population of patients receiving Non-VA Care paid for by the VA.
  
  
 All other Non-VA provider assignments to patients with other Specialties,
 except Primary Care, will only be displayed in the CPRS Window no changes 
 to current functionality.  the current functionality of capturing and 
 displaying Private Sector and DOD Non-VA Providers is still available to 
 the user thru the new Non-VA Providers process.
  
  
 HOME BASED PRIMARY CARE
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 Provide the ability to remove Home Based Primary Care (HBPC) as a FOCUS 
 of the care type "Primary Care" and created a new specialty care type of 
 "Primary Care - HBPC". This care type functions as a special Primary Care 
 PACT team that will not follow the same validation rules as a Primary 
 Care PACT team and will have no pending status. Assignment to this care 
 type will be "Active" automatically without using encounters. A patient 
 will only be assigned to either a PC PACT team or a PC-HBPC PACT team at 
 any given time within the same 3 digit station code. This new 
 functionality allows this special PACT team to display in the CPRS header 
 the same as for PC PACT teams by indicating the team name and the 
 assigned PCP and AP, if assigned. In the CPRS window, a new tag will 
 appear indicating this new care type of "Primary Care - HBPC" by using 
 the tag of "HBPC:" instead of "PACT:".
  
 FORTIFY
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Fortify SCAN Updates: Non-functional updates were made to the PCMM
 application to remediate security scan findings, no functional changes
 were required.
