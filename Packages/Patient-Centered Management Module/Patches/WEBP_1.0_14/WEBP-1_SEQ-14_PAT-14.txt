Subject: PCMM WEB V1.14 CONFIGURATION UPDATES

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application version 
 WEBP*1*14 will implement the following configuration changes to current 
 functionality that will reduce errors received by users and allow the 
 system to function more efficiently.
  
  
 Configuration and Software Changes:
 ===================================
 1. RTC 514210 - Change code that parses encounters in the AI process to 
 not fail if any of the fields #2 - #14 are missing. Checks have been 
 added to the parse process for fields #2-#14 to use an empty value in 
 parsing if the field is absent.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 2. RTC 515527 - When a user resends a MPACT approval alert, only the 
 Traveling Veteran Coordinator (TVC) that have not provided an approval 
 should receive the alert instead of all TVC(s) to include those that have 
 previously provided an approval. Changed the code to remove role based 
 recipients from resend list at the sites that have already approved the 
 request.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 3. RTC 523521 - During the auto-inactivation (AI) process, the process 
 should exclude encounters that occur prior to the Start Date of a
 patient's PACT team assignment from being applied to an existing
 assignment. Modify code to use the assignment Start Date to determine
 encounter validity in the AI Process.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 4. RTC 323054 - CPRS displays the 3 digit parent station number versus 
 the 5 digit parent station number for integrated sites. Changed the code 
 and corresponding Velocity template in the Data Base (DB) to use the
 integrated facilities 5 digit parent station number when the 5 digit 
 station is the parent of another 5 digit station. If a 5 digit station 
 does not have a 5 digit parent station, the corresponding 3 digit station 
 number is used as the parent station.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 5. RTC 228203 - During staff unassignment or reassignment, bad historical 
 data was displayed when PCMM Web automatically adjusted any preceptor 
 timelines prior to transition. Modified the code to only adjust the 
 preceptor data after the site's official transition date to PCMM Web.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 6. RTC 291661 - For PC-HBPC teams, the PCP Position Profile should not 
 have the ability to check the Override Capacity checkbox in the Patient 
 Capacity section just like with PACT teams. Updated the query that 
 determines whether current team role/staff role combination can be 
 precepted from which availability of checkbox is derived for PACT team 
 roles.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 7. RTC 324206 - PCMM Web Staff Search results table needs to display 
 staff members that have a Status of "0" as inactivated/separated when 
 searching for staff members within Web. Updated code to use the active 
 flag instead of the separation date.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 8. RTC 219792 - PC-HBPC Team Assignment Invalid Effective Date Format 
 returns an error of ConversionFailedException.  A validation check was 
 added to prevent an invalid date entry upon submission of an assignment 
 for PC-HBPC. 
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 9. RTC 331989 - During staff reassignment, new staff are not updated with 
 the current Separation Date. Added code to the Staff Assignment screen to 
 display the Separation Date field if a staff member has a separation date.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 10. RTC 309261 - Remove the VistA date of death (DOD) fetch from the MVI 
 registration process. This process will be updated as part of the AI job.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 11. RTC 420321 - When searching for a Patient using the SSN, the 
 application is not finding the Patient in VistA. FORTIFY scan suggested 
 changing the "string" data type for the SSN field to "char array" type 
 for security reasons. After the change, "equals" method for the logic did 
 not work correctly which caused the defect. Changed the "equals" method 
 implementation to account for the data type change.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 12. RTC 503053 - The "Absolute-Send-Redirect-Filter", which handles 
 proper protocol scheme generation for URLs in the application, requires a
 modification for Performance Optimization. Changed the handling from 
 "Response" to "Request" which is much lighter in computing power 
 consumption which should result in increased performance.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 13. RTC 456016 - The VA staff email icon displays the staff member's 
 personal email address. Changed the code to only display emails from
 domain.ext domain or one of its subdomains.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 14. RTC 227226 - The Non-PACT Calendar does not allow the user to use the 
 tab key on Team Assignment pop up window. Changed the code to set the tab
 order to allow the tab key functions in the popup window.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 15. RTC 271501 - The Team Position list is not correctly sorting back to 
 the original display after clicking the sort dropdown arrow. Changed the 
 code to not save state if care type is PACT or HBPC.
 CA-SDM Ticket: I7135649FY16
  
 16. RTC 222821 - If a TVC is 'inactive' in User Management (UM) the TVC 
 should not be displayed in a newly created MPACT request. Changed the 
 code to remove inactive TVC(s) from list.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 17. RTC 291650 - The MPACT Escalation Alerts R20, 21, 22 are being sent 
 to Inactive Web users. Changed the code for these escalation alerts to
 check whether a user is ACTIVE or INACTIVE in the application and not send
 the alert if the user is INACTIVE.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 18. RTC 237055 - A provider with special character (') is showing as 
 "&#39;" in the reassign to patient drop down. Changed the code to

 20. RTC 260488 - During the Staff Reassignment process, the Details 
 section on the Staff Information screen contains a checkmark for Current 
 FTE that should not be displayed during this process. Removed the 
 checkmark beside the Current FTE in the Details section so it does not 
 display during the staff reassignment process.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 21. RTC 275983 - Non-VA Practice email validation issues when entering an 
 invalid email address. Changed the initial validation code to not allow 
 wrong email address to be saved.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 22. RTC 377430 - Manage Reference Data for the Non-VA Provider Role Name 
 link produces a "SQLGrammarException: could not extract ResultSet" error 
 when selecting a "Name" to edit. Changed the table name in the code to 
 correspond to the DB table name to prevent this error from occurring when 
 selecting a "Name" to edit.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 23. RTC 332938 - User cannot press the enter, spacebar or tab keys on the 
 pop up message that appears for no results found during a patient search.

 L+4 Name field.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 24. RTC 259965 - The white X that was available in the upper right corner

 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 28. RTC 422034 - MPACT 30 day (R21) and 45 day (R22) Escalation emails in 
 Outlook need to include the station number of the division that needs to 
 approve. The Email template already has a block to include required

 template to uncomment this code to fix the defect.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 29. RTC 508999 - Removed purge job from the application codebase as it

 31. RTC 552638 - First Encounter Date is not displayed as the Patient's 
 Start Date when the assignment flips to ACTIVE when the patient has no 
 other PACT assignments. Changed the order of adjusting the Start Date to
 accommodate the 60 day lookback process during the patient assignment

 may still not coincide with first Encounter Date.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 32. RTC 564599 - An ACTIVE PACT assignment is not inactivated when the 
 MPACT Request is approved if the encounter occurred before the MPACT was

 digit station.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
