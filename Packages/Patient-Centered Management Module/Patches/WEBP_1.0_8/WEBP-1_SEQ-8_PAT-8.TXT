Subject: PCMM WEB V1.8 CONFIG UPDATES AND FACILITY TYPE OF OTHER IMPLEMENTATION

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application version 
 WEBP*1*8 will implement the following configuration changes to current 
 functionality that will reduce errors received by users and allow the 
 system to function more efficiently.
  
  
 Configuration and Software Changes:
 ===================================
 RTC 371459 - If it is determined through discussion with user or a 
 helpdesk ticket that an individual team needs to be re-synced to update 
 the VistA files, then a managed operation is needed to force an immediate 
 VistA sync for this team. The published managed operation can be run by 
 an administrator in the Spring JMX console. PCMM Web will now provide the 
 ability to perform a direct VistA re-sync for a team that processes this 
 task immediately without placing the task in a nightly queue.
  
 CA-SDM Ticket:
 I10500809FY16           I10304183FY16           I10255346FY16
 I10036403FY16           I9959271FY16            R9969644FY16
 I9647449FY16            I10295361FY16           R10158431FY16
  
  
 RTC 361887 - Sites that have been waiting the longest in the Staff Update 
 job queue for staff updates need to be processed each night before all 
 other sites are processed. PCMM Web optimized the Staff update/refresh 
 job by changing the sort order with the oldest date in the queue to be 
 pulled to the top of the queue to process these sites before processing 
 other sites in the queue.
  
 CA-SDM Ticket:
 I10284528FY16
  
  
 RTC 330961 - PCMM Web needs to add an additional Facility Type of OTHER 
 so PCMM Web will include sites that are defined as OTHER in the 
 institution file in VistA and allow users to open these teams that 
 migrated in and process patient assignments. Facility Type of OTHER was 
 added and will now be displayed in PCMM Web in the Station login dropdown 
 box and the Create a Team station dropdown box. This allows the users to 
 log into this division and create new teams or open existing teams to 
 continue patient assignments.
  
 CA-SDM Ticket:
 I9016826FY16            I9964907FY16            I8934080FY16
  
  
 RTC 260518 - The auto-inactivation (AI) job runs nightly and needs to be 
 optimized to increase its reliability. The AI nightly job needs to be 
 changed to remove the repetition of completed steps when the process is 
 interrupted and restarted. The AI process will now keep track of the last 
 step completed and if this job is interrupted in the middle of processing 
 a site, it will only run the steps that are needed for completion upon 
 restarting the process. This will prevent this process from starting over 
 at step 1 and allow the process to complete tasks that were interrupted 
 more efficiently.
  
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 RTC 331958 - The Team Validation query is being executed excessively and 
 running for a long time causing DB locks to occur. A way to speed up the 
 run time of this query is needed to prevent further DB locks caused by 
 the continuing execution of this query. PCMM Web added a constraint to 
 optimize this query by using table partitioning efficiently. By using 
 table partitioning, this reduced the run time of the query by order of 
 magnitude.
  
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 RTC 374502 - The VistA sync process has a very inefficient piece of code 
 in the VistALink invocations that may slow down PCMM Web's VistALink 
 operations by a factor of 2. PCMM Web will now cache introduction text 
 that shows up in VistALink login window for 10 minutes and will use 
 cached data instead of querying VistA information on each VistALink 
 invocation.
  
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
