Subject: PCMM WEB V1.6 UPDATES

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application version 
 WEBP*1*6 will implement configuration changes to improve system 
 performance and corrects defects reported by sites who have completed 
 installation of PCMM Web. 
  
  
 Configuration and Software Changes:
 ===================================
 RTC 223851 - CPRS Window was displaying 'No PACT/HBPC assigned at any VA 
 location' when patient is assigned to PACT teams but should have been 
 displaying team assignments regardless of the location, The CPRS Window 
 will now display all of the patient's team assignments regardless of 
 location.

 I9342833FY16
  
 RTC 236423 - CPRS window was displaying REMOTE assignments before the 
 display of LOCAL assignments but should display REMOTE assignments after 
 all LOCAL assignments. CPRS Window will now display the REMOTE 
 assignments after all LOCAL assignments.
 CA-SDM Tickets:
 I8388448FY16
  
 RTC 259951 - When creating a New Position from the Team Position list, 
 the Expected FTE is not required but is displayed as a required field 
 (with a red asterisk) after creating the new position. The red asterisk 
 was removed since the Expected FTE is not required for the selected 
 position.
  
 RTC 283745- Patient Search was displaying duplicate patient names when a 
 patient is assigned to several positions on a HBPC team. Patient Search 
 will now only display one patient name entry even if the patient is 
 assigned to multiple positions on the same HBPC team.
  
 RTC 312190- The assigned Lead Coordinator staff member name was not 
 displaying correctly in the CPRS window and the assigned MHTC staff 
 member name was not displaying correctly in CPRS header. The patient's 
 assigned MHTC staff member name will now display in the CPRS header as 
 expected and the patient's assigned Lead Coordinator staff member name 
 will now display in the CPRS window as expected.
 CA-SDM Tickets:
 I8609399FY16
  
 RTC 174962- Find in VistA search stops when it reaches 500 records in a 
 staff search and some staff members are not returned in the VistA search 
 as expected, therefore they can't be pulled in to PCMM Web to be assigned 
 to a position. PCMM Web will now provide a more precise VistA search that 
 narrows the parameters so that the needed staff records are filtered more 
 precisely and appropriate records are included in the 500 records that 
 are returned then the appropriate staff can be selected and assigned.
 CA-SDM Tickets:
 R8875753FY16
  
 RTC 302823 - PCMM Web was not unassigning staff members, inactivating the 
 active positions and inactivating the team as expected when the user is 
 trying to inactivate a team after patients have been re-assigned to 
 another team. Users will need to use the "Add Entry" button to inactivate 
 a team in the Status Change Timeline section on the team profile screen 
 and then the VistA system will un-staff all active positions, inactivate
 all active positions and inactivate the team at one time.
  
 RTC 318621: The historical FTE assignments / values are included in the 
 Current FTE totals for assigned staff members but should not be included. 
 Historical FTE values from inactivated positions will no longer be 
 included when displaying the active staff member's current FTE count.
  
 RTC 309265 - When a staff member has a future termination date in VistA, 
 PCMM Web evaluates the termination date field to consider if a staff 
 member is active. However when a future date is entered in the field, Web 
 considered the staff member "separated" but should not and the staff 
 member could not be assigned. PCMM Web will now determine if a staff 
 member has been terminated by evaluating if the staff member is active or 
 inactive by evaluating the Status field in VistA. If the status is 
 active, the staff member will be pulled into Web even if a future 
 termination date is in VistA. In order to keep the termination dates 
 synced in PCMM Web and VistA, the Staff Update job has been updated to 
 run at 0430 ET.
 CA-SDM Tickets:
 I7865143FY16
  
 RTC 319529: The auto-inactivation (AI) jobs are running longer than 
 expected and get interrupted during nightly maintenance of the servers. 
 The AI jobs have been optimized to run faster and changed to sort and 
 prioritize sites that need to be moved to the top of the queue for 
 processing.
  
 RTC 203425 -The Provider FTE Report is including historical FTE values 
 for inactive teams and positions in the FTE VACANCY calculations and 
 column. The report has been changed to exclude all inactive teams and/or 
 positions from being displayed and the FTE values associated with the 
 inactive teams and/or positions will not be included in the calculations 
 that are provided in the report in the FTE Vacancy column.
  
 RTC 310928 - Alerts need to be archived. A process has been created to 
 archive alerts based on type and date created.  In the PCMM Web back-end 
 database, Informational Alerts will be removed from the CLOSED folder 
 after 30 days and placed in an archive folder and Actionable Alerts will 
 be removed from the CLOSED folder after 60 days and placed in an archive 
 folder. The closed informational archive folder will be purged after 1 
 year and the closed actionable archive folder will be purged after 2 
 years.

 RTC 226849 - PCMM Web is displaying validation errors with a different 
 patient and team message in the validator while assigning HBPC team to a 
 patient. The validator has been changed to restrict its behavior to just 
 the patient assignment being worked on so the error no longer appears for 
 other patients than the one being assigned to the HBPC team.
  
 RTC 303423 - When inactivating a Team in PCMM Web, the VistA files 404.58 
 Team History and 404.59 Team Position History are not updating the Status 
 Reason for the Team Inactivation.  Java code in PCMM Web has been updated 
 to synch back to VistA files for both 404.58 Team History and 404.59 Team 
 Position History where the correct Status Reason is displayed during Team 
 Inactivation and Reactivation.
  
 RTC 189952 - The Staff Assignment validator was not displaying an error 
 or warning message when a staff member had duplicate assignments. Updated 
 this validator to detect and flag duplicate assignments with the same 
 staff member, position and time.
  
 RTC 327602 - PCMM Web needs to add an additional Facility Type of MORC so 
 PCMM Web will include sites that are defined as MORC in the institution 
 file in VistA and allow users to open these teams that migrated in and 
 process patient assignments. Added Facility Type of MORC so these 
 divisions are now displayed in Web in the Station login dropdown and the 
 Create a Team station dropdown and this allows the users to log into 
 these divisions and create new teams or open existing teams to continue 
 patient assignments.

 RTC 332919 - The CPRS Header Sync process was taking too long to update 
 and in some cases it took over one hour to complete. Changed the 
 transaction management of the CPRS Header Sync by including 3 separate
 levels of thread execution for each site and patient which allows better
 control over threading, scheduling and transaction processing. This
 allowed the CPRS Header Sync job to avoid locking and long wait times in
 CPRS Header synchronization.
