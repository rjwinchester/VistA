Subject: PCMM WEB V1.11 ADDED SSOi REQUIREMENTS FOR PIV ACCESS TO PCMM WEB APPLICATION

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application version 
 WEBP*1*11 will implement the software changes necessary to meet VA 
 enterprise requirements for use of Personal Identification Verification 
 (PIV) cards and 2 factor authentication.  PCMM Web users will now be able 
 to use PIV cards to authenticate and log into PCMM Web.
  
  
 Configuration and Software Changes:
 ===================================
  
 1.      RTC 426795 - PCMM Web Implemented the Single Sign On Internal 
 (SSOi) in order to meet VA enterprise requirements and federal mandates 
 which require users to log into the application using their Personal 
 Identification Verification (PIV) card.
 PCMM Web users will now authenticate via SSOi; which is an authentication 
 service provided by Identity Access Management (IAM) and designated for 
 operations-based applications such as PCMM Web. This service provides an 
 extra layer of security when accessing the application, while reducing 
 time associated with multiple logon/logoff activities.  PCMM Web users 
 now are required to use a PIV card to log in unless an exception to use 
 VA User Credentials is allowed.
 More information on how to log in using PIV can be found at the following 
 location
