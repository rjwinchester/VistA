Subject: PCMM WEB V1.12 CONFIGURATION UPDATES

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application version 
 WEBP*1*12 will implement the following configuration changes to correct 
 defects reported by the field.
  
  
 Configuration and Software Changes:
 ===================================
  
 1.      RTC 481388 - When a team name change occurs, the CPRS Header Sync 
 job is triggered for all patients assigned to the team which is causing 
 an overload on the server processes and causes threads to be stuck 
 requiring bounces of the application GUI. The CPRS Header Sync job will 
 be optimized by adding sta3n to query parameters to speed it up and add 
 chunking on execution to limit single IN to 1000 entries which will mark 
 the vistapatient records to recalculate/resync when the team name changes 
 for the assigned patient.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 2.      RTC 461933 - Encounters are dropped for new PACT assignments if 
 there is a historical (inactive) PACT assignment with an End Date at one 
 3 digit station that ended after the new encounter date at the new 3 
 digit station. PCMM Web will override a new PACT assignment Start Date 
 that conflicts with a historical PACT assignment End Date at another 3 
 digit station so the valid teamlet encounter will be picked up by the 
 system and applied to the new PACT assignment and change the Status to 
 ACTIVE. The actual encounter date will be maintained in the LAST 
 ENCOUNTER DATE column.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 3.      RTC 461086 - If it is determined through discussion with a user 
 or a helpdesk ticket that an individual team needs to be deleted from 
 VistA due to duplication, then a managed operation is needed to force the 
 deletion of an entire team tree from VistA. This utility will expose an 
 internal testing routine that allows an administrator to run an operation 
 in the Spring JMX console. PCMM Web will now provide the ability to 
 perform a direct VistA deletion of an entire team tree for a team that is 
 duplicated to assist sites with the deletion of orphan teams (teams that 
 are not referenced from PCMM Web database and cannot be reached by 
 VistASync) from VistA. Sites will need to identify and provide the IEN of 
 the duplicate teams in VistA to assist in this process.
 CA-SDM Ticket: R14343161FY17    R12336516FY17
  
 4.      RTC 465276 - PCMM Web needs to add an additional Facility Type of 
 PRRTP so PCMM Web will include sites that are defined as PRRTP in the 
 institution file in VistA and allow users to open these teams that 
 migrated in and process patient assignments. Facility Type of PRRTP was 
 added and will now be displayed in PCMM Web in the Station login dropdown 
 box and the Create a Team station dropdown box. This allows the users to 
 log into this division and create new teams or open existing teams to 
 continue patient assignments.
 CA-SDM Ticket: I12367248FY17    I9964621FY16
  
 5.      RTC 487256 - During staff reassignment of a PCP position that is 
 a preceptor on a PACT team, the preception relations are created and 
 validated 1 at a time in sequential order for all precepted positions on 
 that team. If there is more than one precepted position with patients 
 assigned, this causes the following validation 
 "EnsurePatientAssignmentInsideAPPrecepteeDates" for the first created 
 perception (AP position) to fail because validator is run in team scope 
 and validates all preceptions, and not all of them are created at this 
 point. PCMM Web will delay the offending validator to the very end of the 
 staff reassignment process.
 Example: If there are 5 AP positions on a team and the PCP staff is 
 changing, the system will throw this validation error because it creates 
 a preception relationship for the 1st AP and PCP but sees that the other 
 4 APs do not have a perception relationship and they have patients 
 assigned so it gives the validation error.
 CA-SDM Ticket: I13486817FY17
  
 6.      RTC 502670 - The local station where the user is logged into 
 needs to display in the CPRS header even if the patient does not have a 
 local PACT assignment. CPRS header will list local station (3 digits) as 
 the first tag of the header.
 CA-SDM Ticket: I14009219FY17
  
  
 Implementation:
 ===============
 The PCMM Web WEBP*1*12 is a centrally managed web-based application and 
 will be implemented and deployed to a central web server.  No installation
 is required by sites.

 1.      I12367248FY17 - PCMM Web - Team Missing
         I9964621FY16 - PCMM WEB JAVA CONVERSION ISSUE
 Problem:
 PCMM Web needs to add an additional Facility Type of PRRTP so PCMM Web 
 will include sites that are defined as PRRTP in the institution file in 
 VistA and allow users to open these teams that migrated in and process 
 patient assignments.
  
 Resolution:
 Facility Type of PRRTP was added and will now be displayed in PCMM Web in 
 the Station login dropdown box and the Create a Team station dropdown box.
  
 2.      I14009219FY17 - Issue description with screen shots.  Please 
 describe you...
 Problem:
 The local station where the user is logged into needs to display in the 
 CPRS header even if the patient does not have a local PACT assignment.
  
 Resolution:
 CPRS header will list local station (3 digits) as the first tag of the 
 header.
  
 3.      R14343161FY17 - Request to Delete Duplicate PCMM Team Names
         R12336516FY17 - CPRS patient banner lists the same Primary Care 
                         PACT team 70...
 Problem:
 Individual team needs to be deleted from VistA due to duplication.
  
 Resolution:
 PCMM Web will now provide the ability to perform a direct VistA deletion 
 of an entire team tree for a team that is duplicated to assist sites with 
 the deletion of orphan teams (teams that are not referenced from PCMM Web 
 database and cannot be reached by VistASync) from VistA. Sites will need 
 to identify and provide the IEN of the duplicate teams in VistA to assist 
 in this process.
  
 4.    I13486817FY17 - Validation Error
 Problem:
 During staff reassignment of a PCP position that is a preceptor on a PACT 
 team, the preception relations are created and validated 1 at a time in 
 sequential order for all precepted positions on that team. If there is 
 more than one precepted position with patients assigned, this causes the 
 following validation "EnsurePatientAssignmentInsideAPPrecepteeDates" for 
 the first created perception (AP position) to fail because validator is 
 run in team scope and validates all preceptions, and not all of them are 
 created at this 
 point. 
  
 Resolution:
 PCMM Web will delay the offending validator to the very end of the 
 staff reassignment process.
