Subject: PCMM WEB V1.10 CONFIGURATION UPDATES

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application version 
 WEBP*1*10 will implement the following configuration changes to correct 
 defects reported by the field.
  
  
 Configuration and Software Changes:
 ===================================
 1.      RTC 337859 - The CPRS header does not update after a team name 
 change occurs. Added Java code to set all patients assigned to a team for 
 resynchronization of the CPRS header when the team name is changed.
 CA-SDM Ticket: I9271627FY16
  
  
 2.      RTC 348416 - The History of Team Attributes Changes are not 
 consistently displaying team name or Focus changes correctly. Updated the 
 DB view/query that is used for attribute changes functionality to 
 correctly display the Team Attributes Changes consistently in the History 
 of Team Attributes section on the Team Profile screen.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 3.      RTC 358647 - The Mental Health Team Capacity changes from 1000 to 
 1200 when Team name is changed or Patient is assigned to the Team. 
 Updated the Java code that saves team changes to the DB to correctly 
 re-calculate capacity and display the default of 1000 team capacity for 
 Mental Health teams when any change occurs to team. 
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 4.      RTC 373862 - The CPRS Header does not display the Nurse 
 Practitioner Associate Provider (NPAP) team role or the Physician 
 Assistant Associate Provider (PAAP) team role when a patient is 
 explicitly assigned to one of these team roles using the 'AP' tag. NPAP 
 and PAAP team roles were added to the Java code that builds the CPRS 
 header so that these 2 team roles will display in the CPRS Header when 
 patients are explicitly assigned to them with the 'AP' tag.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 5.      RTC 428868 - The CPRS Window does not display the Nurse 
 Practitioner Associate Provider (NPAP) team role or the Physician 
 Assistant Associate Provider (PAAP) team role when a patient is 
 explicitly assigned to one of these team roles with the 'Associate 
 Provider' tag. NPAP and PAAP team roles were added to the code that 
 builds the data for velocity template so that these 2 team roles will 
 display in the CPRS Window when patients are explicitly assigned to them 
 with the 'Associate Provider' tag.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 6.      RTC 428872 - The staff roles of "Physician Assistant Trainee" and 
 "Nurse Practitioner Trainee" display in PCMM Web and these 2 staff roles 
 are not considered trainee staff roles. In the DB, we changed the staff 
 role of "Physician Assistant Trainee" to "Physician Assistant" and "Nurse 
 Practitioner Trainee" to "Nurse Practitioner" so they will now display 
 correctly in PCMM Web during the staff assignment process.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 7.      RTC 372084 - The Nurse Practitioner Associate Provider and 
 Physician Assistant Associate Provider team roles do not display in the 
 Direct Care Provider (DCP) column when the patient is explicitly 
 assigned. The DB mapping was updated to set the Direct Care Provider 
 indicator to "Y" to allow the display of these 2 team roles in the DCP 
 column when a patient is explicitly assigned to one of these team roles.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 8.      RTC 260168 - The CPRS PC Header displays "/HBPC" in the tag "No 
 Local PACT/HBPC Assigned" when the patient is not assigned to a local 
 PACT team which is redundant because HBPC is a Primary Care care type. 
 Updated the Java code that displays the header information and removed 
 "/HBPC" from the 'No Local PACT Assigned' tag.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 9.      RTC 228845 - The search feature for the phone number field does 
 not have a dash format on the NON-VA Provider search and the NON-VA 
 Practice search which results in the NON-VA provider or practice from 
 being found. Added a mask to the phone number field to limit the phone 
 number to the correct format which then allows the phone number search 
 for the NON-VA Provider and NON-VA Practice to return and display.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 10.     RTC 366656 - The Preceptor relationship does not generate when 
 reassigning the team role of PCP/Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) to team 
 role PCP/Physician with an Associate Provider (AP) staffed. There was 
 obsolete code that prevented the preceptor relationship to complete when 
 the team role PCP/CNS was reassigned to the PCP/Physician team role. 
 Removed the old code and the preceptor relationship generates when the 
 team role PCP/CNS is reassigned to the PCP/Physician team role.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 11.     RTC 160997 - WASA security assessment group found problem with 
 Patient and Staff VistA searches that can be hacked by viewing the 
 browser console which would allow someone unauthorized at that station to 
 view patient or staff information. Added a station check for the user 
 that validates the users access to the accessed patient/staff station. 
 This limits data displayed to the user based on the permissions granted 
 to the user in PCMM Web.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 12.     RTC 441575 - The Intensity score is reported at the patient level 
 and all patients are currently reporting 1.0 instead of the actual 
 intensity score from the quarterly file loaded in PCMM Web. The intensity 
 score is fetched by joining fields in the DB and the wrong field was 
 being used. Changed the DB field "to join" from ICN to BASE_ICN table so 
 the actual patient intensity score is displayed on the patient profile. 
 CA-SDM Ticket: I10235977FY16
  
  
 13.     RTC 229689 - PC-HBPC team assignments allow the patient to be 
 assigned to both PCP and AP during the patient assignment process and 
 then both appear in the DCP column. HBPC has an implied preceptor 
 relationship and the patient can only be assigned to the PCP or the AP, 
 not both. Added a toggle to the PCP and AP checkboxes during the patient 
 assignment process so the user must select one or the other but cannot 
 select both of these team roles at the same time. 
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 14.     RTC 340069 - When searching for a team in the Search for Team 
 screen, a single quote in a team name will not allow the user to click on 
 the team to open its profile. Users use the single quote under the double 
 quote key instead of the apostrophe which is under the tilde key. Changed 
 the single quote to a HTML single quote entity so it would not interfere 
 with the Javascript and this allows the user to continue using the single 
 quote.
 CA-SDM Ticket: I9023114FY16
  
  
 15.     RTC 363522 - During a batch operation for a PC-HBPC team, the 
 assignment window allows the selection of both the PCP and AP team roles 
 which violates business rules. Assignment to AP is allowed even if the 
 PCP team role is unstaffed. PC-HBPC teams have an implied preceptor 
 relationship so the PCP team role cannot be unstaffed when there is a 
 staffed AP team role on the team. Changed the Javascript that manages 
 this logic to prevent selections of both team roles of PCP and AP during 
 the batch operation and not display an AP position if it is staffed when 
 the PCP team role is not staffed.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 16.     RTC 366123 - During a patient assignment to a PACT team, the 
 'Search for Team' screen  should only display 'Entire Team' when the PCP 
 team role is unstaffed but it displays Entire Team and staffed AP(s) team 
 roles(s) if the AP(s) had a previous preceptor relationship. There must 
 be a preceptor relationship between the PCP team role and the AP team 
 role(s). Changed the query that populates positions for this screen to 
 pull correct positions in during the assignment process; to use 
 preceptorship dates correctly; and to remove the AP team role(s) from 
 displaying since the PCP team role must be staffed for the preceptor 
 relationship to exist and AP's cannot be assigned to patients if the PCP 
 team role is unstaffed.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 17.     RTC 312799 - The CPRS window displays the staff member name for 
 an INACTIVE core teamlet position(s) that is staffed but is not current 
 team assignment information. Core teamlet roles are Primary Care Provider 
 (PCP), Care Manager (CM), Clinical Associate (CA) and Administrative 
 Associate (AA). Changed the Java code to filter out all inactive core 
 teamlet positions even if it is staffed so the staff member's name does 
 not display. CPRS window will continue to display the tags for the active 
 core teamlet roles of 'Primary Care Provider:', 'Care Manager:', 
 'Clinical Associate:' and 'Administrative Associate:' but the inactive 
 teamlet role(s) that are still staffed will not display the staff name.
 CA-SDM Ticket: I8514178FY16
  
  
 18.     RTC 264786 - A patient assigned to PC-HBPC team that has an 
 unstaffed PCP team role can be reassigned using the Pencil icon on the 
 patient profile to only a staffed AP position which causes Team 
 inconsistencies. Added Java code that disables the staffed AP position 
 when the PCP position is unstaffed at the time of the position 
 reassignment when using the pencil icon on the patient profile.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.

 CA-SDM Ticket(s):
 -----------------
 1.      I9271627FY16 - CPRS Header does not update with Team Name change
 Problem:
 The CPRS header does not update after a team name change occurs. 
  
 Resolution:
 Added Java code to set all patients assigned to a team for 
 resynchronization of the CPRS header when the team name is changed.
  
 2.      I10235977FY16 - Intensity score reporting incorrectly
 Problem:
 The Intensity score is reported at the patient level and all patients are 
 currently reporting 1.0 instead of the actual intensity score from the 
 quarterly file loaded in PCMM Web. 
  
 Resolution:
 The intensity score is fetched by joining fields in the DB and the wrong 
 field was being used. Changed the DB field "to join" from ICN to BASE_ICN 
 table so the actual patient intensity score is displayed on the patient 
 profile.
  
 3.      I9023114FY16 - Single quote in team name prevents user from 
 opening
 Problem:
 When searching for a team in the Search for Team screen, a single quote 
 in a team name will not allow the user to click on the team to open its 
 profile.
  
 Resolution:
 Users use the single quote under the double quote key instead of the 
 apostrophe which is under the tilde key. Changed the single quote to a 
 HTML single quote entity so it would not interfere with the Javascript 
 and this allows the user to continue using the single quote.
  
 4.      I8514178FY16 - CPRS Window displays inactive core teamlet 
 position(S)
 Problem:
 The CPRS window displays the staff member name for an INACTIVE core 
 teamlet position(s) that is staffed but is not current team assignment 
 information. 
  
 Resolution:
 Core teamlet roles are Primary Care Provider (PCP), Care Manager (CM), 
 Clinical Associate (CA) and Administrative Associate (AA). Changed the 
 Java code to filter out all inactive core teamlet positions even if it is 
 staffed so the staff member's name does not display. CPRS window will 
 continue to display the tags for the active core teamlet roles of 
 'Primary Care Provider:', 'Care Manager:', 'Clinical Associate:' and 
 'Administrative Associate:' but the inactive teamlet role(s) that are 
 still staffed will not display the staff name.
  
 5.      I10235977FY16 - PCMM Web - Intensity Score
 Problem:
 The Intensity score is reporting 1.0 instead of the actual intensity 
 score from the quarterly file loaded in PCMM Web. The intensity score is 
 fetched by joining fields in the DB and the wrong field was being used. 
  
 Resolution:
 Changed the DB field "to join" from ICN to BASE_ICN table so the actual 
 patient intensity score is displayed on the patient profile. 
  
 6.      I9023114FY16 - Unable open a Team in PCMM
 Problem:
 When searching for a team in the Search for Team screen, a single quote 
 in a team name will not allow the user to click on the team to open its 
 profile. Users use the single quote under the double quote key instead of 
 the apostrophe which is under the tilde key. 
  
 Resolution:
 Changed the single quote to a HTML single quote entity so it would not 
 interfere with the Javascript and this allows the user to continue using 
 the single quote.
  
 7.      I8514178FY16 - An inactive employee/position is displayed within 
 CPRS Heading
 Problem:
 The CPRS window displays the staff member name for an INACTIVE core 
 teamlet position(s) that is staffed but is not current team assignment 
 information. Core teamlet roles are Primary Care Provider (PCP), Care 
 Manager (CM), Clinical Associate (CA) and Administrative Associate (AA). 
  
 Resolution:
 Changed the Java code to filter out all inactive core teamlet positions 
 even if it is staffed so the staff member's name does not display. CPRS 
 window will continue to display the tags for the active core teamlet 
 roles of 'Primary Care Provider:', 'Care Manager:', 'Clinical Associate:' 
 and 'Administrative Associate:' but the inactive teamlet role(s) that are 
 still staffed will not display the staff name.
