Subject: PCMM WEB CONFIGURATION CHANGES TO OPTIMIZE SYNCHRONIZATION

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application version 
 WEBP*1*4 will assign a priority order to the queue for processing files
 synchronized to VistA so that new sites have a higher priority and the new
 sites are pushed to the top of the queue and synchronized first to 
 alleviate current long delays for the synchronization process to complete.
  
 Configuration Changes:
 ======================
  
 RTC Ticket: 280433 - VistA-sync takes a long time to finish for sites 
 that are being on-boarded during deployment.  The system places the new 
 sites at the very end of queue and they are processed in the same way as 
 all the rest of the sites. While that is Ok for the rest of the sites, 
 because they usually have handful of teams to sync, on boarded sites 
 usually have 100+ teams to sync and they have limited window to process 
 them all, we need to push the new sites to the front of the queue.
  
 Solution - The fix is to give the new sites more threads for processing 
 and to move their teams to the front of the queue.
  
 Implementation:
 ===============
 The PCMM Web WEBP*1*4 is a centrally managed web-based application and 
 will be implemented and deployed to a central web server.  No installation
 is required by sites.
