Subject: PCMM WEB V1.9 CONFIG UPDATES AND eHMP NEW TEAM ROLES

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application version 
 WEBP*1*9 will implement the following configuration changes to current 
 functionality that will reduce errors received by users and allow the 
 system to function more efficiently.
  
   
 Configuration and Software Changes:
 ===================================
  
 RTC 409913 - PCMM Web needs to add eHMP requirements to add 4 new Team 
 Roles to the Non-PC Specialty (Med/Surg) care type of Service Chief, 
 Scheduler, Physical Therapist and Triage Specialist along with 31 new 
 FOCUSs for this care type so the user has access to these new team roles 
 and new FOCUSs when managing a Non-PC Specialty team and patient 
 assignments. This will allow the user to manage consult teams to support 
 activity management within the consult process. 
  
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 RTC 390962 - Adding a comment to the Comment section of the Alerts is 
 causing a break in the JavaScript which freezes all of the alerts 
 preventing any further action if a user hits the Enter key when entering 
 a comment for a single alert. Removed the line feed for a new line and 
 the Enter key from the JavaScript so this does not cause errors in the 
 JavaScript and the user is able to enter comments without any problems.

    I10644189FY16           I8399771FY16            R10590409FY16   
    R11207604FY17
  
  
 RTC 409920 - PCMM Web gives the user an error stating there is concurrent 
 assignments to both PACT and HBPC teams if the patient had a previous or 
 historical assignment to a HBPC Team when the user tries to assign the 
 patient to a PACT team. If this error occurs, the system has detected a 
 valid encounter and tries to complete the PACT assignment for the patient 
 with the Start Date the same as the encounter date which conflicts with 
 the End Date of the PC-HBPC team assignment. The system will automatically
 override the Start Date of the PACT assignment to start on the day of the
 assignment to the PACT team to remove the conflict but will maintain the
 actual encounter date in the Last Encounter Date column on the patient's
 profile.

    R9746481FY16
  
  
 RTC 384612 - Secure Messaging relies on a VistA API to determine the 
 current provider for a patient by examining the most recent date in the 
 VistA file. (e.g. POSITION ASSIGNMENT HISTORY File (#404.52) that 
 Scheduling API $$TPPR^SCAPMC that MHV is using to retrieve the PCMM 
 Providers from VistA.) PCMM Web stores date ranges in a way where the End 
 Date of the first time range is equal to the Start Date of the next range 
 so in this file there were two different records with the same date which 
 confused the API. Secure Messaging group confirmed that automatically 
 backdating a staff member's un-assignment End Date by 1 minute and 
 syncing that back to VistA corrected the issue by showing the correct 
 provider. PCMM Web will change how PCMM Web writes back to the VistA file 
 by automatically backdating a staff member's un-assignment End Date by 1 
 minute in VistA but maintaining the correct date in PCMM Web GUI.
  
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue. 
  
  
 RTC 409926 - The Patient Search query is one large query that needs to be 
 optimized to provide faster performance when searching for patients. This 
 query will be broken into 3 smaller separate queries that will search by 
 1. SSN, 2. Last Initial + last 4 SSN or 3. Patient Name. Also the search 
 for PACT team name and assigned PCP/AP will be removed from the search 
 query parameters which will simplify the 3 smaller queries even further 
 by dropping multiple joins from the SQL execution. This new optimization 
 will also remove the Team Name and PCP/AP columns from the Patient Search 
 Results table that is displayed to the users when the patient search 
 results are returned.

 RTC 377578 - The CPRS Primary Care Window does not display any specialty 
 care types team assignments when the team position the patient is 
 assigned to is not actively staffed. The system will display all 
 specialty care types team assignments whether the team position is 
 actively staffed or not in the CPRS Primary Care Window using the 
 designated tag of "SP:" followed by the team name when a user clicks on 
 the CPRS Primary Care Header for details on the complete list of patient 
 team assignments.
  
 CA-SDM Ticket: R10355776FY16
  
  
 RTC 322004 - The Java code "Equals" implementation of the staff search 
 object searches for staff members by last name and SSN. If a staff 
 members SSN field is blank and it finds more than one staff member with 
 the same last name then the first staff member in the list is displayed 
 and all others are truncated. The end results would drop the duplicate 
 records because the SSN field was blank and it was not looking at the 
 first name in the comparison. Updated Java code "Equals" implementation 
 of staff search object to include First Name in the comparison set. This 
 search will now display all staff members with the same last name in the 
 search for staff results table even if the SSN field is blank.

    R9660984FY16            R11271291FY17
  
  
 RTC 417422 - The Auto-Inactivation (AI) process needs to be able to 
 provide single patient encounter information to enhance troubleshooting 
 efforts instead of pulling encounter information for the entire station. 
 Added code to JMS console that retrieves more information about an 
 encounter for a single patient versus the entire station.
  
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
  
 RTC 419499 - When manually re-running the AI job for a site, only 1 part 
 out of 4 parts of the AI job is re-ran which is the encounter search. 
 Currently when this part of the AI job is manually re-ran for encounter 
 searching, it sets the entire AI job's "Last Run Date" to that day which 
 should not be updated as it causes gaps in the AI execution window. A new 
 job type was created for a partial AI job run that does not update the 
 "Last Run Date" from the last full execution of the AI job and allows 
 easier execution of this part of the AI job when troubleshooting 
 assignments with encounters that have not been detected.
