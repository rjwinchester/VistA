Subject: PCMM WEB V1.15 CONFIGURATION UPDATES

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM) Web application version 
 WEBP*1*15 will implement the following configuration changes to current 
 functionality that will reduce errors received by users and allow the 
 system to function more efficiently.
  
  
 Configuration and Software Changes:
 ===================================
 1. RTC 456006 - The Primary Care - Home Based Primary Care (PC-HBPC) care 
 type needs to add the Primary Care Provider (PCP) team role to the 
 Centralized Patient Record System (CPRS) window display when a patient is 
 explicitly assigned to the Associate Provider (AP) team role. 
 The Java code for "patient summary builder" was updated to add 
 non-persistent PCP assignment to display in CPRS window even if the 
 patient is not explicitly assigned to the PCP team role but to the AP 
 team role.  
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 2. RTC 455951 - The Nurse Practitioner Associate Provider (NPAP) and the 
 Physician Assistant Associate Provider (PAAP) team roles were displaying 
 in the team Position List out of order. The PCMM-Web database has been 
 updated so that the sort order in table 
 pcmm.pcm_std_team_care_type_team_role table is now the requested sort 
 order.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 3. RTC 455945 - The NPAP and PAAP team roles are not displaying in the 
 correct order in the CPRS window. The sort has been corrected in PCMM-Web 
 so that the team roles for NPAP and PAAP are displayed below the PCP team 
 role if assigned to a patient.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 4. RTC 271096 - The CPRS Window needs to display "No PACT assigned at any 
 VA location" for patients with no PACT team assignments at any VA 
 location instead of displaying the label of "PACT: No Local PACT 
 Assigned" for all local divisions. The Velocity template in the database 
 was changed to not display "PACT: No Local PACT Assigned" per site if 
 there is no PACT assignments anywhere.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 5. RTC 611715 - The R25 Alert Rule for Multi-PACT (MPACT) patient 
 relocation sent as a PCMM Web alert when the patient completes relocation 
 needs to be clearer for the PCMM Coordinators. (i.e. The patient "xxx" 
 has completed the relocation to station "xxx". The patient must be 
 unassigned from all PACT assignments at all stations other than station 
 "xxx". The Multiple PACT request for this patient at station "xxx" is 
 being WITHDRAWN.)
 The R25 Alert Rule verbiage in the configuration file was updated as 
 requested so this alert is clearer to the users in PCMM Web.  (i.e. The 
 relocation to station "LAKE BALDWIN VA CLINIC (#675GG)" for the patient 
 "Doe, John M." has completed. The patient must be unassigned from all 
 PACT assignments at all stations other than station "LAKE BALDWIN VA 
 CLINIC (#675GG)".)
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 6. RTC 578628 - The query for the "View Team Attributes Change History" 
 link on the team profile screen was using the Java Persistence Query 
 Language (JPQL) and not performing at optimal speed. The JPQL was 
 replaced with a Structured Query Language (SQL) query to optimize query 
 performance.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 7. RTC 411473 - The Inpatient provider data displays in the CPRS window 
 but the verbiage message stating "Patient was not found for local site!" 
 when a patient is not pulled into PCMM Web needs to be clarified. The 
 verbiage in CPRS window was changed as recommended when the patient is 
 not pulled into PCMM Web for the station the user is viewing the CPRS 
 patient chart.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 8. RTC 542040 - Fortify Scans suggested a security update for the Java 
 Server Pages (JSP) parameter not being initialized. Fortify suggested 
 correcting it by adding the initialization of JSP parameter to default 
 value which is FALSE. The suggested correction caused the team list being 
 returned during the patient assignment process to be restricted to the 
 station the user was logged into. Changed the JSP parameter value to TRUE 
 to display all teams within the same 3 digit station during the patient 
 assignment process.
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 9. RTC 625600 - The CPRS Header Sync job needs to update a patient's 
 Primary Care assignment when the Direct Care Provider (DCP) team roles 
 have a staff change. DCP team roles include PCP, AP, NPAP and PAAP team 
 roles for primary care. A new Java Data Access Object (DAO) method was 
 created with a simplified specialized query that marks VistA patient 
 records for CPRS Header updates when the DCP staff members change. Then 
 the Java code that called the old method was updated to call the new 
 method for staff assignment/unassignment/reassignment for the DCP 
 positions.
 NOTE: This defect is not a retro fix for current tickets but should 
 correct the issue moving forward. To fix current tickets, the CPRS Header 
 Sync job will have to be run manually per patient or possibly per team 
 based on ticket/user information.

 10. RTC 631001 - When a user tries to assign a patient to the same 
 primary care team by clicking the ASSIGN button, a DB error message 
 appears that is not readable to the user. A validation rule was added to 
 prevent the DB error from displaying and provide a message to the user 
 that this is not the correct process when the user tries to assign 
 patient to the same team by clicking the ASSIGN button. The verbiage of 
 the message should be: "The patient "{0}" is assigned to the team "{1}" 
 more than once for the same time range."
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.
  
 11. RTC 631031 - Need to create a validation rule to prevent a user from 
 changing the PCP staff role that would break the preception rules for 
 existing AP(s) with direct patient assignments on the team. A validation 
 rule was added to the staff assignment code that will display a 
 validation error to prevent a user from changing the PCP staff role that 
 would break perception with existing AP(s) with direct patient 
 assignments on the team. 
 The verbiage of the message should be: "The patient "{0}" is assigned to 
 the position "{1}" from xx/xx/xxxx xx:xx EDT onward, but this position's 
 preceptor is not active over this date range."
 CA-SDM Ticket: No associated helpdesk tickets for this issue.

 Problem:
 The CPRS Header Sync job needs to update a patient's Primary Care 
 assignment when the Direct Care Provider (DCP) team roles have a staff 
 change. DCP team roles include PCP, AP, NPAP and PAAP team roles for 
 primary care. 
  
 Resolution:
 A new Java Data Access Object (DAO) method was created with a simplified 
 specialized query that marks VistA patient records for CPRS Header 
 updates when the DCP staff members change. Then the Java code that called 
 the old method was updated to call the new method for staff 
 assignment/unassignment/reassignment for the DCP positions.
