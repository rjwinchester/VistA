Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues in the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS 
 REPORTING (OR) package:
      
 1. There is no capability for a user to enter the pregnancy status for a 
    female patient within child-bearing age when executing an imaging quick
    order with its auto-accept functionality enabled. 
  
 2. The unsigned parent order of a lab test with multiple suborders that 
    is released as a verbal order does not display in the Unsigned Orders 
    view of Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).
  
 3. Users are selecting the wrong provider from provider lists from 
    multi-divisional sites when there is more than one provider with the
    same first and last name.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000955454 - Missing pregnancy status prompt for imaging quick 
                      order
  
    Patient Safety Issue: PSPO #2515
  
    Problem:
    ========
    There is no capability for a user to enter the pregnancy status for a 
    female patient within child-bearing age when executing an imaging quick
    order with its auto-accept functionality enabled. 
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Modified API SETUPS^ORWDXM4 to clear variable ORWPSWRG (which is
    used to indicate whether the auto-accept functionality is enabled) for
    the placement of an imaging quick order for a female patient within
    child-bearing age. This will provide the user the capability to enter
    the patient's pregnancy status as yes, no, or unknown.
  
  
 2. INC000000974760 - Unsigned parent verbal order missing from unsigned 
                      orders view 
  
    Problem:
    ========
    The unsigned parent order of a lab test with multiple suborders that is
    released as a verbal order does not display in the Unsigned Orders view
    of CPRS.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Modified API LR1^ORCSEND1 to allow the display in the orders view
    of the parent order of a multiple lab test that is released as a verbal
    order. This is accomplished by bypassing the setting of the data field 
    Veiled [$P(^OR(100,ORPARENT,3),"^",8)=1] if the NATURE variable is
    equal to "V".
  
    ***NOTE*** The installation of this patch will only resolve this issue 
    going forward.
  
 3. INC000000978835 - Provider's division missing from title 
  
    Patient Safety Issue: PSPO #2539
  
    Problem:
    ========
    Users are selecting the wrong provider from provider lists from 
    multi-divisional sites when there is more than one provider with the
    same first and last name. When providers share identical first and
    last names, their names should include their title, service/section and
    division to make their entries on lists unique.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Identified and replaced existing code in API NP2^ORWU1 that assigns
    the division that is appended to providers with identical first and
    last names. The code that assigned the division variable was changed to
    the following:  S ORDIV=$P(ORZ("DILIST",ORDD,0),U,2)
