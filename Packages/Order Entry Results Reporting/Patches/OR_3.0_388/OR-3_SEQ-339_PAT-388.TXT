    is selected  for an inpatient on the Computerized Patient Record System

    help message is displayed when two or more question marks are entered

    OE/RR AUTO-DC RULES file (#100.6) is incorrect.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000218091 - Herbal Quick Order Start Date/Time Not Functioning
  
    Problem:
    ========
    When a user is adding or editing a quick order for a non-VA medication
    in the Enter/edit quick orders option [ORCM QUICK ORDERS] and they
    enter 'NOW' as the date and time value in the Start Date/Time field and
    then select the quick order in the Orders tab in CPRS, the Start Date
    field is blank. This occurs for inpatients only.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Modified the API BLDQRSP^ORWDXM1 to bypass clearing the Start Date/Time
    field for a non-VA medication quick order for inpatients.
  
 2. INC000000962466 - Inaccurate help message displayed for IV medication  
                      quick order
  
    Problem:
    ========
    When a user is adding or editing an IV medication quick order in the 
    Enter/edit quick orders option [ORCM QUICK ORDERS] and they enter
    either two or three question marks at the Infuse over time prompt (for
    intermittent infusion) or the Infusion Rate prompt (for continuous
    infusion) the following help text is displayed: "This response can be
    free text, from 1-30 characters in length. Enter the number of minutes
    over which to infuse this medication." This message is misleading
    because the response for the intermittent infusion rate must be a whole
    number and the response for a continuous infusion is no longer allowed
    the 30 characters.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Modified the API ENRATE^ORCDPSIV to display the following message when 
    the user enters two or more question marks at the Infuse over time
    prompt (for intermittent infusion) or the Infusion Rate prompt (for
    continuous infusion): "Enter the number of minutes over which to
    infuse this medication." This is consistent to what is displayed when
    one question mark is entered.
  
 3) INC000000883067 - OERR - Documentation 
  
    Problem:
    ========
    The data dictionary's description for the TYPE OF EVENT field (#2) in
    the OE/RR AUTO-DC RULES file (#100.6) references the wrong field when
    describing OR events.
  
    Note: This problem corresponds to a change made in Patch SR*3*157, 
    released 11/1/2006. The help text in the data dictionary was not
    modified when SR*3*157 was released.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Modified the data dictionary's description text for the TYPE OF EVENT 
    field (#2) in the OE/RR AUTO-DC RULES file (#100.6) by replacing the 
    field name TIME PAT OUT OF OR with field name TIME PAT IN OR.
