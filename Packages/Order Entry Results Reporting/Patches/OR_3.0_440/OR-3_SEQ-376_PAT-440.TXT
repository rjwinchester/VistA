Subject: WRONG DOSAGE FOR ORDERS CREATED IN LIST MANAGER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects 1 issue within the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING 
 package:
  
 1. Some sites have an inappropriate link to the List Manager version of 
 CPRS. When they renew orders from this link they are generated with the 
 wrong Dispense Drug. While ListMan CPRS is not supposed to be used, we 
 are putting out an emergency patch to fix the issue.

 CA SDM OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. R9772955FY16  - We are receiving errors when pharmacists are finishing 
                    prescriptions that kick them out.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Some sites have the Ward Clerk Menu [OR MAIN MENU WARD CLERK] 
    available from the HRC Pharmacy Customer Care Menu [DVBA HRC MENU 
    PHARMACY CC]. Renewing an order from that menu can cause the wrong
    Dispense Drug to be generated.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Access to the old CPRS List Manager Menus should be turned off. 
    However, this patch will provide a fix for the order renewal issue
    until the sites integrate CPRS GUI into their workflow. Routine ORCDPS
    will be modified to allow the recalculation of the Dispense Drug when
    renewing an order.
  
    Technical Details:
    ------------------
    The CPRS Quick Order Menus should be the only code that is accessing 
    the old CPRS List Manager routines. OR*3*350 made a change to suppress
    Dispense Drugs from being generated for Quick Orders. This patch will 
    modify ORCDPS so that the suppression only happens when the code is 
    called from the Quick Order Menus.
