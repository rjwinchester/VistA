Subject: VSR RPC BACKDOOR UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch OR*3.0*479 is being released to support the security vulnerability
 solution for the VistA Security Remediation (VSR) program that focuses on 
 updates to the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker.
 
 Defects:
 869485 - DEF - Remote procedure call (RPC) ORQQPL EDIT SAVE
 869492 - DEF - Remote procedure call (RPC) ORQQPL UPDATE
 869497 - DEF - Remote procedure call (RPC) ORQQPL ADD SAVE
 
 Included in this patch are the following updates:
 1.  Remote Procedure call ORQQPL EDIT SAVE, ORQQPL UPDATE, and ORQQPL ADD 
     SAVE
     a. These RPC's allow for parameters to be passed in and then use 
        indirection to set up certain arrays (GMPFLD, GMPORIG, ORARRAY). The
        use of indirection is done without any validation that the Parameters
        are only setting the needed arrays.  This allows a parameter to be 
        passed in that potentially allows for data to be read, deleted, or 
        edited within the RPC calls. 
 
     b. Resolution will include a coding change to verify that the parameters 
        being passed in are both setting individual arrays (as intended) and 
        is not passing a function or direct global set (this is accomplished
        via a check for a double quote after the equal sign). This suggested 
        logic change should close the security hole within the code.
 
     c. Additional code changes will remove the check for $XECUTE and modify  
        the logic to check to make sure that the first value after the equal 
        sign is a double quote.  
 
 The suggested logic changes should close the security hole within the code 
 and prevent all functions from being executed within the code.

 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 1. If the release is provided using PackMan, choose the PackMan message 
    containing this build. Then select the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan  
    option to load the build.
 
 2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
    Installation Menu.  From this menu, 
 
    A. Select the Verify Checksums in Transport Global option to confirm 
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global. When 
       prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch or build name (ex.  
       OR*3.0*479).
 
       NOTE: Using <spacebar><enter> will not bring up a Multi-Package build 
             even if it was loaded immediately before this step. It will only 
             bring up the last patch in the build.
  
    B. Select the Backup a Transport Global option to create a backup message   
       of any routines exported with this patch. It will not backup any other   
       changes such as DDs or templates. 
 
    C. You may also elect to use the following options: 
       i.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
           the components of the KIDS build.
       
       ii. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
           is installed.  It compares all of the components of this patch,
           such as routines, DDs, templates, etc.
 
    D. Select the Install Package(s) option and choose the patch to install.
