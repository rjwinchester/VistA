Subject: OE/RR NOTIFICATONS (#100.9) FILE INDEX REBUILD AND LAB VBECS MODIFIER ISSUE

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two (2) issues:
  
 1. INC3314429 - "C" index issue
 2. INC4023164 - Lab VistA Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) 
 Modifier Issue
  
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 -----------------------------
 HITPS-6471 (INC4023164 - Lab VBECS Modifier Issue)
  
  
 Blood Bank Review:
 ------------------ 
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch OR*3.0*503 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in ProPath standard titled: BBM Team 
 Review of VistA Patches. This patch does not alter or modify any VistA 
 Blood Bank software design safeguards or safety critical elements 
 functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch OR*3.0*503 have no adverse effect on 
 Blood Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1.  INC3314429 - "C" index, which contains only the PACKAGE ID (#.02)
 field, in the OE/RR NOTIFICATIONS (#100.9) file contains entries for the
 NAME (#.01) field.
  
     Problem:
     -------
     During the investigation of INC3314429 it was questioned why the old
     NAME was still in the "C" index after the NAME was changed (by patch
     OR*3.0*350).  The "C" index only contains the PACKAGE ID (#.02) 
     field. It was found that there should not be a "C" index for
     the NAME (#.01) field.  This may have been leftover from original
     development.  There is no data definition that associates the NAME 
     (#.01) field with the "C" index.  The only issue this may cause is
     that the old NAME could be entered when looking up notifications which
     would find the record for the new name.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     This patch saves off the current "C" index for OE/RR  
     NOTIFICATIONS(#100.9) file then deletes and rebuilds it.  This is
     accomplished by use of a post install routine (ORPS503).
  
  
  
 2.  INC4023164 - Lab VBECS Modifier Issue
  
     Problem:
     -------
     If the first component during a Computerized Patient Record 
     System (CPRS) VBECS ordering session has a modifier
     but any subsequent component(s) do not, the subsequent component(s)
     will be filed with the first component's modifier.
  
     Resolution:
     ----------
     Modify routine ORCSEND2 to not file a modifier for a VBECS component
     if one was not specified by the user during the CPRS ordering session.
  
 NOTE: An additional CPRS VBECS modifier issue will be addressed in 
       OR*3.0*405 (CPRS version 32) under ticket INC3435911.  This issue 
       involves the fact that if a component which has a modifier is
       removed during the CPRS VBECS ordering session, modifiers will be
       deleted from all components.  Since the resolution requires a 
       Graphical User Interface (GUI) change, the resolution must be
       included in OR*3.0*405.

 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system. Installation should 
 take less than 1 minute to complete.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
  
 1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2. Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option. 
  
 3. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
    Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following 
    options.  When prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter the patch OR*3.0*503.
          
    a. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will allow
       you to view all changes that will be made when this patch is
       installed.  It compares all components of this patch routines, DDs,
       templates, etc.
    b. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you to
       ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
       global.
    c. Backup a Transport Global - This option will preserve a copy of the 
       routine exported in this patch prior to installation.  
  
 4. From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
    choose the patch to install (OR*3.0*503).
  
 5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?', enter

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
  
 INC3314429 Back-out:
 -------------------- 
 The index being rebuilt is saved to a XTMP global by the post install 
 routine, ORPS503. If there is a need to restore the "C" index, contact the
 help desk and request help restoring it.
  
 INC4023164 Back-out:
 --------------------
 The routine ORCSEND2 may be restored from the backup MailMan message 
 which was created during patch install.
