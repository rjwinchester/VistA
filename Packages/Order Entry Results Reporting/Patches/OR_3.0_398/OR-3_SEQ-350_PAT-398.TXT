Subject: Encounter form dialog performance issues

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Shortly after the release of several ICD-10 patches (LEX*2*80, ICD*18*57,
 IBD*3*63, etc.), several sites reported that the encounter form dialog in
 CPRS was taking an average of 1-2 mins to load. This was unacceptable and
 impacting patient care. 
  
 It is important to note that certain encounter forms will take a little
 longer to load than others due to the varying data intensity levels of the
 forms. This is particularly true for the National Primary Care FY14-Q4
 form, which consists of some 1331 diagnoses and over 120 procedures.
  
 The six sites who reported the issue include: Asheville, Beckley, Salem, 
 Northern Indiana, Dallas, & Omaha. After some investigation, it was 
 determined that half of these sites were still running on VMS servers and 
 the other half a mixed OS environment (VMS back end with Linux front 
 end). Some metric tests were performed and it was determined that running
 on a slower VMS system did contribute to some of the performance issues, 
 but not entirely all.
  
 After further research, it was concluded that several API's that are 
 called to retrieve encounter form information during the load could be
 optimized for improvement. One of the API's is DIAG^ORWPCE which is 
 modified in this patch. The associating API, CHKLST^IBDF18A2 is updated in
 the IBD*3.0*66 patch. These two patches comprise of the short term 
 solution and serves to provide immediate remedy while a long term 
 solution is being developed.

 1. INC000001042172: After the installation of Lex 80 and ICD 57 we have 
 experienced a 30 to 45 second delay before the encounter box pops up.
  
 2. INC000001054218: Users have been experiencing significant delays in 
 accessing encounter forms in CPRS since installing patch PXRM*2*26.  
 Takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes for the form to open once 
 clicking on it.
  
 3. INC000001050760: CPRS encounter form dialog performance issues.

 Software Retrieval Instructions:
 -------------------------------- 
 This software is being released in a combined build with IBD*3*66. The 
 file name will be: OR_398_IBD_66.KID. Please download the software using 
 ASCII format.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may
