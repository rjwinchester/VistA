Subject: ORWPCE4 RPC FIX/MONTHLY CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE REPORT/TEAM LIST

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch corrects 3 issues within the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING 
 package:
  
 1. The hard error <UNDEFINED>EN+3^LEXAFIL occasionally and sporadically
    occurs when the user uses a function in the Computerized Patient Record
    System (CPRS) that calls the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) ORWPCE4 LEX.
  
 2. The automated monthly controlled substance report to providers is 
    sending the internal id for Prescription instead of the external id.
  
 3. Users can't remove themselves from patient lists of type "Patient 
    Manual" 
  
 NOTE: Routine ORWPCE4 had an incorrect patch list that was corrected in
 this patch.
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
  
 1. I8563813FY16  - Lexicon error <><UNDEFINED>EN+3^LEXAFIL in CPRS
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The hard error <UNDEFINED>EN+3^LEXAFIL occasionally and sporadically
    occurs when the variable DIC("S") gets left in memory and then the user
    uses a function in CPRS that calls the RPC ORWPCE4 LEX.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The routine ORWPCE4 has been modified to "new" the variable DIC prior
    to executing any other calls.
  
 2. R8469728FY16 - The automated monthly controlled substance report to
                   providers...
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The automated monthly controlled substance report to providers is
    sending the internal id for Prescription instead of the external id.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------   
    The routine ORDEA02 has been modified to format the Prescription id
    to the external format.
  
 3. I9832345FY16 - Team List bug
   
    Problem:
    --------
    When a team list was set as type "patient manual" users were unable to 
    remove themselves from the team. Currently to use the "remove yourself 
    from this team"  button the following conditions must be met. Only one 
    list selected, team list is not of type personal, and the subscribe 
    field is yes. Since "patient manual" did not have the subscribe field
    linked to it, it never met the logic.
      
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify ORLP to query for the SUBSCRIBE field (#1.7)in the OE/RR
    LIST file (#100.21) for "patient manual" lists so that sites can
    determine if users should be able to remove themselves from the list.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch can be loaded with users in the system but it is recommended 
 that it be installed when user activity is low.  Installation time will be
 less than 2 minutes.
  
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch 
  
  2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
      Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the 
      following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch
      OR*3.0*465:
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not back
         up any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         (allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
  4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
      choose the patch to install.
  
  5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
      answer NO.
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Menu Options and
      Protocols? NO//', answer NO.
  
  7.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Backout/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 While no data was modified by this patch installation there was a change 
 to the FileMan Data Dictionary for the OE/RR LIST file (#100.21), 
 SUBSCRIBE field (#1.7). It was a minor change to the description and does 
 not require changing back. Therefore, no rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksums match
 the pre-patch checksums from the patch description.
