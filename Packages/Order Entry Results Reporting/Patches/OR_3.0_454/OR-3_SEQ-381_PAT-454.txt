Subject: PATCH TO A PATCH OR*3.0*420 FIX

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This emergency patch fixes two coding issues found during field testing 
 of patch OR*3.0*420, as well as two non-coding issues.
  
      - Removes code and comments left in routine ORWDPS2 during
        development that are causing an error in the Bar Code Medication
        Administration (BCMA) application when using the CPRS MED Order 
        button.
  
      - Resolves an undefined error caused by namespacing the Class III to
        Class I variables in routine ORWDPLM2. The variables in question
        were  named ORNODE, when they should have been named ORLNODE to
        comply with national standards. This patch changes the variable
        name ORNODE in routine ORWDPLM2 to the name ORLNODE.
  
      - Corrects a spelling error in the OR*3.0*420 patch description
        instructions for setting up a TIU Object, which inserted the
        following line of code. 
      
        S
        X=$$SL^ORWDLPM2(DFN,$S($G(X0)]"":$P(X0,U),$G(NODE0)]"":$P(NODE0,U),1:""),
        " ^TMP($J,""ORWDPLM2"")") 
      
        The section S X=$$SL^ORWDLPM2 should have been 
        S X=$$SL^ORWDPLM2. 
       
        The corrected whole line of code to be inserted in the
        TIU Object is: 
  
        S
        X=$$SL^ORWDPLM2(DFN,$S($G(X0)]"":$P(X0,U),$G(NODE0)]"":$P(NODE0,U),1:""),
        "^TMP($J,""ORWDPLM2"")")
  
        NOTE: The TIU object will not work for an Inpatient Medication
        Quick Order because the VistA Production environment does not
        maintain the data required to extract and run the object in the
        Inpatient scenario.
  
  
     -  Changes the result returned if a lab monitor connected to a quick
        order is deleted from the Drug file. In OR*3.0*420, the code
        returns "^@@^", which means no results. This can be confusing for
        the clinician. Code was added to the ORWDPLM2 routine so that a
        blank result is returned if the lab monitor is not available and
        there is nothing to print
  
  
     EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch OR*3*454 contains
     changes to a package referenced in ProPath standard titled: BBM Team 
     Review of VistA Patches. This patch does not alter or modify any VistA
     Blood Bank software design safeguards or safety critical elements 
     functions.
  
     RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch OR*3*454 have no effect on Blood
     Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing the updated KIDS package, the site/region should have 
 saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a 
 Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option. The message containing the 
 backed up routines can be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at 
 the Message Action prompt. The PackMan function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE is 
 then used to install the backed up routines onto the VistA system. 
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the OR routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the OR routines have been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain 
 the designation of patch OR*3.0*454 on line 2 in the patch list section.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
