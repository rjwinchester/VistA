Description:

    to edit
 2. Editing the drug and going through the IV package deletes the 
    restrictions set in file 101.43.
 3. Renewed orders are not being discontinued from the Meds tab.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. CA SDM I12064550FY17 / RTC 553100 BL: Order Detail View Anomaly on 
    Discontinue Due to Edit Orders
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The order details for inpatient IV orders with multiple discontinues due
 to edits, display the incorrect text. It displays the text from order
 action #1 regardless which action is passed in.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified the routine ORQ2 to check if the action was passed in with the 
 order number, if so return the text from the action passed in.
  
 2. CA SDM I10764386FY16 / RTC 538586 BL: Problems with Pharmacy 
    Software
  
 Problem:
 -------
 If a quick order restriction has been defined for an IV additive or 
 solution orderable item, and if changes are made to the IV additive 
 or solution using the Drug Enter/Edit option [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT], the
 quick order restriction is removed from the orderable item. This issue 
 occurs when the IV additive or solution is marked for "IV" only (not Ward 
 Stock, Outpatient, etc. also).
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified routine ORMFN to not overlay a quick order restriction on an 
 orderable item after updates are made to a dispense drug using the 
 Drug Enter/Edit option [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT].
  
 3. CA SDM I9836752FY16 / RTC 541977 Outpatient Pharmacy - Issue
    Discontinuing Orders
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When discontinuing a pending medication renewal order in CPRS, users are
 shown a window giving the option to also discontinue the original order.
 If the user selects this option in the Meds tab, the original order is not
 discontinued. The option does work correctly when selected in the Orders 
 tab.
      
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify ORWORR so that the ORWORR GETBYIFN remote procedure call correctly
 identifies the original order.

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
