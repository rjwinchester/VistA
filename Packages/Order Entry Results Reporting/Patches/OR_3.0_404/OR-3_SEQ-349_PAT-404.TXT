Description:
============

 1. Shortly after the release of several ICD-10 patches (LEX*2*80,
 ICD*18*57, IBD*3*63, etc.), several sites reported that the encounter form
 dialog in CPRS was taking an average of 1-2 mins to load. This was
 unacceptable and impacting patient care.
  
 ***Important Note*** 
 Certain encounter forms will take a little longer to load than others due
 to the varying data intensity levels of the forms. This is particularly
 true for the National Primary Care FY14-Q4 form, which consists of some
 1331 diagnoses and over 120 procedures.
  
 There are two changes being made to improve the encounter form load 
 times. The first will be released in this patch (OR*3*404) and will be 
 the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) GUI change. The second will 
 be VistA server side changes and will be released in OR*3*398. We 
 anticipate OR*3*398 will be released in December, 2014.
  
 2. It was discovered, with CPRS v30A, that there was a problem in Clinic 
 Reminder dialogs with prompts not appearing correctly. This could result 
 in missing information associated with that encounter. A CPRS GUI change 
 is required to correct this.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ----------------------------
 1. INC000001042172  After the installation of Lex 80 and ICD 57 we have
                     experienced a 30 to 45 second delay before the
                     encounter box pops up.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 After the installation of Lex 80 and ICD 57 we have experienced a 30 to 
 45 second delay before the encounter box pops up.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The resolution is in three parts. The first set of changes will be made 
 in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Graphical User Interface 
 (GUI). Two other patches are being prepared: GMPL*2*47 and IBD*3*66.
  
 2. INC000001064706  GUIv30a (OR*3*385) appears to have BROKEN the display 
                     of PXRM LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING in the reminder dialog
                     template form. PXRM LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING was
                     properly configured on an element (with resolution
                     type set to 'done at encounter', and the education
                     topic linked to the element). 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 CPRS GUI v30A made some modifications in the Clinical Reminder dialogs 
 that have caused isse with the display of prompts. This could also affect 
 updates getting sent to ancillary packages such as Women's Health.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Modifications have to made to CPRS to properly display the prompts which 
 also corrects the issue of updates being sent to ancillary packages.
