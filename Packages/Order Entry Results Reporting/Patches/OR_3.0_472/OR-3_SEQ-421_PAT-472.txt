Subject: SUICIDE HIGH RISK PATIENT ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Mental Health Suicide Prevention - Suicide High Risk Patient 
 Enhancements (SHRPE) effort incorporates enhancements that will modify the
 VistA Registration application and Computerized Patient Record System
 (CPRS).
  
 The Disruptive Behavior Reporting System (DBRS) record numbers can now be 
 recorded in the Registration (DG) files that are related to Patient Record
 Flags (PRF), providing a convenient reference between VistA and the DBRS.
 The "Patient Record Flags" display on the cover sheet in CPRS is updated
 to display DBRS numbers associated with the patient.
  
 This patch implements the functionality that allows CPRS to display the 
 DBRS data stored in VistA Registration database.

 Back-Out Plan:
 --------------------
 The Back-Out Procedure consists of restoring routines. 
 The back-out is to be performed by persons with programmer-level access,
 and in conjunction with the SHRPE Team.
  
 The pre-patch versions of routines can be restored by using backup 
 MailMan message that should be created during installation.
  
 Note: The routines can be modified by another patch that follows the 
 OR*3.0*472 and released after the installation of the OR*3.0*472. In this
 case restoring routines from the backup MailMan messages might cause 
 issues. It is recommended that the sites contact the development team and
 the National VistA Support team for specific solutions to their
 unique problems prior to backing out the patch.
