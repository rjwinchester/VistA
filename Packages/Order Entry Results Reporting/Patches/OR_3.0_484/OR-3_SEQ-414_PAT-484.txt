Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to export the new version of the 
 Ordercom.dll file with 2 Factor Authentication changes.  This will be 
 done at the PACKAGE level parameter for parameter definition OR MOB DLL 
 VERSION. The OR MOB DLL VERSION parameter is used to store the current 
 server version of the CPRS Med Order Button (MOB) DLL. That is the 
 version of the Ordercom.dll file which will then allow for a version 
 check to be done when logging into CPRS.
