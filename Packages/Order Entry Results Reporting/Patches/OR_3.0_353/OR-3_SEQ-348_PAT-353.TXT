  - Routine

Description:
============

  
 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_Prod_Overview_Guide_Groups_5_6_7.pdf) posted on the Anonymous
 directory for installation order. This is critical for proper
 functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
 Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
 diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
 Dates of service or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
 after the implementation date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
 codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
 codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
 systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
 alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
 which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
 decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
  
 These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
 so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
 complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
 track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research.
  
 This patch, in conjunction with GroupNotes.exe, is intended to:
  
 1.  Provide the ability to search on ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. The 
     search function is performed on the Group Notes Encounter Form
     screen and through the use of the 'Other Diagnosis' button.
  
 2.  Provide the ability to add/edit/store active ICD-10 diagnosis 
     codes (up to 8 alphanumeric characters including the decimal point
     that follows the 3rd character) from the Group Notes encounter
     form screen.
  
 3.  If the user tries to select the inactive diagnosis from the 
     Problem List, a warning shall display for inactive ICD-9-CM and
     ICD-10-CM diagnosis.
  
 4.  Provide the ability to update the current ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 
     within the problem list items to an active ICD-10-CM diagnosis
     code.
  
 5.  Provide the ability to select and add an active ICD diagnosis on 
     the Encounter Form Data screen via:
       - The diagnosis "pick lists" in the Diagnosis Section or;
       - By using the 'Other Diagnosis' selection button.
  
 6.  Provide the ability to display ICD-10 diagnosis codes and 
     descriptions within the Group Notes "Encounter Form" window.
  
 7.  Provide an RPC to retrieve the activation date for any given 
     coding system (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, etc.)
  
 8.  In the Progress Notes screen of the Group Notes application, the 
     ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes and descriptions for
     encounter(s) shall display as follows:
       - Multiple patient selection:  
         in the 'Encounter Data for all patients'
         field, any ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnostic 
         code and descriptions that were entered for 
         the group encounter shall display.
       - Single patient selection:  
         in the 'Encounter Data for XX patient' field,
         any ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnostic code 
         and descriptions that were entered for that 
         patient's encounter shall display.
  
 NOTE: Functionality specific to activation of the ICD-10 code set shall 
 not be seen by end users until the code set has been activated.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There are no pre installation routines.  Patch consists of a 
 single routine with no file or template updates and one post install 
 routine as documented in the Post Installation Instructions. The Windows
 clients will need to install the Group Notes Executable listed in the
 Software and Documentation Retrieval Instructions.
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system, although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following option. When prompted for the INSTALL, enter the patch #
     (OR*3.0*353):
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
        back up any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
        is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
        (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
        you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the

 8.  If prompted Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//, respond 0.
  
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 The routine OR30353P is used to insure registration of the new Group
 Notes RPC's introduced with this patch.  As the Menu Option that these 
 RPC's are registered to (OR CPRS GUI CHART) belongs to the CPRS namespace 
 there is a possibility that new patches released after this one might 
 overwrite and remove these registrations.  In the event his happens the 
 IRM can rerun this routine with a call to REG^OR30353P and it will fix the
 registration problem without damaging the CPRS application. Please note
 that OR*3.0*385 will NOT cause this issue.  If the site does not feel that
 they need this capability then they may delete this routine using the
 KERNEL option 'Delete Routines' [XTRDEL].
  
  
 GUI Executable Installation Instructions
 ----------------------------------------
 The Group Notes GUI client software is being distributed as a Windows
 installation package. Installation of the application is performed 
 without user intervention by Windows administrator.
  
 If you need to install GUI manually please verify that workstation 
 is configured for VistA GUI applications and you have enough privileges 
 for installation (Any workstation configured for CPRS will run 
 Group Notes)
  
 Manual installation steps:
 1. Copy the Group Notes executable (GroupNotes.exe) and the Group 
    Notes help file (CPRSGN.hlp) to the machine's hard drive or to 
    a server permanently connected to the machine.
 2. Create a shortcut for GroupNotes.exe. Alternatively you may add 
    Group Notes to the Tools menu of CPRS.
 3. Make sure a properly configured HOSTS file is present on the 
    machine.
  
 For details on setup of VistA user accounts please refer to the GUI
 Implementation Guide (GNIM.pdf)
