The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) 
"BLD",8703,1,2,0)
Class 1 Software Remediation project replaces the 30-year-old set of 
"BLD",8703,1,3,0)
diagnosis and procedure codes (ICD-9-CM) that medical personnel use. 
"BLD",8703,1,4,0)
Dates of service, or dates of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or 
"BLD",8703,1,5,0)
after the implementation date will use the ICD-10 code set. Clinical 
"BLD",8703,1,6,0)
Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes increase from about 13,000 ICD-9 
"BLD",8703,1,7,0)
codes to more than 68,000. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) procedure 
"BLD",8703,1,8,0)
codes increase from about 3,800 ICD-9 codes to nearly 87,000. Both 
"BLD",8703,1,9,0)
systems also expand the number of characters allotted to seven 
"BLD",8703,1,10,0)
alpha-numeric characters. This value does not include the decimal point, 
"BLD",8703,1,11,0)
which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no 
"BLD",8703,1,12,0)
decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set. 
"BLD",8703,1,13,0)
 
"BLD",8703,1,14,0)
These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, 
"BLD",8703,1,15,0)
so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand 
"BLD",8703,1,16,0)
complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better 
"BLD",8703,1,17,0)
track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
"BLD",8703,1,18,0)
specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
"BLD",8703,1,19,0)
decision making and outcomes research.
