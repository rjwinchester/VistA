Subject: CPRS GUI v30.A

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_PROD_OVERVIEW_GUIDE_GROUPS_5_6_7.pdf) posted on the 
 Anonymous directory or specified FTP directory for installation order.
 This is critical for proper functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 This patch contains the ICD-10 project enhancements for the Computerized 
 Patient Records System CPRSv30.A project. This project will modify CPRS,
 TIU, GMRC, GMTS, GMPL, PXRM, and OERR to meet the requirements proposed by
 the Dept. of Health and Human Services to adopt ICD-10 code set 
 standards. Please see the CPRS GUI v30.A Release Notes for a summary of 
 the changes and enhancements.
  
 On January 16, 2009, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 
 released a final rule for replacing the 30-year-old ICD-9-CM code set 
 with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) and International Classification of Diseases, 
 Tenth Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) with dates of 
 service, or date of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or after 
 the industry activation date. The classification system consists of more
 than 68,000 codes, compared to approximately 13,000 ICD-9-CM codes. There
 are nearly 87,000 ICD-10-PCS codes, while ICD-9-CM has nearly 3,800
 procedure codes. Both systems also expand the number of characters
 allotted from five and four respectively to seven alpha-numeric
 characters. This value does not include the decimal point, which follows
 the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set. There is no decimal point
 in the ICD-10-PCS code set. These code sets have the potential to reveal
 more about quality of care, so that data can be used in a more meaningful
 way to better understand complications, better design clinically robust
 algorithms, and better track the outcomes of care. ICD-10-CM also
 incorporates greater specificity and clinical detail to provide
 information for clinical decision making and outcomes research.
  
 NOTE: Functionality specific to activation of the ICD-10 code set shall 
 not be seen by end users until the code set has been activated.
  
 CPRS GUI v30.A consists of one host file, an updated CPRS GUI, and 
 several Help files, too many to list (which will be located in a 
 directory named HELP):
  
 1.      OR_30_385.KID
 2.      CPRSChart.exe
 3.      CPRS_30A_Help.zip (HELP Directory of files)

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 N/A
  
 Problem:
 -------
 1. With ICD-10 activation, users were unable to annotate an existing 
 problem with an inactive ICD-9 code without having to update/change the 
 problem to a SNOMED CT equivalent term first on the Problems tab (whether 
 date is before/after Oct 1, 2015).
  
 2. Detroit reported a IS NOT A VALID FLOATING POINT VALUE error in IOC 
 test of the Group Notes (GN) app. It appears that this error is due to 
 some missing RPCs (ORWGN IDTVALID & ORWGN MAXFRQ) that failed to get 
 registered on the OR CPRS GUI CHART option in patch OR*3*353 T8. 
  
 3. With ICD-9 active, when a user selects a SNOMED CT (SCT)/ICD-9 problem 
 from their pick/selection list to add to the Problem list, the system 
 saves and stores the SCT Designation code as the Concept code which is 
 incorrect. This is displayed incorrectly as well on the Problem 
 list. Problems are being incorrectly flagged ("#" indicator) with 
 an inactive SCT code due to the incorrect designation code association.
  
 4. When selecting the ICD-9 diagnosis code V65.49 from the TELEPHONE 
 DIAGNOSES section of the National Telephone encounter form dialog, the 
 selected diagnosis code does not appear under the Selected Diagnoses 
 section for confirmation of selection. This issue only occurs when the 
 user tries to select a diagnosis which has similar codes but different 
 descriptions and are listed sequentially on the form. In the reported 
 scenario, the user tried to select one or both of the V65.49 codes which 
 were listed sequentially after one another with two different 
 descriptions, COUNSELING W/OUT SICKNESS and HEALTH ADVICE INSTRUCTIONS. 
 As a result the selected diagnoses did not appear under the Selected 
 Diagnoses section of the dialog.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 1. The restriction has been removed so that users can now annotate any 
 problem regardless of the current active coding system and without having 
 to update the problem first.
  
 2. CPRS will register and export the two GN RPC's on the GUI CHART option
 for GN. IOC GN sites will no longer have to manually register the RPC's
 with every CPRS GUI iteration install.
  
 3. This has been resolved so that the correct SCT concept and designation 
 codes are retrieved, saved, and stored appropriately when adding a SCT 
 problem from a user selection list.
  
 4. This bug has been resolved so that upon selection of an ICD-9 
 diagnosis (which has similar codes but different descriptions and are 
 sequentially listed) on the encounter form dialog, it will appear under 
 the Selected Diagnoses section of the dialog.
