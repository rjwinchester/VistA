 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. INC0371095 - Option PSSJI DRUG (Additives) Issues
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 When invoking Additives File [PSSJI DRUG] option and if the selected 
 additive is defined to have "UNIT DOSE MEDICATIONS" usage set as "Quick
 Order only" in the ORDERABLE ITEMS (#101.43) file, one of two errors will
 occur.
  
    1) The first error encountered results in the removal of the
       designation as an additive in the ORDERABLE ITEMS (#101.43) file,
       which renders the additive unorderable in both CPRS and VistA.
  
    2) The second error encountered after invoking the PSSJI DRUG option 
       again for the same additive, results in restoration of the
       designation as an additive in the ORDERABLE ITEMS (#101.43) file,
       but fails to restore any "IV ADDITIVES" or "IV MEDICATIONS" quick
       order restrictions that may have originally been in place.
  
 If the usage "UNIT DOSE MEDICATIONS" is not defined as "Quick Order Only"
 but the "IV ADDITIVES" and/or "IV MEDICATIONS" usages are defined as
 "Quick Order Only", an error does not occur.  However, the "Quick Order
 Only" restriction(s) are removed from the corresponding ORDERABLE ITEMS
 (#101.43) file entry.
  
 2. INC0292614: Option PSSJI SOLN (Solutions) Issues
 Problem 2:
 --------- 
 When invoking "Primary Solution File (IV) [PSSJI SOLN]" option and if the
 selected solution is defined to have "UNIT DOSE MEDICATIONS" usage set as
 "Quick Order only" in the ORDERABLE ITEMS (#101.43) file, one of two
 errors will occur.
  
    1) The first error encountered results in the removal of the 
       designation as a solution in the ORDERABLE ITEMS (#101.43) file,
       which renders the solution unorderable in both CPRS and VistA.
  
    2) The second error encountered after invoking PSSJI SOLN again for 
       the same solution results in restoration of the designation as a
       solution in the ORDERABLE ITEMS (#101.43) file, but fails to restore
       any "IV SOLUTIONS" or "IV MEDICATIONS" quick order restrictions that
       may have originally been in place.
  
 If the usage "UNIT DOSE MEDICATIONS" is not defined as "Quick Order Only"
 but the "IV SOLUTIONS" and/or "IV MEDICATIONS" usages are defined as
 "Quick Order Only", an error does not occur.  However, the "Quick Order
 Only" restriction(s) are removed from the corresponding ORDERABLE ITEMS
 (#101.43) file entry.
  
 Resolution 1 & 2:
 -----------------
 Modified routines PSSVIDRG and ORMFN to prevent the errors and also 
 preserve quick order settings on additives and solutions.  
  
 NOTE: Routine PSSVIDRG is included in patch PSS*1.0*229 which will be
 installed before this patch.
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   Install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: The companion patch to this patch is PSS*1.0*229. PSS*1.0*229 must
         be installed before OR*3.0*487.
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time. You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'OR*3.0*487'.
  
       When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
       Install? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
       When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
       When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Compare the checksum of routine ORMFN to the "After" checksum listed in
 the patch description.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make 
 the decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 ORMFN included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine ORMFN from the backup
 created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
