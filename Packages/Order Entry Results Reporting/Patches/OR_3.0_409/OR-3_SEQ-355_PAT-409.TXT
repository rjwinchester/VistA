    Additional Dose Now is selected.
  
 Associated Remedy Ticket(s):

 Remedy Overview:
 ===============
 1. INC000000069833
  
    Problem:
    --------
    This patch corrects a bug in the Computerized Record System (CPRS)
    where if an Inpatient order with a Treating Specialty is renewed, the
    renewed order will lose the original Treating Specialty. Also, if Give
    Additional Dose Now is selected on a new order, the resulting order
    will lose its Treating Specialty when signed.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Changed ORWDXR so that the Treating Specialty is preserved when the
    order is renewed. Changed ORCSEND3 so that the Treating Specialty is
    preserved when Give Additional Dose Now is selected.
