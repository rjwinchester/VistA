 SD*5.3*704 adds a new field to the Appointment multiple in the Hospital 
 Location File (#44) to store the Veteran Video Call (VVC) URL. The field 
 is populated when the tele health appointment is created in VistA by the 
 TMP app.
  
 This patch adds functionality to CPRS to display the URL for the tele 
 health appointment video conference call when the user clicks on the 
 appointment in the appointment window on the CPRS cover sheet. 
  
 If end users/customers need TMP technical support during Go Live or 
 anytime thereafter, they can reach out to the National Telehealth 
 Technology Help Desk (NTTHD) at 866-651-3180 or via email at 
 VHA_NTTHD@domain.ext.

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.  No
 data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no rollback
 strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum matches
 the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
  
 Patch Installation:
 -------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
