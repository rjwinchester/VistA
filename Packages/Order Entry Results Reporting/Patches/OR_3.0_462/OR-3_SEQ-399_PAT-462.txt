Subject: REGULAR DIET QUICK ORDERS, FLAGGED MED ORDERS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch OR*3.0*462 addresses these 2 issues:
  
 1. If a user edits an existing diet Quick Order using the Enter/Edit 
 quick orders option [ORCM QUICK ORDERS], the system allows a REGULAR/NPO
 diet to be ordered with another diet.
  
 2.  Medication orders flagged by a pharmacist that are then 
 updated by the pharmacists cannot then be un-flagged in CPRS or the 
 Inpatient Order Entry option [PSJ OE].

 ==========================================
  
 1. I10009975FY16 - QO allows regular diet to ordered with another diet on 
                    edit.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If a user edits an existing diet Quick order using the Enter/Edit quick 
 orders option [ORCM QUICK ORDERS], the system allows a REGULAR/NPO diet to
 be ordered with another diet.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The validation logic has been changed to not allow REGULAR/NPO diet 
 orders to be ordered with other diets.
  
 Routine ORCDFH1 has been modified to set the TOTAL variable properly on 
 an edit. ORCDFH1 has also been modified to check if the current diet is 
 regular, and if so, to not allow other diets to be ordered with it.
  
 Created a post-install routine, ORY462, to identify existing Quick Orders 
 that have both a regular diet and another diet. This routine will send a 
 mailman message to the user letting them know that the quick order needs 
 to be manually corrected. The format of the message is as follows:
  
 Subj: OR*3.0*386 install routine has completed [#149762]
 03/19/14@15:10 5 lines
 From: ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING PACKAGE In 'IN' basket. Page 1
 *New*
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
  
 OR*3.0*462 install routine has completed.
  
 The following Diet Quick orders have both a Regular/NPO and another
 diet.
  
 They must be manually edited.
  
 (1st quick order here) IEN - (internal entry# here)
 (2nd quick order here) IEN - (internal entry# here)
 (And so on...)
  
 <OR if no such Quick Orders are found>
 "None Found." 
  
  
 2. I10480945FY16 - NORTHAMPTON: CPRS issues - FLAGGED MED ORDER
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Inpatient medication orders accepted and flagged by a pharmacist that are 
 then updated by the pharmacists (for example: editing Special 
 Instructions) no longer show as flagged in CPRS and cannot then be 
 un-flagged in CPRS or the Inpatient Order Entry option [PSJ OE].
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When the order is updated in the backdoor (for example: after the 
 pharmacist edits the Special Instructions), an active flag attached to 
 the existing order action record is copied forward into the new order.
  
 After the replacement order is created (RO^ORMPS2), the ORDER file is 
 checked to see if the previous order action has an active flag. If so, 
 this flag is copied to the new order action.
  
 Patch Installation:
 ===================
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 N/A
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------
 This patch can be loaded with users in the system but it is recommended 
 that it be installed when user activity is low.  Installation time will 
 be less than 2 minutes.
    
    1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
        INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
    
    2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
   
    3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*462)
   
         a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
             transport global.
         b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
             the components of the KIDS build.
         c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when this 
             patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
             (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
         d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
             message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
             backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
       OR*3.0*462.
  
    5. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//", respond NO.  
   
    6. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//", respond NO.
  
 Installation Verification
 -------------------------
 Successful installation can be verified by reviewing the first
 2 lines of the routines contained in the patch. The second line
 will contain the patch number in the [PATCH LIST] section.
  
 ;;7.0;OUTPATIENT PHARMACY;**[PATCH LIST]**;DEC 1997;Build 349 
  
 The option Calculate and Show Checksum Values [XTSUMBLD-CHECK] 
 can be run to compare the routine checksums to what is documented
 in the patch description.
  
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 Back-out will be done only with the concurrence and participation
 of development team and appropriate VA site/region personnel. The
 decision to back-out or rollback software will be a joint decision
 between development team, VA site/region personnel and other
 appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Prior to installing an updated KIDS package, the site/region should
 have saved a backup of the routines in a mail message using the
 Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] menu option (this is done at
 time of install). The message containing the backed up routines can
 be loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action
 prompt. The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used
 to install the backed up routines onto the VistA System. 
  
 Validation of Roll Back Procedure
 ---------------------------------
 The Roll Back Procedure can be verified by printing the first 2
 lines of the PSO Routines contained in this patch using the option
 First Line Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the routines
 contained in the OR*3*462 patch have been rolled back, the first
 two lines of the Routines will no longer contain the designation
 of patch OR*3*462 in the patch list section on line 2.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;3.0;ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING;**[Patch List]**;Dec 17, 1997;Build 6
