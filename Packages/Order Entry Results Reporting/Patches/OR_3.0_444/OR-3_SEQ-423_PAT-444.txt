Description:
============

 **Note: This functionality is delivered with an On/Off switch parameter. 
 (OR UNIFIED ACTION PROFILE OFF). The default setting is Off. Do not switch
 this feature On until CPRS v.32 (OR*3.0*405) has been released and 
 successfully installed.
  
 OR*3.0*444 enables a clinician to view existing inpatient and outpatient
 medication orders from the local site on a single page when preparing to
 discharge a patient. This order information is displayed on a new Unified
 Action Profile (UAP) form available from the View menu on the Computerized
 Patient Record System (CPRS) Orders tab.
  
 Duplicate orders can occur because outpatient orders remain in the system 
 after a patient is admitted, and new inpatient orders are created after 
 admission. When discharging a patient, a clinician must review all orders 
 to avoid duplication, while ensuring the correct medication orders are 
 continued for patient safety and care. The clinician must take the 
 appropriate action for each medication order, deciding whether to 
 continue, change, renew, or discontinue the order prior to discharge.
  
 Previously, when preparing to discharge a patient, a clinician had to 
 switch between forms in order to review all medication orders. OR*3.0*444 
 enables the clinician to review all medication orders at one time from the
 new UAP form. This change both simplifies order reconciliation and reduces
 the time and effort required from the clinician when making decisions on
 each active inpatient and outpatient order. The UAP sorts orders by the
 first orderable item name from the Orderable Items file (#101.43), so that
 inpatient and outpatient medications are grouped together. Sorting orders
 by the orderable item name ensures that the clinician sees all existing
 orders for each drug when making decisions during reconciliation.
  
 Note: The Order Text field (#100.0081) in the Order file (#100) is a word 
 processing field that is generated when an order is created. Additional 
 Order Text fields are added each time the order is modified. When working 
 with an order in CPRS, the content of the most recent Order Text field is 
 displayed. UAP checks the first line of the Order Text field against the 
 orderable item name. If this check detects that the first line of the 
 Order Text field does not match the orderable item name, then the order is
 sorted based on the first line of the most recent Order Text field.
  
 In the UAP view, Infusions are sorted alphabetically by the first 
 orderable item identified as an additive; solutions are ignored for the 
 purpose of sorting. The orderable items that display are reorganized based
 on the orderable additive item used for sorting. This change supports
 alphabetical sorting by a meaningful additive in the UAP, but does not
 change the original order in the ORDER file (#100). Infusions usually have
 more than one orderable item and sorting by the first additive ensures a
 consistent alphabetized display of infusion orders in the UAP view.
  
 Infusion orders cannot be continued, changed, or renewed using UAP because
 CPRS does not convert inpatient infusion orders to an outpatient order
 when preparing for discharge. To prevent issues with discharge medication
 orders, these options are grayed when performing UAP medication
 reconciliation for an inpatient Infusion order.
  
 Note: When an order is modified by a pharmacist during prescription 
 processing, the order is marked with an asterisk when displayed in CPRS. 
 In the UAP view, this asterisk is hidden when displaying orders; this 
 preserves the alphabetical sorting critical to the reconciliation process.
  
 The UAP includes a Reviewed column that displays the decision made by the 
 clinician during review. A new "UAP Reviewed?" field (#.61) is added to
 the order record in the ORDER file (#100). This field denotes whether an
 order was reviewed ("1") or not reviewed ("0"). Two additional fields
 store information about previous reviews: the "UAP Last Reviewed" 
 field (#.62) stores the date an order was last reviewed using the UAP
 form; the "UAP Last Reviewed By" field (#.63) stores identification
 information for the last person to perform a review of the order using the
 UAP view.
  
 This enhancement also adds a Discharge Meds Review form, which provides a 
 summary of all medications being continued for the patient upon discharge.
 This form is accessed by selecting the Discharge Meds view from the Orders
 tab. The Discharge Meds Review form enables a clinician to see the full
 list of medications prescribed for a discharged patient after the UAP
 review is completed.
  
 This modification includes a new PHARMACY UAP Display Group, which 
 includes the display members INPATIENT MEDICATIONS, OUTPATIENT 
 MEDICATIONS, and NON-VA MEDICATIONS. If expected orders do not display in 
 the UAP view, additional display members can be added to the group. For 
 example, Supply orders are omitted from the UAP view by design, but they 
 can be displayed if the SUPPLY Display Group is added as a member of the 
 PHARMACY UAP Display Group. To add additional display group members to the
 PHAMACY UAP Display Group, contact OIT for assistance; access to VistA
 programmer mode and FileMan are required to modify display group members.
  
 A new parameter (OR UNIFIED ACTION PROFILE OFF) in VistA enables sites to 
 turn the UAP functionality On/Off. This parameter is set at the facility 
 level and is located in the PARAMETER DEFINITION file (#8989.51). 
 Initially, this parameter is set to OFF ("0"). When the parameter is set 
 to OFF, the two options used to access the Unified Action Profile 
 functionality (Unified Action Profile (UAP) and Discharge Meds) are not
 displayed on the CPRS View menu. To enable this functionality, set the
 parameter to ON ("1") using the Edit Parameter Values function accessible
 from the XPAR MENU TOOLS option in VistA.
  
 **Note: In addition to turning this new parameter ON, enabling UAP 
 requires changing two settings for the Discharge Release Event using the 
 CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) menu in VistA. Both settings are 
 accessible from the Event Delayed Orders option. First, activate the 
 DISCHARGE Release Event by changing the Activate/Inactivate [AI] setting 
 to ACTIVATE. Second, disable Copy Active Orders by changing the Copy 
 Active Orders setting to NO. The medication reconciliation performed by 
 UAP will not function as intended until the parameter is turned ON and 
 these settings are configured. Refer to the Post-Installation Instructions
 in this document for an example of how to modify these settings.

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 **Note: This functionality requires CPRS v.32. Do not perform the 
 following configuration steps until CPRS v.32 (OR*3.0*405) has been 
 released and successfully installed.
  
 The functionality enabled by this patch requires that the feature Copy 
 Active Orders is disabled and the Discharge Release Events is Activated.
 Both configuration settings are controlled using the CPRS Clinical
 Coordinator's menu in VistA.
  
 From the CPRS Clinical Coordinator's menu in VistA:
  
 1. At the prompt, type "PE" to display CPRS Configuration (Clin Coord) 
 options.
  
 2. At the prompt, type "DO" to display the Event Delayed Orders Menu.
  
 3. At the prompt, type "DO" to display Delayed Orders/Auto-DC Set-up 
 options.
  
 4. Select option 2, Release Events, to display a list of available Release
 events.
  
 5. At the prompt, type "DD" from the list of actions to open the Detailed
 Display.
  
 6. Select option 10, DISCHARGE, as the Release Event.
  
 7. At the prompt, type "AI" to Activate/Inactivate the Discharge Event.
 Confirm the selection to ACTIVATE at the "Are you sure you want to
 ACTIVATE this entry? NO//YES" prompt by pressing Enter.
  
 8. At the prompt, type "AE" to ADD/EDIT the Discharge event. 
  
 9. Press Enter to move through the remaining prompts until the COPY ACTIVE
 ORDERS prompt displays. Enter "NO" to disable Copy Active Orders. Verify
 Copy Active Orders is set to NO.
  
 10. The Write Orders List by Event options display, followed by the "Enter
 selection:" prompt. This selection determines which users are affected by
 the change. For example, to apply this setting to all CPRS users at a
 particular site, type "System" at the prompt. Limit how broadly this
 setting applies by selecting an alternate choice of User, Location,
 Service, Division, instead of System.
  
 Note: The PHARMACY UAP Display Group is delivered with the members 
 INPATIENT MEDICATIONS, OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS, and NON-VA MEDICATIONS. If 
 additional members must be added to this display group, contact OIT for 
 assistance.
  
 The OIT representative must add new display group members to the PHARMACY 
 UAP Display Group file (#100.98) using the following steps:
  
   1. Log in to VistA in programmer mode and then navigate to FileMan.
  
   2. Select the ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES option.
  
   3. At the "Input to what File: OPTION//" prompt, type DISPLAY GROUP.

      member to the PHARMACY UAP Display Group.
  
   8. At the "Are you adding 'CLINIC MEDICATIONS' as a new MEMBER? No//"
      prompt, type Y (Yes).
  
   9. At the MEMBER SEQUENCE: 4//" prompt, press Enter to accept the 
      default. Note: The member sequence is not used by the UAP code
      modification.
  
  10. Repeat these steps to add each required display group to the 
      PHARMACY UAP Display Group file.
  
  
 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of this patch, it is not recommended for 
 backout, and a restore from a backup of the Transport Global should not be
 attempted. However, in the event that a site decides to back out this
 patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit a
 help desk ticket. The development team will need to issue one or more 
 follow-on patches in order to comprehensively back out this patch, 
 after coordination with the VA Project Manager and COR.
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the OR routines contained in this patch using the option First Line
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the OR routines have been backed
 out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain the
 designation of patch OR*3.0*444 on line 2 in the patch list section.
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out; it does not confirm that other patch component changes 
 have been backed out.
