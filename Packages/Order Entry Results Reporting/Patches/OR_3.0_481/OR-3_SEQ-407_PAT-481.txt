============

 Description:
 ===========
  
 The Medication Order Check HealthCare Application (MOCHA) 2.1B patches 
 implement Max Daily Dose Order Checks for simple medication orders 
 entered through Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), Inpatient 
 Medications and Outpatient Pharmacy. If the Daily Dose exceeds the First 
 Databank (FDB) recommended Max Daily Dose, a warning shall be displayed 
 to the user. If the Max Daily Dose Order Check cannot be performed, an 
 error message will be displayed to the user, along with general dosing 
 information for the drug in most cases.
  
 This patch is part of warranty period & minor fixes for the MOCHA 
 Enhancements 2.1B group of builds. A multiple package host file was

 facilities for the other portions. The combined host file

 PSO*7.0*518. In addition, there is this standalone Pharmacy Data
 Management patch, PSS*1.0*224, which must be installed in conjunction with
 the other builds.
