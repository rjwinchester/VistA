Package : OR - ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING  Priority: Mandatory
Version : 3       SEQ #334                      Status: Released

Associated patches: (v)OR*3*311    <<= must be installed BEFORE `OR*3*384'

Subject: MOCHA DOSING ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 1) Upon initial entry of a Drug order in CPRS with a free text dosage, 
    the dosage check is performed appropriately.  However, when taking 
    the copy or change action in CPRS on that same order, upon accepting 
    the order, no dosing checks are performed.  This issue has been 
    resolved so that the dosing order checks are consistently performed 
    for all drug actions where appropriate.
  
 2) When the copy or change action in CPRS on a drug order that originally
    had a Possible Dosage selected as the dosage, but changing it to a free
    text dosage upon copy/change, the orignial Possible Dosage was used to 
    perform the dosing check which was not correct.  This issue has been 
    resolved such that the new free text dosage is used to perform the 
    dosing check in this scenario.
  
 3) If a preceding or trailing space could be automatically stripped off of
    a dosage before being evaluated for dosing checks, then unknowing 
    providers could be spared of the aggravation of a manual warning 
    message for an improperly formatted free text dose.
  
    When reviewing test site reports, space issues have been identified are
    a fairly common issue:
    <space>1 TABLET 
    1 TABLET<space> 
    1 TABLET<space space> 
    10mg<space> 
    and so on.
  
    First - these could be entered by the provider.
    Second - these could be older orders that were copied/changed and had
    the spaces added
