Description:
============

 The following issues are addressed by this patch:
  
 1. OR*3*389 added a new utility to convert Unit Dose and IV Medication 
 quick orders to Clinic Orders. 'Create Clinic Order QOs from Inpatient 
 QOs' [OR CONV INPT QO TO CLIN ORD QO]. This utility also allows the 
 user to delete a given quick order after a copy has been made. This same
 patch also restored the ability to delete a quick order from the
 'Enter/edit quick orders ' [ORCM QUICK ORDERS utility.]
  
 Both utilities use the same underlying logic for the delete 
 operation. There was a flaw in this logic where the delete operation 
 was not finding the orders placed using the selected order dialog. 
 This has now been corrected. Jazz 356443
  
 2. An issue was discovered with consult/procedure auto-accept quick 
 orders and Clinically Indicated Date (CID). If the CID is blank, and all 
 other required fields are pre-populated, the quick order will be accepted 
 by the system. This results in an order without a CID value. The consult 
 and procedure order dialogs (GMRCOR CONSULT and GMRCOR REQUEST) have been 
 updated to set the CID response as required. Additionally, coding logic 
 for processing order dialogs has been modified to validate if the CID is 
 valued or not and ensure the order dialog in CPRS will be displayed when 
 necessary. Jazz 338586
  
 3. An issue was reported with the DSS DataBridge not being able to be 
 notified appropriately when a nursing order was completed via CPRS. This 
 patch addresses this problem by creating a new protocol: OR COMPLETE 
 ORDER, which will be invoked whenever an order is marked complete. Any 
 application or product that needs to be notified of complete orders may 
 subscribe to this protocol. PSPO 2563 Jazz 328335
  
 4. A request was made, during testing of supply orders, that all supply 
 orders, regardless of how they were entered, should display in the supply 
 display group. In addition, an issue was reported with edits made to 
 supply orders during finishing. When an edit occurred, the supply order 
 would revert to the outpatient medication display group. This patch 
 corrects both these issues by ensuring any dispense drug that is a supply 
 drug, displays in the supply display group. Jazz 329491, 258326, and 
 303788
  
 5. CPRS GUI v30b (OR*3.0*350) introduced a new security key, ORSUPPLY. The
 purpose of this key is to identify those non-provider users who are
 allowed to order supplies using the PSO SUPPLY order dialog. This patch,
 OR*3.0*397, will add the ORSUPPLY key to the list of security keys that
 may be assigned via the Allocate OE/RR Security Keys [ORCL KEY
 ALLOCATION]. Jazz 298588
  
 6. As part of the installation of patch OR*3*350 (CPRS v30b), all 
 Outpatient Medication quick orders that were built for orderable items 
 that were considered supply items were converted to the PSO SUPPLY dialog.
 However, because of issues that were found with the PSO SUPPLY dialog,
 patch OR*3*423 (CPRS v30c) reversed that, and moved them back to use the
 Outpatient Medication (PSO OERR) dialog. This patch corrects the PSO
 SUPPLY dialog issues. Therefore, a new option, CONVERT SUPPLY QUICK ORDERS
 [OR SUPPLY QO CONVERSION], is being added to the SUPPLY COVERSION UTILITY
 MENU [OR SUPPLY UTIL MENU]. When (if) a site wishes to move their supply
 quick orders back to the PSO SUPPLY dialog, this option can be used to
 accomplish that. Jazz 581005
  
 7. An issue was reported that a nurse without the ORSUPPLY key can enter 
 and release a supply order if the encounter provider is someone other than
 themselves, and is authorized to write med orders. This patch adds checks
 when releasing a supply order to make sure the user releasing the order
 has the ORSUPPLY key or is authorized to write med orders. It also blocks 
 the user from releasing the supply order as verbal or telephone. Jazz
 313956
  
 8. An issue was reported that a user with the ORES, PROVIDER, and 
 ORSUPPLY keys (without authorization to write meds) was not able to place 
 a supply quick order. This issue will be fixed with this patch. Jazz 
 258733
  
 9. An issue was reported that supply orders were not able to be renewed. 
 This will be fixed with this patch. Jazz 473803 SDM R11123709FY17 
  
 10. An issue was found that a user without the ORSUPPLY key (and without 
 authorization to write meds) was able to place a supply quick order that 
 was set to auto accept. This will be fixed with this patch. Jazz 812936
  
 11. An issue was reported that Clinic Infusions quick orders do not get
 prompted to Auto Accept. This will be fixed with this patch. Jazz 413439
  
 12. An issue was found that the 'D' cross-reference on the ORDER file 
 (#100) was not always getting set. This patch will fix that and will task 
 off a job in the post-install to rebuild the 'D' cross-reference. Jazz 
 356440
  
 13. Problem with statuses not being updated properly when a VBECS order 
 was discontinued. SDM R13286486FY17
  
 14. An issue was reported that when renewing a supply Order in CPRS, the 
 system was not allowing the user to change refills or pick-up. This will
 be fixed with this patch. Jazz 1013616
  
 15. An issue was found that when a supply order is entered via CPRS and 
 changed in backdoor pharmacy, when the Order (#100) is updated, the DIALOG
 field changes from PSO SUPPLY to PSO OERR. This will be fixed with this
 patch. Jazz 1013631

 R11123709FY17 (Original)
 R13286486FY17 
  
 1. R11123709FY17 - Supply order can not be renewed
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When trying to renew a supply order, the user receives an error: "Unable 
 to renew order".
  
 Solution:
 --------
 Modified routine ORCACT01 to allow a supply order to be renewed.
  
 2. R13286486FY17 - VBECS order not discontinuing completely.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Blood Bank order is being discontinued, but not updating status 
 appropriately - order is Dc'd, but still says pending in CPRS and VBECS, 
 but order is canceled in VistA. If you cancel the order in VBECS you can 
 re-cancel the VistA order again - which updates CPRS as dc'd. The 
 provider still thinks an order is pending, but we can't do anything with 
 the order in VBECS/VistA.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Routine ORCSAVE was modified to appropriately discontinue all components 
 of a multi-part blood bank order. (Jazz 529132)

 --------------------------
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
     Installation Menu. From this menu, you may also elect to use the
     following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter
     OR*3.0*397:
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch

 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//', press Enter to accept the default.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//', press Enter to accept the default. 
  
 8.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 A post install routine, ORY397A, is included to rebuild the 'D' 
 cross-reference for the ORDER file (#100). Since this process can be 
 intensive in regards to the usage of journal files, it has been written 
 to task itself off and only process a certain number of records before 
 pausing for five minutes. This means the process will most likely take
 several days to complete. Upon completion, the job will send a message to
 the CPRS development team to let them know.
  
 The routine is also set up to honor requests to stop from TaskMan.
  
 If you encounter any errors in ORY397A or you find it necessary to stop 
 the task due to system issues or journal file problems, please log a 
 defect ticket so we can assist in resolving the issue and completing the 
 rebuild of the 'D' cross-reference.
  
 ***IMPORTANT NOTE***
 Please make a note of the task number when the job is started. You will 
 need this if a situation occurs where you need to stop the job.
  
  
 Back-Out Plan
 =============
 In the event of a major issue with the patch, the Facility Chief 
 Information Officer (FCIO) may make the decision to back-out the patch.
 However, this decision should include both Health Product Support and the
 CPRS development team.
  
 Prior to installing this patch, the site/region should have saved a backup
 of the routines in a mail message using the Backup a Transport Global [XPD
 BACKUP] menu option (this is done at time of install).
  
 Back-out Procedures
 -------------------
 1. Back-Out Routines: The message containing the backed up routines can be
 loaded with the "Xtract PackMan" function at the Message Action prompt.
 The Packman function "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" is then used to install the
 backed up routines onto the VistA System.
  
 2. Back-Out Other Components: The CPRS development team has created a 
 patch to back-out other (non-routine) components. Please request this 
 patch from the CPRS development team and install it.
