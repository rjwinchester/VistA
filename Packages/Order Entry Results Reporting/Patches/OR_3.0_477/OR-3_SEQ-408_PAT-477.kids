This patch addresses two (2) issues:
"BLD",10808,1,2,0)
 
"BLD",10808,1,3,0)
1.  The PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) NAME field (#.01) is

    not always synced with ORDERABLE ITEM file (#101.43) NAME field
"BLD",10808,1,5,0)
    (#.01).
"BLD",10808,1,6,0)
2.  Room-Bed default printer parameters are ignored during the ordering 
"BLD",10808,1,7,0)
    process.

   Problem: 
"BLD",10808,1,15,0)
   --------
"BLD",10808,1,16,0)
   The PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#50.7) NAME field (#.01) is  
"BLD",10808,1,17,0)
   not always synced with the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43) NAME
"BLD",10808,1,18,0)
   field (#.01).
"BLD",10808,1,19,0)
 
"BLD",10808,1,20,0)
   The NAME field (#.01) in the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43) is  
"BLD",10808,1,21,0)
   a combination of the NAME field (#.01), max length 40, in the 
"BLD",10808,1,22,0)
   PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#50.7) and the NAME field (#.01), 
"BLD",10808,1,23,0)
   max length 30, in the DOSAGE FORM file (#50.606).  There is a  
"BLD",10808,1,24,0)
   space between the two fields and a space at the end of the field.
"BLD",10808,1,25,0)
   This could produce a NAME that is 72 characters in length.  
"BLD",10808,1,26,0)
 
"BLD",10808,1,27,0)
   The problem is that the maximum length for the NAME field (#.01)
"BLD",10808,1,28,0)
   in the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43) is 63 characters.  This  
"BLD",10808,1,29,0)
   can result in truncation, as well as failed update "pushes" when  
"BLD",10808,1,30,0)
   the combination of the Pharmacy Orderable Items Name and Dosage
"BLD",10808,1,31,0)
   Form Name is greater than 63 characters.
"BLD",10808,1,32,0)
 
"BLD",10808,1,33,0)
   The maximum field length for the NAME field (#.01) in the 
"BLD",10808,1,34,0)
   ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43) needs to be increased to 72 
"BLD",10808,1,35,0)
   characters.
"BLD",10808,1,36,0)
 
"BLD",10808,1,37,0)
   Resolution:
"BLD",10808,1,38,0)
   -----------
"BLD",10808,1,39,0)
   A Data Dictionary update has been made to the NAME Field (#.01) in 
"BLD",10808,1,40,0)
   the ORDERABLE ITEM file (#101.43) to increase the maximum field 
"BLD",10808,1,41,0)
   length limit to 72 characters.

2. I17614498FY18 - ROOM-BED PRINT DEVICE PARAMETER ISSUES
"BLD",10808,1,44,0)
   
"BLD",10808,1,45,0)
   Problem:
"BLD",10808,1,46,0)
   --------
"BLD",10808,1,47,0)
 
"BLD",10808,1,48,0)
   If a default label printer is defined for a Room-Bed using any of the
"BLD",10808,1,49,0)
   parameters "ORPF CHART COPY PRINT DEVICE ", "ORPF LABEL PRINT DEVICE",
"BLD",10808,1,50,0)
   "ORPF REQUISITION PRINT DEVICE" and "ORPF WORK COPY PRINT DEVICE", the
"BLD",10808,1,51,0)
   parameter setting is ignored during the CPRS ordering process.
"BLD",10808,1,52,0)
 
"BLD",10808,1,53,0)
   Resolution:
"BLD",10808,1,54,0)
   -----------
"BLD",10808,1,55,0)
 
"BLD",10808,1,56,0)
   Modify routine ORWD2 to determine whether a "device" parameter
"BLD",10808,1,57,0)
   definition exists for the patient's Room-Bed. The "device" parameter 
"BLD",10808,1,58,0)
   descriptions were updated to clarify that the location(s) for each 
"BLD",10808,1,59,0)
   Room-Bed must have the corresponding "prompt" parameter defined in
"BLD",10808,1,60,0)
   order for the Room-Bed device to display.  The CPRS Technical Manual
"BLD",10808,1,61,0)
   was also updated to include that clarification.

"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,2,0)
 
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,3,0)
1.  The PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) NAME field (#.01) is

    not always synced with ORDERABLE ITEM file (#101.43) NAME field
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,5,0)
    (#.01).
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,6,0)
2.  Room-Bed default printer parameters are ignored during the ordering

"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,13,0)
 
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,14,0)
   Problem: 
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,15,0)
   --------
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,16,0)
   The PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#50.7) NAME field (#.01) is  
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,17,0)
   not always synced with the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43) NAME
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,18,0)
   field (#.01).
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,19,0)
 
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,20,0)
   The NAME field (#.01) in the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43) is  
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,21,0)
   a combination of the NAME field (#.01), max length 40, in the 
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,22,0)
   PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#50.7) and the NAME field (#.01), 
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,23,0)
   max length 30, in the DOSAGE FORM file (#50.606).  There is a  
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,24,0)
   space between the two fields and a space at the end of the field.
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,25,0)
   This could produce a NAME that is 72 characters in length.  
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,26,0)
 
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,27,0)
   The problem is that the maximum length for the NAME field (#.01)
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,28,0)
   in the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43) is 63 characters.  This  
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,29,0)
   can result in truncation, as well as failed update "pushes" when  
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,30,0)
   the combination of the Pharmacy Orderable Items Name and Dosage
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,31,0)
   Form Name is greater than 63 characters.
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,32,0)
 
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,33,0)
   The maximum field length for the NAME field (#.01) in the 
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,34,0)
   ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43) needs to be increased to 72 
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,35,0)
   characters.
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,36,0)

   Resolution:
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,38,0)
   -----------
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,39,0)
   A Data Dictionary update has been made to the NAME Field (#.01) in 
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,40,0)
   the ORDERABLE ITEM file (#101.43) to increase the maximum field 
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,41,0)
   length limit to 72 characters.

"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,50,0)

   Modify routine ORWD2 to determine whether a "device" parameter
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,57,0)
   definition exists for the patient's Room-Bed. The "device" parameter 
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,58,0)
   descriptions were updated to clarify that the location(s) for each 
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,59,0)
   Room-Bed must have the corresponding "prompt" parameter defined in
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,60,0)
   order for the Room-Bed device to display.  The CPRS Technical Manual
"PKG",188,22,1,"PAH",1,1,61,0)
   was also updated to include that clarification.
