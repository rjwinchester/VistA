Description:
============

 This patch addresses two (2) issues:
  
 1.  The PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) NAME field (#.01) is 
     not always synced with ORDERABLE ITEM file (#101.43) NAME field
     (#.01).
 2.  Room-Bed default printer parameters are ignored during the ordering 
     process.

 1. I7370452FY16 - PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEMS / ORDERABLE ITEMS
    I10581756FY16 (d) 
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    The PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#50.7) NAME field (#.01) is  
    not always synced with the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43) NAME
    field (#.01).
  
    The NAME field (#.01) in the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43) is  
    a combination of the NAME field (#.01), max length 40, in the 
    PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#50.7) and the NAME field (#.01), 
    max length 30, in the DOSAGE FORM file (#50.606).  There is a  
    space between the two fields and a space at the end of the field.
    This could produce a NAME that is 72 characters in length.  
  
    The problem is that the maximum length for the NAME field (#.01)
    in the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43) is 63 characters.  This  
    can result in truncation, as well as failed update "pushes" when  
    the combination of the Pharmacy Orderable Items Name and Dosage
    Form Name is greater than 63 characters.
  
    The maximum field length for the NAME field (#.01) in the ORDERABLE
    ITEMS file (#101.43) needs to be increased to 72 characters.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A Data Dictionary update has been made to the NAME Field (#.01) in 
    the ORDERABLE ITEM file (#101.43) to increase the maximum field 
    length limit to 72 characters.
  
 2. I17614498FY18 - ROOM-BED PRINT DEVICE PARAMETER ISSUES
    
    Problem:
    --------
  
    If a default label printer is defined for a Room-Bed using any of the
    parameters "ORPF CHART COPY PRINT DEVICE ", "ORPF LABEL PRINT DEVICE",
    "ORPF REQUISITION PRINT DEVICE" and "ORPF WORK COPY PRINT DEVICE", the
    parameter setting is ignored during the CPRS ordering process.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
  
    Modify routine ORWD2 to determine whether a parameter definition 
    exists for the patient's Room-Bed. The "device" parameter descriptions 
    were updated to clarify that the location(s) for each Room-Bed must
    have the corresponding "prompt" parameter defined in order for the
    Room-Bed device to display.  The CPRS Technical Manual was also updated
    to include that clarification.
