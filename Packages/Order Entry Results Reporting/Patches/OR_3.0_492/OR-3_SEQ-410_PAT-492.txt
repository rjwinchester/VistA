Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 ServiceNow Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------  
 INC1506496 - Discontinued lab labels being printed and then disposed of
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1.  Defect 784555(ServiceNow INC1506496 - LAB LABELS INCORRECTLY PRINTED
  
 Problem:
 -------
 After signing a lab order when print parameters have been defined the Print
 Orders window displays and allows selection of multiple print items.  When any
 of the items are checked to print and the button to Print All Checked Items or
 Print Highlighted Items Only (and any item(s) are pre-checked) or the window is
 closed (x), all items will print instead of only the checked item(s).
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modify RPC 'RVPRINT ORWD1' (routine ORWD1) to only print the item(s) that have
 a print device passed into the RPC corresponding to the checked item(s).  The 
 routine will still print using the default printers when not called from CPRS.  
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 Upstate New York - Western NY HCS (Buffalo, Buffalo, Canandaigua, 
 Syracuse, Bath, Albany)

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 -------------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions
