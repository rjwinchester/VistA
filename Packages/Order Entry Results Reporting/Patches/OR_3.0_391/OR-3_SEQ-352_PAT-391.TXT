Description:
============

 This patch extends the existing list of ICD-9-CM indications for care in
 support of Anticoagulation Management, to include a number of common
 diagnoses that were excluded from the original list. It also introduces
 a new set of indications for care, using the ICD-10-CM classification
 system, which will be presented to the user after ICD-10-CM implementation
 (currently scheduled for 10/01/2015) in lieu of the ICD-9-CM indications.
 In addition to the Automatic Primary Indication for Care configurable by
 Clinic for the original version of AMT, facilities will also be able to
 specify an Automatic Secondary Indication, using ICD-9-CM, along with
 Automatic Primary and Secondary ICD-10-CM Indications, which will be used
 for visits which occur after ICD-10-CM implementation.
  
 The following tables present the list of additional indications for care 
 from which the user can select when the corresponding coding systems are
 active.

 The ICD-10-CM codes corresponding to the ICD-9-CM indications used since 
 2008 were identified using the General Equivalence Mappings, which are
 developed and maintained by The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
 (CMS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Note that
 the indication "Hypercoag State" (ICD-9-CM 289.81) may map to any of five
 ICD-10-CM indications (Activated protein C resistance, Antiphospholipid
 syndrome, Lupus anticoagulant syndrome, Other primary thrombophilia, or
 Prothrombin gene mutation), and so the list is slightly more specific.
 The remaining indications mapped more easily into ICD-10-CM in one-to-one
 fashion.
  
 This patch includes both client- and server-side components, as detailed 
 below. The client-side changes involve making the application "ICD 
 version-aware." That is, based on the date of service, the user 
 will only be able to select diagnoses from the active ICD version
 (ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM) when they specify the indications for care. The
 client was also enhanced to use the same Lexicon Search dialog provided in
 the CPRS Encounter Form, should the user choose 'Other' when selecting the
 indications for care. Here again, only the appropriate ICD version will be
 presented, based on the date of service.
  
  
 ROUTINE:
 ========
    ORAM
    - Modified the PATIENT subroutine to correct a problem with the visit 
      matching algorithm that was observed for new Anticoagulation
      patients. If a patient who was not yet enrolled in the
      Anticoagulation flowsheet database had a visit scheduled for one of
      the Anticoagulation Clinic locations within the look-up interval,
      that visit was not being identified.
  
    ORAM1
    - Modified the ACDATA subroutine to handle selection of SNOMED CT 
      concepts with multiple mapped ICD-9-CM diagnoses (e.g., Transient 
      cerebral ischemia due to atrial fibrillation (SNOMED CT 426814001) =
      427.31/435.9).
  
    ORAM2
    - Modified the RPT subroutine to assure that the Anticoagulation 
      Report on the CPRS Reports tab displays indications in a manner 
      consistent with the rest of AMT.
  
    ORAMSET
    - Modified the GET & INDICS subroutines to accept Visit Date as an 
      argument, and return the appropriate Parameter values, given the
      ICD-10-CM Implementation date.
    - Introduced a new function $$GETCMPDT(CODESYS) that returns a compare 
      date for the Coding System of interest, to be used in screening
      active codes during parameter set-up.
  
    ORAMX
    - Modified the PCESET subroutine to handle the case where a SNOMED CT 
      concept is selected for the indication which has multiple mapped
      ICD-9-CM targets, and to allow an automatic secondary indication.
    - Split routine, moving the WRAP function to ORAMX1, to comply with
      the SACC routine size limit.
  
    ORAMX1
    - Moved the WRAP function from ORAMX, and the RPT subroutine from
      ORAM2 in order to keep those routines within the SACC size limit.
    - Introduced a new function GETVSIT, which will assure that the
      CPRS Report for AMT uses includes all information stored in PCE
      for the Encounter generated for most recent flowsheet entry,
      including any diagnoses that were added via the CPRS Encounter
      form or any other data source.
  
    ORY391
    - Post-install routine, which creates the package-level default values
      for the ORAM I10 INDICATIONS FOR CARE parameter.
  
   
 PARAMETER DEFINITION:
 =====================
    ORAM AUTO PRIMARY INDICATION
    This parameter has been used by the Anticoagulation Management Tool 
    (AMT) v1 to allow the facility to specify an Automatic Primary
    Indication for Care (as ICD-9- CM) for each clinic using the software.
    The current patch modifies the VALUE SCREEN CODE to assure the
    selection of an active ICD-9-CM code prior to ICD-10-CM implementation.
    
    
    ORAM AUTO SECONDARY INDICATION
    This is an Indication for care which will automatically be filed as the
    first Secondary Indication for each visit to the applicable Clinic.
    (e.g., if all visits to a non-licensed provider should be filed with 
    V58.83 ENCTR THERAP DRUG MONITOR as the first secondary indication, you
    can specify that with this parameter, and the user will still be able
    to select additional secondary indication(s) from the list).
    
    
    ORAM I10 AUTO PRIM INDICATION
    This parameter will be used by AMT going forward to allow the facility 
    to specify an Automatic Primary Indication for Care (as ICD-9-CM) for
    each clinic using the software. The current patch includes VALUE SCREEN
    CODE to assure the selection of an active ICD-10-CM code following
    ICD-10-CM implementation.
    
    
    ORAM I10 AUTO SEC INDICATION
    This is an Indication for care which will automatically be filed as the
    first Secondary Indication for each visit to the applicable Clinic.
    (e.g., if all visits to a non-licensed provider should be filed with 
    Z51.81 Encounter for therapeutic drug level monitoring as the first
    secondary indication, you can specify that with this parameter, and the
    user will still be able to select additional secondary indication(s) 
    from the list).
    
    
    ORAM INDICATIONS FOR CARE
    This parameter has been used by AMT v1 to provide a server-side 
    mechanism to specify a list of Additional Indications for Care (as
    ICD-9-CM). The current patch modifies the VALUE SCREEN CODE to assure
    the selection of active ICD-9-CM codes prior to ICD-10-CM
    implementation.
    
    
    ORAM I10 INDICATIONS FOR CARE
    This parameter will be used by AMT going forward to provide a 
    server-side mechanism to specify a list of Additional Indications for
    Care (as ICD-10-CM). The current patch includes VALUE SCREEN CODE to
    assure the selection of active ICD-10-CM codes following ICD-10-CM
    implementation.
  
  
  
 PARAMETER TEMPLATE:
 ===================
    ORAM CLINIC PARAMETERS
    This parameter template is modified to allow the user to specify the 
    value of the new ORAM I10 AUTO PRIM INDICATION for each clinic
    configured to use AMT.
  
    ORAM SITE PARAMETERS
    This parameter template is modified to remove the DSS UNIT and DSS ID
    parameters, which have never been used by AMT and have caused
    significant confusion.
  
  
  
 REMOTE PROCEDURE:
 =================
    ORAM1 ACDATA
    Modified the RPC to accept Date of Service as a parameter.
  
    ORAMSET GET
    Introduced a new parameter to allow the client to pass Visit Date/time 
    in internal VA FileMan format and return a Boolean flag indicating
    whether ICD-10-CM is active as the 11th piece of the 2-node of the
    result array.

 POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===============================
 After successful installation of the OR*3.0*391, IT staff should confer 
 with local CACs and AMT users to:
  
 1. Set the appropriate values for the Automatic Primary and Secondary
    Indications for Care to be used in each Anticoagulation Clinic. To
    receive proper workload credit, these should be set as follows:
    
    Auto Primary Indic for Care (ICD-9-CM)            V58.83
    Auto Secondary Indic for Care (ICD-9-CM)          V58.61
    Auto Primary Indic for Care (ICD-10-CM)           Z51.81
    Auto Secondary Ind for Care (ICD-10-CM)           Z79.01
  
    This can be done using the ORAM ANTICOAGULATION CLINIC PARAMETERS
    VistA option, under the ORAM ANTICOAGULATION SETUP menu.
  
 2. Deploy the new executable AntiCoagulate.exe and the corresponding
    help file, replacing the prior version, either on a network drive,
    or to each of the workstations accessed by the AMT users at your
    facility, as performance and ease of maintenance may require.
