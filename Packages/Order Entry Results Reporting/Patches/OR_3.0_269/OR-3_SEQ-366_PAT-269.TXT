Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Medication Order Check Healthcare Application
 (MOCHA) Enhancements 2 group of patches. A host file was created to 
 simplify installation at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities. 
 The host file MOCHA_ENH_2_GMRA_OR_PSJ_PSO.KID contains: PSJ*5*281, 
 PSO*7*411, OR*3*269 and GMRA*4*46. Additionally there is the stand alone 
 patch PSS*1*175 which must be installed before the combined build.
  
 Important: Recently released patch GMRA*4*48 contains an Allergy 
            Assessment Clean Up utility tool that produces a report that
            identifies discrepancies between the ADVERSE REACTION
            ASSESSMENT file (#120.86) and the PATIENT ALLERGIES file
            (#120.8). It is imperative that GMRA*4*48 be installed prior to
            the installation of OR*3*269 and its associated patches, and
            that all data discrepancies identified by GMRA*4*48 have been
            corrected. If not, then installing OR*3*269 and its associated
            patches may result in drug allergy order checks not displaying
            in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and pharmacy
            during the medication order entry processes.
  
 The following functionality changes are introduced in this patch: 
 1. This patch will enable the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) 
    to display the sign/symptom and the severity of an adverse reaction to
    a medication in its ALLERGY-DRUG INTERACTION order check messages.  It
    will also update the Remote Data Interoperability (RDI) component
    within CPRS to retrieve the sign/symptom, severity, and
    observed/historical data values from the Health Data Repository (HDR)
    for adverse reactions.
  
 2. During testing of an unrelated patch, it was discovered that order 
    checks performed during the AudioCare renewal process were stored
    in the ORDER CHECK INSTANCES (#100.05) file using the user who
    processed the refills, rather than the proxy user. Since the routine
    required to correct this issue is already included in this patch, 
    the correction was added to this patch.

 20100825 Drug-Allergy Order Check Enhancements and Improved Detail
          The following features are introduced by this patch:
          1. Add signs/symptoms and severity data to the drug-allergy 
             order check message.
          2. Replace the site designation (local/remote) with the name of 
             the site that documented the allergy and the date and time of
             when the documentation was entered.
          3. Populate the DRUG ALLERGIES field (#17) in the ORDER CHECK 
             INSTANCES file (#100.05) for drug-allergy order checks.
  
 20080334 CCDSS (CPRS) PSI mandated work 2009
 A Clinical decision Support System is being requested to further enhance 
 drug order checking to improve patient care and reduce costs. This request
 is to address work mandated as determined by Patient Safety Incident (PSI)
 evaluation.
  
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs)
 -----------------------------
 PSPO 2069
 When a provider is shown an adverse reaction order check message, the 
 provider has to cancel the order and then navigate to the coversheet to 
 review both the severity and the signs and symptoms of the reaction. This 
 patch addresses this issue by including the reaction's severity and its 
 signs and symptoms in the order check message. For example, Previous 
 MODERATE adverse reaction to IODINE resulted in VOMITTING (ANN ARBOR VAMC 
 entered on 01/14/2013@14:27).
  
 PSPO 2099
 When a provider is shown an adverse reaction order check message with 
 (LOCAL) at the end of the message, providers have misinterpreted this to 
 mean the patient experienced a localized reaction (such as a rash) 
 instead of the fact that the reaction was documented locally. This patch 
 addresses this issue by replacing the site designation (local/remote) 
 with the name of the site that documented the allergy and the date and 
 time of when the documentation was entered. For example, (ANN ARBOR VAMC 
 entered on 01/14/2013@14:27).
  
 PSPO 457/2072
 The wrong reactant is displayed in the adverse reaction order check 
 message. The ordered drug is displayed as the causative agent. See 
 associated remedy tickets 130757, 173383 and 510151 for resolution. 
  
 PSPO 281
 The adverse reaction order check message displays the ordered drug 
 instead of the causative agent in the adverse reaction order check 
 message. See associated remedy tickets 130757 and 536052.
  
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 1. HD130757 1 Wrong reactant displayed in allergy check pop-up window
    HD173383 pt with sulfa allergy received HCTZ
    HD510151 1 Misleading adverse reaction if order for Furosemide and pt 
             has allergy to Sulfa Drugs
  
 Problem:
 -------

 message. The ordered drug is displayed as the causative agent.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The adverse reaction order check message is modified to correctly display 
 the causative agent from the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8).
  
 2. HD536052 Ofloxacin allergy entry does not prompt for Order checks
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The adverse reaction order check message displays the ordered drug 
 instead of the causative agent in the adverse reaction order check 
 message.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The adverse reaction order check message is modified to correctly display 
 the causative agent from the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8).
  
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 VA Maryland Health Care System
 Sioux Falls VA Health Care System
 Orlando VA Medical Center 
  
  
 Documentation Retrieval Instructions
 ------------------------------------ 
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve the files from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directory on download.vista.domain.ext using secure file transfer protocol
 (SFTP). This transmits the files from the first available SFTP server.
 Sites may also elect to retrieve the files directly from a specific server
 as follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.domain.ext
  Hines          ftp.domain.ext
  Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at: http://www4.domain.ext/vdl/

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The post installation routine will execute the following tasks:
   1.  Add a REMOTE DATA UNAVAILABLE entry to the ORDER CHECKS file 
       (#100.8).
   2.  Update the Allergy-Contrast Media Interactions order check in the
       CPRS Expert System to use the new allergy order check application 
       programming interface (API).
   3.  Convert existing data within the ORDER CHECK INSTANCES file 
       (#100.05) to conform with the new data dictionary.
  
 After the patch is successfully installed, KIDS will automatically delete 
 the main post-install routine ORY269.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 strongly recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours when 
 CPRS usage is at a minimum, particularly medication activities and 
 entering or editing adverse reaction data to minimize potential 
 disruption to users. The amount of time needed to complete the 
 installation is dependent upon the number of entries in the ORDER CHECK 
 INSTANCES (#100.05) file that need conversion and could range from 5 to 
 30 minutes.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 Refer to the MOCHA Enhancements 2 Installation Guide for installation 
 instructions.
