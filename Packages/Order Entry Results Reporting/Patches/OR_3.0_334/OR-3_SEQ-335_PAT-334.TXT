 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000584451 - Increase in Auto Un-Flag activity for Outpatient 
                      Medication Orders
  
    Patient Safety Issue: PSPO #2176
  
    Problem:
    ========
    Through testing at the site, it was determined that the increase in 
    auto unflagged orders was due to the ORPF AUTO UNFLAG parameter setting
    of YES. A typical scenario went something like this: 
  
    1. Pharmacist flags a medication order to a provider via Veterans 
       Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
       Outpatient Pharmacy or Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
       (here, VistA Outpatient Pharmacy). For example, the provider flagged
       is the ordering provider and the flag is asking a question about a
       dose or recommending a different medication.
    2. Provider who was flagged in step 1 receives a CPRS notification for 
       the flagged order. 
    3. Provider processes the notification in CPRS. The action of 
       processing automatically unflags the order for him/her and other 
       recipients of the order flag. 
    4. Once the order is unflagged, the pharmacist from step 1 notices the 
       order is auto unflagged with the system-generated (automatic) 
       comment of "Auto-Unflagged". 
  
    The increase in auto-unflagging of orders with the ORPF AUTO UNFLAG 
    parameter set to YES is leading to the patient safety issue that 
    flagged concerns are not being addressed.
       
    Resolution:
    ===========
    The ORPF AUTO UNFLAG parameter will be set to NO and editing will be
    disabled.
