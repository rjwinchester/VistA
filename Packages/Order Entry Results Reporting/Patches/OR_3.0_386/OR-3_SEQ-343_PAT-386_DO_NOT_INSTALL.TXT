HEADS UP OR*3*386- Do NOT Install -ENTER in ERROR
 
VistA patch OR*3*386 has been entered in error.  If you have not 
installed this patch, no further action is needed.
 
If you have installed this patch (see list of sites that have installed 
as of 9/5/2014 included in this message), restore the routines from your 
backup.  
If you did not keep a backup, enter a REMEDY ticket to the OE/RR package 
and a specialist will contact you.
 
Four sites have reported  the following issue:
1. Providers have reported receiving notifications to sign expired 
orders.  It was determined that these notifications were associated with 
pharmacy orders that had been renewed.  The process of renewing the order 
functions properly, but when the renewed order is processed in the 
pharmacy software, sometimes an expired order with an unsigned status is 
generated, which generates an alert for the provider.
 
A follow-up patch will be created to address the issue(s) identified in 
OR*3*386.  The estimate date of release and patch name designation is to 
be determined.
