 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 1. INC000000070921 - LEB-0804-20731 Day of week schedule displays 
                      differently on meds tab
  
    Problem:
    ========
    The problem occurs when a user uses option [PSJ OE] to edit the 
    administration time on a verified unit dose medication that has a "Day
    of the week" schedule. The schedule gets updated automatically in
    Inpatient Pharmacy, but does not get updated on the Computerized 
    Patient Record System (CPRS) order.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    CPRS will now update the order when there is a schedule change.
   
    Routine ORMPS2 has been modified to check the Health Level 7 (HL7)
    message against the current "SCHEDULE" response. If they do not match,
    the logic is redirected to RO^ORMPS (the logic that updates the order
    and creates a new action).
  
  
 2. INC000000939179 - QO allows regular diet to be ordered with another
                      diet on edit
  
    Problem:
    ========
    If a user edits an existing diet Quick Order using option [ORCM
    QUICK ORDERS], the system allows a regular diet to be ordered with
    another diet.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    The validation logic has been changed to not allow regular diet orders
    to be ordered with other diets.
  
    Routine ORCDFH1 has been modified to set the TOTAL variable properly on
    an edit. ORCDFH1 has also been modified to check if the current diet is
    regular, and if so, to not allow other diets to be ordered with it.
    
    Created post-install routine ORY386 to identify existing Quick Orders 
    that have both a regular diet and another diet. This routine will send
    a mailman message to the user letting them know that the Quick Order
    needs to be manually corrected. The format of the message is as 
    follows: 
  
    Subj: OR*3.0*386 install routine has completed  [#149762]
          03/19/14@15:10 5 lines
    From: ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING PACKAGE  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  
          *New*
          ---------------------------------------------------------------
  
    The following Diet Quick Orders have both a Regular/NPO and another 
    diet. They must be manually edited.
  
    (1st quick order here)   IEN - (internal entry# here)
    (2nd quick order here)   IEN - (internal entry# here)
    (And so on...)
  
    <OR if no diet Quick Orders are found with both a Regular and 
    another diet>
    "None Found"
  
    ***Note: The user may manually edit any existing diet Quick Orders 
    identified by this message that contain both a Regular/NPO diet and 
    another diet using option [ORCM QUICK ORDERS]. 
  
 3. INC000000960066 - Deleting a diet from a Quick order causes CPRS error
  
    Problem:
    ========
    When a user edits an existing diet Quick Order using option [ORCM   
    QUICK ORDERS], if the user removes a diet without replacing with
    another diet, an error occurs when trying to sign the order in CPRS.
    The code is saving the instances of each diet with non-sequential
    instance numbers.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    The code that saves the order dialog has been changed to reorganize the
    instances if one gets deleted.
  
    Routine ORCMEDT0 has been modified to use a newly created ICNT
    (instance count) variable instead of the INST (previous instance
    number) variable.
  
    A post-install routine ORY386 has been created to clean up existing
    Quick Orders with instances that are out of order. This routine will
    send a mailman message to the user that runs the install stating which
    Quick Orders (if any) were updated. The format of the message is as
    follows:
  
    Subj: OR*3.0*386 install routine has completed  [#149762]
          03/19/14@15:10 5 lines
    From: ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING PACKAGE  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  
          *New*
          ---------------------------------------------------------------
  
    OR*3.0*386 install routine has completed
    The instances for the following Quick Orders have been changed
  
    (1st Quick Order here)   IEN - (internal entry# here)
    (2nd Quick Order here)   IEN - (internal entry# here)
    (And so on...)
  
    <Or if no out of order instances are found> 
    "No changes"
