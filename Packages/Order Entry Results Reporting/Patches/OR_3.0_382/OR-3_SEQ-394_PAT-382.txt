Subject: OR MOCHA 2.1 CHANGES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 OR*3*382 is part of the MOCHA v2.1b COMBINED BUILD. This patch will 
 address the following issues:
  
   Corrects an issue with the Application Programming Interface (API) that 
 searches through quick orders for specific orderable items. For Infusion 
 orders, there is a possibility of having multiple orderable items 
 associated with an order. If the name of the Pharmacy Orderable Item was 
 edited for an IV Additive that was contained in a quick order, a 
 notification via MailMan message was not sent to the G. OR CACS mail 
 group and the person that edited the IV Additive Pharmacy Orderable Item. 
 The notification was only sent when the IV Solution Pharmacy Orderable 
 Item was edited. A notification via MailMan message will now be sent if 
 any of the Pharmacy Orderable Item names are edited within a quick order 
 with multiple orderable items. 
  
   CPRS will now display dosing messages in the same order as they are 
 displayed through pharmacy backdoor options
  
   CPRS will group together and display all dosing warnings requiring an 
 override reason by drug.
  
   CPRS
 will group together and display all informational dosing messages by
 drug
  
   CPRS will no longer prompt for an override reason for dosing 
 informational messages. An override reason will only be prompted for high 
 dose warnings.
