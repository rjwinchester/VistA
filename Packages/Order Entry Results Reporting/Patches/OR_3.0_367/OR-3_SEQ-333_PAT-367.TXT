Subject: CHILD EVENT FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues in the CPRS package:
  
 1) CPRS is not properly removing redundant dialogs when child events are 
    used
 2) Child events are not able to be created if there are pending patient 
    events

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1) INC000000143762 - Delayed orders duplicate prompt for admit order
   
 Problem:
 --------
 The problem occurs when the user uses a child event to write delayed 
 orders. If the default dialog used is also an item in the order set, CPRS 
 will display the dialog twice. This happens because a child event doesn't 
 have a default dialog. It inherits it from the parent.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changed the remote procedure call that returns the default dialog, it 
 will now return the parent default dialog for child events.
  
 Routine OREVNTX1 (DFTDLG tag) has been modified to change the variable 
 EVTID to the internal entry number of the parent event, if one exists
  
  
 2) INC000000508634 - <UNDEFINED>LAPSED+7^OREVNTX
   
 Problem:
 --------
 The problem occurs when the user tries to create a child event. If there 
 are any pending patient events for the parent event, the user is not 
 allowed to add a child event. The user should get the following error 
 message displayed on the screen:
  
 "You may not make XXXXXX a parent
 at this time because there are unprocessed delayed orders assigned to it."
  
 Currently, instead of the error message, a hard 
 <UNDEFINED>LAPSED+7^OREVNTX error will occur. This occurs because the 
 code is allowing a ")" at the end of the internal entry number of the 
 event.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the code to force the internal entry number to be numeric.
  
 Routine OREV4 (PARENTOK tag) has been modified to have a "+" in front of 
 the variable PIEN
