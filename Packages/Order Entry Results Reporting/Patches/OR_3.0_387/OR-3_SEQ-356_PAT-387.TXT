Subject: PCMM WEB TEAM DISPLAY ENHANCEMENTS TO CPRS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch addresses changes to the code behind two CPRS RPCs required to 
 support the release and use of Patient-Centered Management Module (PCMM)
 Web. It is released in conjunction with SD*5.3*603.
  
 This patch is a part of a phased, coordinated process for deploying PCMM 
 Web. The VistA software for this patch and the companion SD*5.3*603 
 patch is released as two KIDS host files. They may be downloaded from a 
 secured ftp site as directed by the PCMM Web Implementation Team.
  
 ***********************************************************************
 DO NOT INSTALL THIS PATCH ON A PRODUCTION SYSTEM UNTIL NOTIFIED BY 
 THE PCMM WEB IMPLEMENTATION MANAGER.
 CPRS WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY IF THIS PATCH IS INSTALLED PREMATURELY.
 ***********************************************************************
  
 If the ORWPT1 PRCARE RPC is called by CPRS, the content of the first
 line of the PCMM Header Button is determined and formatted by PCMM Web,
 and stored in the Outpatient Profile File (404.41). The RPC code has
 been modified to retrieve the data from there. If the RPC is not 
 called by CPRS, the data format remains as it was. The Mental Health line
 in the header was modified to include the MH Team name.  
 Associated routine: ORWPT1
 Associated ICRs
    6042 - SCMC PCMM/R GET PRIMARY CARE SUMMARY
    5972 - ORWPT1 PRCARE
  
 If the ORWPT1 PCDETAIL RPC is called by CPRS, the contents of the Primary
 Care Detail Window is retrieved from PCMM Web by a web service, formatted,
 returned to CPRS, and displayed in the window. If the RPC is not called
 by CPRS, the data format remains as it was.
