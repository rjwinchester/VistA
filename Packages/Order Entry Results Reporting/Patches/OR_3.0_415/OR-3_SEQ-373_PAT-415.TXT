Subject: FLG ORDER BULLETIN CHECKBOX,CONSULT STOP DATE INCORRECT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues in the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS 
 REPORTING package:
  
 1) The Flagged Orders bulletins are not being sent when the Send Flagged
    Orders Bulletin checkbox is checked in the CPRS GUI.
  
 2) When a consult is cancelled and resubmitted, the value in the Stop 
    date/time field of the cancelled consult is copied to the new consult 
    instead of being cleared.

 TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) I9835075FY16 - The Mailman bulletins for flagged orders are not being
                   generated
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Mailman bulletins for flagged orders are not being generated when a 
 user selects the checkbox labeled - Send me a Mailman bulletin for 
 flagged orders - in the Notifications tab of Options window in the CPRS
 GUI Tools menu.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The API SAVENOTO^ORWTPR is referencing the incorrect piece of the INFO 
 variable when assigning the FLAG variable which is used to set the value 
 of the ORB FLAGGED ORDERS BULLETIN parameter. To resolve this issue, the 
 following code changes were applied:
  
    From:  S FLAG=$P(INFO,U,3)
      To:  S FLAG=$P(INFO,U,2)
  
 2) I9836179FY16 - Stop date/time does not clear when resubmitting a 
                   cancelled consult                   
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a consult is cancelled and resubmitted, the value in the Stop 
 date/time field of the cancelled consult is copied to the new consult 
 instead of being cleared. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine ORMGMRC was modified for resubmitted consults to clear both 
 the stop date field in the order file and also the associated cross 
 reference entry "AE" that contains the stop date.
