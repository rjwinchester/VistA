  - Routine

Description:
============

 1. Modified Date does not appear in the Problem List Clinical Reports
    within CPRS V29. CQ 21708, HD 926500
  
 2. The Pharmacy Re-engineering team reported an issue with the 
 Application Programming Interface (API) that is used to check for the 
 presence of a specific orderable item within quick orders. The text of 
 the message referred to them as Lab orderable items, rather than Pharmacy 
 orderable items. This patch corrects this problem. CQ 21451
  
 3. This patch will remove all components of the National Utility that
 was delivered in Test patch OR*3*378  which was never nationally released.
 Components of the National Utility included routines ORUTLA1, ORUTLA2,
 ORUTLA3, menu(s) ORE CAC MGR and ORE ORDER INSTRUCTIONS and Parameters
 ORE CLEAN UP UTIL LAST RUN DT and ORE CLEAN UP UTIL START DATE.
 This will only affect sites that were Test sites for patch OR*3*378.
  
 4. There are certain scenarios where medications with only Local Possible
 Dosages (LPD) were appending the drug name to the dosage when performing 
 Dosing Order Checks and when sending the order to backdoor pharmacy.  The
 presence of this extra data would cause the Dosing order checks to fail.
 This patch removes the drug name from the dosage when performing the 
 Dosing checks and when sending the order to backdoor pharmacy.
  
 Example: Drug name with a dosage string like " 1 TABLET CAFFEINE 
    100/ERGOTAMINE 1MG TAB" order created in CPRS and LPD dose exceeds
    the single dose limit did not result in a Dosing order check.
  
 5. When performing the dose check on an order with a local possible 
 dosage, the OR GTX INSTRUCTIONS dialog response is sent to the Pharmacy 
 dosing API.  In certain instances, the value for this dialog response is 
 not acceptable as a dose string and the dosing order check is not 
 performed. An Drug name example of this would be similar to the other
 local possible dose issue.
  
 6. Error IV+7^ORDSGCHK was happening due to orders placed by the Class 
 III software VISTA CHEMOTHERAPY MANAGER.  This patch makes a defensive 
 change to prevent this error.  Remedy Ticket 1034188
  
 7. The Quick Order Search API needs to be updated to use the DISPLAY 
 GROUP to identify a quick order, rather than PACKAGE. CQ 22166.
