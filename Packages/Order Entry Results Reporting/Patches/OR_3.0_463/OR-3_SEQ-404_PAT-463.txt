 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. I9882519FY16 - Entry of a new outside Hct is not correctly reflected 
                   in the progress note created.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When entering PCE information for a progress note, if an HCT is entered 
 and the temporary save button is selected, when going back into the 
 Anticoagulation Management Tool (AMT) that HCT that was entered is not 
 pulled back for the note. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Updated the routine ORAM1 to correctly pull back the HCT that was being 
 stored. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) code was updated to place the 
 returned data into the text box. 
  
                       
 2. I18063927FY18 - Anti-coag tool doesn't always close when you 'complete'
                    the session.
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
 When entering data while using the anticoagulation management tool, when 
 you are on the "exit" tab and click the button to complete the visit, the 
 application should close.  Sporadically however, it does not close, the 
 end user has to manually close or allow the tool to time out.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 There was a check being made by mistake in the AMT GUI for consults 
 associated to the patient selected in AMT. There were no messages
 indicating why the application was not closing. The check has been
 removed, and the AMT application closes as expected.
  
  
 3. I16081772FY17 - NFL-AMT site issues 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When pharmacists are using AMT and want to file data in Patient Care 
 Encounter (PCE) for the appointment, when the pharmacists pick the
 'initial office' visit, it is linking erroneously to the PHONE location.
 The link should be to the VISIT location defined in the parameters.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The AMT GUI application was exercising two different pieces of code for 
 selecting which AMT Clinic Phone parameter to store in the progress 
 note. The erroneous code has been removed.  
  
  
 4. I18063719FY18 - Problem with entering notes for Anti-Coag
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When entering a note using the AMT (on the exit tab) and 
 complete/sign the note, if you select the progress note button again as 
 though you're going to create another note, you get an exception error 
 pop up box indicating that ". is not a valid integer value".
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The broker call that returns consult results was assumed to only return 
 one value when it is possible for two values to be returned. The GUI 
 application was updated to accept more than one return value.

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 ---------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
