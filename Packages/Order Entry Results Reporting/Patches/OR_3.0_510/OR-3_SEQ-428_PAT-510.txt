Description:
============

 The patch addresses two (2) issues:
  
 1. Lab order checking for order frequency does not occur for future 
    collection dates.
  
 2. Lab order checking for duplicate orders does not occur for future 
    collection dates.

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
  
 1. INC5439465 - Lab Frequency Order Checks
  
    Problem:
    --------
    
    Order checking for the "maximum frequency" that a test should be
    ordered is checking against the date/time the order is placed.  The
    collection date/time should be checked instead since orders may be
    placed for future collection dates.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
  
    1. Modify routine ORKLR2 to perform maximum frequency order checks
       against the collection date/time of Lab orders.
    2. Clarify the "Help Prompt" and "Description" fields for the MAX. 
       ORDER FREQ. (#4) and SINGLE DAY MAX ORDER FREQ (#4.5) fields of the 
       COLLECTION SAMPLE SUB-FIELD (#60.03) sub-file of the LABORATORY TEST
       (#60) file.
    3. Add further explanations to the Laboratory Planning Implementation
       Guide (PIG) Version 5.2 pertaining to order check functionality on
       frequency-related fields. 
    4. Add clarification to the CPRS Setup Guide that order checks may 
       occur for "frequency" as defined in the LABORATORY TEST (#60) file
       in addition to duplicate order checks.

           DESCRIPTION:      Use this field to control how often a test may
                             be ordered within a certain time period (# of
                             days). The entry will then force the system to
                             remind the ordering person that the order they
                             are placing for this test exceeds the maximum
                             order frequency.  If you enter 3, the test may
                             only be ordered once every three days.

           HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the timeframe in number of days (between

                             be collected only once.
           DESCRIPTION:      Use this field to control how often a test may
                             be ordered to be collected within a certain
                             time period (# of days). If you enter "3", the
                             test should only be ordered to be collected
                             once every three days. The entry will then 
                             force CPRS to remind the ordering person that
                             the order being placed for this test exceeds
                             the maximum order frequency.

           HELP-PROMPT:      Enter the maximum number of times (between 1
                             and 50) that a test should be ordered to be
                             collected on a single day. 
           DESCRIPTION:      If this test should not be ordered to be
                             collected more than a certain number of times
                             per day, enter a number (between 1 and 50)
                             specifying the maximum frequency per day. The 
                             entry will then cause CPRS to remind the
                             ordering person that the order being placed
                             for this test exceeds the "single day maximum
                             frequency" for the specified collection date.
  
 2. INC5439361 - Lab Duplicate Order Checks
  
    Problem:
    -------
  
    Order checking for "duplicate orders" is checking against the date/time
    the order is placed.  The collection date/time should be checked
    instead since orders may be placed for future collection dates.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
  
    Modify routine ORKLR to perform duplicate order checks against the 
    collection date/time of Lab orders.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can be
 installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid
 problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
 1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This option
    will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
 2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your system.
    You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
 3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS), select
    the 'Installation' menu.
  
 4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
    all routines have the correct checksums.
     
 5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
    options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
    To preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch prior to
    installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' option at
    this time. You may also compare the routines in your production account
    to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare a Transport Global
    to Current System' option.
  
 6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' Menu and
    select the package 'OR*3.0*510'.
  
    If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//,
    choose 'NO'.
  
    If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
    Protocols? YES//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
  
 1. Compare the checksum of the routines ORKLR and ORKLR2 to the "After"
    checksums listed in the patch description.
  
 2. Compare the data dictionary changes to the "Data Dictionaries After" 
    section of this patch description.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
  
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.  No
 data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no rollback
 strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum matches
 the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
  
 It should not be necessary to back out the Data Dictionary changes for 
 this patch since only text was added to clarify intended functionality.  
 The functionality itself was not modified by the Data Dictionary changes.
