Subject: LABS WITH NEITHER TYPE ARE ORDERABLE/CRCL DOES NOT CALCULATE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch corrects 3 issues within the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING 
 package:
  
 1. Orderable Items with a value in the TYPE (#60.7) field of Neither 
    appear as an available lab test when ordering in CPRS [Computerized
    Patient Record System].
  
 2. When the last creatinine lab has a "canc" result then the CrCL 
    [Creatinine Clearance] calculation will skip all results with the same
    specimen and go on to look at lab results for other specimens.
  
 3. When a weight or height entry for the patient's vitals is marked as
    Pass, Unavailable or Refused the CrCL value for the patient disappears
    even though there is a previous valid entry.
  
  
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 =============================
 PSPO 3072: VistA selects creatinine results from 1/7/1992 for creatinine 
            clearance (CrCL) calculation on a patient with more recent labs
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
 1. R5652139FY15 - BL: File 60 tests set to "Output" and "Neither" still
                   appear in the "All Other Labs" ordering list in CPRS
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Any entry in the ORDERABLE ITEMS (#101.43) file with a value in the
    TYPE (#60.7) field of Neither appear as an available lab test when
    ordering in CPRS. This only happens when there is a manual change to
    the SET (#.01) field in the SET MEMBERSHIP subfile (#9).
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The Data Dictionary entry for the SET (#.01) field was modified to 
    control for Type being set to Neither when creating index values.
  
 2. R7070724FY16 - BL: VistA pulls up creatinine from 01/07/92 labs for
                   creatinine ...
    Duplicate: I18695731FY18
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When the last creatinine lab has a "canc" result then the CrCL
    calculation will skip all results with the same specimen and go on to
    look at lab results for other specimens. This means that the latest
    valid result may be skipped over in favor of very old results or CrCL
    is not calculated.     
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ORQQLR1 will be modified to look for the last valid result in a
    specimen.
  
 3. I9885268FY16 - BL: CrCl not calculated when last enter weight in vitals
                   package is "unavailable"
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a weight or height entry in to the patient's vitals is marked as
    Pass, Unavailable or Refused the CrCL value for the patient disappears
    even though there is a previous valid entry.
      
    Technical:
    ----------
    The API [Application Programmer Interface] defined in IA [Integration
    Agreements] #5770 that returns the last vitals value for CrCL
    lab tests is also used by the cover sheet to display the last value
    entered. The CrCL needs the last valid value while the cover sheet
    needs the last value. Right now the API is returning the last value
    even if it is invalid and there is a valid value previously entered.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ORQQVI will be modified to create separate tags for the IA and
    the cover sheet. The API defined for the IA will know search for the
    latest valid value.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch can be loaded with users in the system but it is recommended 
 that it be installed when user activity is low. Installation time will be
 less than 2 minutes.
  
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch. 
  
  2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
      Installation Menu. From this menu, you may elect to use the 
      following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch
      OR*3.0*414:
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not back
         up any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         (allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
  4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
      choose the patch to install.
  
  5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
      answer NO.
  
  6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Menu Options and
      Protocols? NO//', answer NO.
  
  7.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' respond 0.
  
 Backout/Rollback Strategy:
 ==========================
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch. Since this patch contains both routine
 and data dictionary changes the back-out procedure will have two phases.
  
 Routine back-out:
 -----------------  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksums match
 the pre-patch checksums from the patch description.
  
 Data Dictionary back-out:
 -------------------------
 To modify the input transform code, copy the following and paste at 
 the programmer prompt:
  
 S ORX="Q:$P($G(^ORD(101.43,DA(1),""LR"")),U,7)=""O"""
 S ORX=ORX_"  N NM,IN S NM=$P(^(0),U),IN=$G(^(.1)) S:$L(NM) "
 S ORX=ORX_"^ORD(101.43,""S.""_X,$$UP^XLFSTR(NM),DA(1))=U_NM_U_IN"
 S ^DD(101.439,.01,1,2,1)=ORX
 K ORX
