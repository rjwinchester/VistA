 CA SDM OVERVIEW:
 ================
 I14795124FY17 (RTC 537153)-The eUAP is not working. It is firing
 incorrectly and causing a patient safety issue, incorrectly entering 
 medication orders.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 It is possible to create an inpatient order with the (Display Group) "TO:"
 field set to "INPATIENT MEDICATIONS". "INPATIENT MEDICATIONS" is an older
 Legacy display group that should no longer be used on new orders; instead 
 "UNIT DOSE MEDICATIONS" should be used. Orders created with the 
 "INPATIENT MEDICATIONS" display group will not create outpatient 
 medications when using the "Transfer to Outpatient" action on CPRS but 
 will instead create a new inpatient medication order that gets cancelled 
 upon the discharge event occurring.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch will run a post-install cleanup routine that generates a 
 MailMan message upon installation and the patch will add functionality to 
 monitor for future instances of the incorrect display group being used.
  
 First, the post-install routine ORY461 has been created to clean up 
 existing orders on currently admitted patients that have the display group
 set to INPATIENT MEDICATIONS.
  
 This routine will send a local MailMan message to the user that runs the
 install stating which orders (if any) were updated.
  
 The format of the message is as follows:
  
 Subj: OR*3.0*461 install Post routine has completed  [#254176] 
 06/20/17@12:44
 6 lines
 From: ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING PACKAGE  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  
 *New*
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 OR*3.0*461 Post install routine has completed
 The following order(s) have had their display group changed
 from INPATIENT MEDICATIONS to UNIT DOSE MEDICATIONS
 **INFORMATIONAL ONLY - No action required** :
 (1st order# here)
 (2nd order# here)
 (And so on...)
  
 <OR if no out of order instances are found>
 "None Found"
  
 -------------------------------------------
  
 Additionally, ORWDX and ORWDX1 have been modified to check if the system 
 attempts to save an order using the "INPATIENT MEDICATIONS" display group.
 If so the display group will be switched to "UNIT DOSE MEDICATIONS" and a 
 MailMan message will be generated to FORUM for notification of this 
 attempt. This message is independent of the message generated from the
 post-install routine at installation.  New routine ORUTL5 will send this
 MailMan message to the following mail groups in FORUM:
  
 G.HPS CLIN2@FORUM.DOMAIN.EXT 
  
 G.CLINICAL REMINDERS SUPPORT@FORUM.DOMAIN.EXT
  
 Notes: Your site may be contacted by the Health Product Support (HPS) 
             CLIN 2 team to review any local orders identified by this
             FORUM mail message.
        If your site is using Generic Orders it is possible that an older 
             Generic Order may be identified with the INPATIENT 
             MEDICATIONS display group which is incorrect. These generic
             orders will require updating. CLIN 2 will create an SDM
             Incident to review these generic orders and provide guidance
             on the correction of the display group. 
  
  
 The format of the FORUM message is as follows:
