Associated patches: (v)OR*3*459    <<= must be installed BEFORE `OR*3*451'

Subject: ANTICOAG:REPEATING INR/EARLY APPTS.

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch OR*3.0*451 addresses the following three (3) issues:
  
 1. I17625741FY18 - The show rate calculation skips over visits with an 
 INR that repeats the previous visit's INR.
  
 2. I17662491FY18 - When a patient comes in early - 48 hours before the 
 next draw date - then it is counted as a missed appointment.
  
 3. I18565288FY18 - The show rate calculation comes up as "None" for
 patients who have a callback as their first appointment and an error
 is logged in the error trap.
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Tickets(s) & Overview:
 =============================================
  
 1. I17625741FY18(CA SDM) -  AMT Show Rate Issue #1: Blank INR visit issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The show rate calculation skips over visits with a blank INR or an INR 
 that repeats the previous visit's INR. The idea behind this behavior is
 possibly to skip over multiple following entries in a day. However that
 behavior is not appropriate since it is also affects an entry for a later
 day.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Routine ORAM2 has been modified to no longer skip over repeating INR 
 entries. Instead it will now properly skip over same day entries. Blank
 INR visits will still be skipped over since that is desired behavior.
  
 Routine: ORAM2
  
 2. I17662491FY18(CA SDM) -  AMT Show Rate Issue #2 - 48 hour window
  
 Problem:
 --------
 There is a +/- 48 hour window that the New Draw date is checked against. 
 When a patient is early - if they come in prior to that 48 hour clock -
 then it is considered a missed appointment and will skew the show rate.
 This is not desired behavior since a patient should be able to come in
 early.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 The routine has been changed to only count appointments as late if they 
 are more than 2 days after the next draw date.
  
 Routine: ORAM2
  
 3. I18565288FY18 - NFL: Patch OR*3*459 installed this am. Error 
 <UNDEFINED>SHOWRATE+20^ORAM2 *ORAMRDT showing multiple times in Error 
 Trap since.
 Duplicates: I18593168FY18
             I18592293FY18 
             I18581253FY18
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If the first appointment of a patient was a callback then an error screen
 is displayed when opening the AMT application. The show rate calculation 
 comes up as "None" even if there are other appointments. An error entry 
 <UNDEFINED>SHOWRATE+20^ORAM2 *ORAMRDT is logged in the error trap.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 The routine has been modified to properly initialize the ORAMRDT variable.
  
 Routine: ORAM2

 Patch Installation:
  
 This patch can be loaded with users in the system but it is recommended 
 that it be installed when user activity is low.  Installation time will be
 less than 2 minutes.
  
  1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch 
  
  2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select the
      Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the 
      following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch
      OR*3.0*451:
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not back
         up any other changes such as DDs or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         (allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
  4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
      choose the patch to install.
  
  5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',

 Backout/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routines included
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routines from the backup created.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksums match
 the pre-patch checksums from the patch description.
