Description:
============

 The Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Information and Technology
 requires that applications remain compliant with the Technical Reference
 Model (TRM) regarding the version of tools used for development.
 This patch modernizes the Anticoagulation Management Tool (AMT) 
 Graphical User Interface (GUI), porting it to the latest version of the
 development tools, Delphi to XE10.2, and Windows 10. 
  
 It also addresses an issue with accessing the AMT's online help when
 installed on a network shared drive. Many of the VistA instances are now
 pushing their GUI installations to network share drives, rather than
 installing on individual machines. It was discovered that the online help 
 would not work when the application was installed on the network share 
 drive. This patch corrects this problem.

 Installation/Implementation Guide may be retrieved by using Secure File 
 Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and documentation directly using 
 SFTP from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following OI Field
 Offices:
  
 Hines:  domain.ext

 Patch Installation:
  
 Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------- 
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes
 to install.  
  
 Please refer to the Installation/Implementation Guide for 
 full instructions to install the KIDS, as well as the GUI, help and RAV
 files exported with this update.
  
 1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
 2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
    the Installation menu.
  
 3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options (when
    prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*489).      
  
     a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
     d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
        the components of the KIDS build.

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 Post-installation routine ORAMP489 is provided which updates the new 
 ORAM GUI VERSION parameter with the expected version number for
 AntiCoagulate.exe.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 The ORAMP489 post-install includes a ROLLBACK entry point that
 can be used to reset the ORAM GUI VERSION back to the previous
 value. It can be run manually:
 D ROLLBACK^ORAMP489
  
 No other data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.

Routine Information:
