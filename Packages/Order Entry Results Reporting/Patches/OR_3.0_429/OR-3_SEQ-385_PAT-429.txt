Subject: Problem Selection List Enhancements for CPRS

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch introduces the problem selection list enhancements that are 
 documented in NSR 20160107: Problem List Diagnosis Menu. In order to 
 document a problem within the Problems tab, users must use the Lexicon 
 search to document the problem which often is time consuming and 
 inefficient for common problems. To alleviate this burden, this request 
 seeks to provide a list of commonly used diagnoses in SNOMED CT for a 
 user and/or clinic. A Clinical Application Coordinator (CAC) will have 
 the capability to assign users and/or clinics to any of the problem 
 selection lists through the associating menu options.
  
 The CPRS changes associated with these enhancements include a new Default 
 Problem Selection List Display parameter, ORQQPL SELECTION LIST, which 
 streamlines selection list assignment and management. This parameter 
 determines which problem selection list the user will be shown when 
 adding a new patient problem in CPRS.
  
 A default selection list may be assigned to the following entities and 
 their precedence levels:
  
      1   User          USR    [choose from NEW PERSON]
      2   Location      LOC    [choose from HOSPITAL LOCATION]
      3   Division      DIV    [choose from INSTITUTION]
      4   System        SYS    [XXXX.XXXX.DOMAIN.EXT]
  
 As with all other parameters, an entity at a higher level will take 
 precedence over an entity at a lower level. So if a particular selection 
 list is assigned to a user, the default selection list associated with a 
 selected clinic location will not be displayed to the user. The user's 
 default list will be displayed instead.
  
 A CAC can access and manage the default list settings in several ways: 1) 
 General Parameter Tools menu, 2) Assign/Remove Problem Selection List 
 [GMPL ASSIGN LIST] menu option, or 3) through the Assign List menu action 
 when creating/editing a problem selection list in the List Manager app.
  
 Since the related GMPL*2.0*49 patch will export the VA-NATIONAL PROBLEM 
 SELECTION LIST, this patch will set this as the default selection list at 
 the system and package levels of the parameter.
  
 Additionally, the pre-existing user and clinic list assignments in the 
 New Person and Problem Selection List files respectively will be migrated 
 over and managed under this new parameter. Those lists that contain one 
 or more problems with inactive SNOMED and/or ICD codes will not be 
 migrated and will require a CAC's review. These lists will be displayed 
 to the installer during installation.
