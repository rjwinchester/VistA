Description:
============

 This patch is a follow up to the Computerized Patient Record System 
 (CPRS) Graphical User Interface (GUI) v30.B release.
  
 The following issues are addressed by this patch in addition to the items 
 listed under the Defect Tracking System section:
  
 1. OR*3.0*389 released an addition to the ORDER MENU MANAGEMENT [ORCM
 MGMT] menu. The Create Clinic Order QOs from Inpatient QOs [OR CONV INPT 
 QO TO CLIN ORD QO] option was added to convert clinic order quick orders 
 from existing inpatient quick orders. This new utility included the 
 ability to "copy" or "move" quick orders. The copy action would also try 
 to delete the original quick order if the user wanted to do so.
  
 An issue was discovered in the copy process where the utility was 
 checking for any items pointing to (using) the original quick order, 
 *before* the user was prompted about deleting the original quick order. 
 If any pointers were found, the utility would then issue a message 
 stating: "Cannot delete order dialog - other file entries point to this 
 order dialog!" This creates user confusion, as the user was never 
 actually asked about deleting the quick order.
  
 This issue has been resolved by correcting the logic used during the copy 
 process. When copying quick orders, users will be prompted with, 
 "Do you want to delete the original quick order?" If yes, the utility 
 will then check for any pointers and issue the "cannot delete" message 
 when pointers are found. Jazz 300410
 Example:
      Select one of the following:
  
           1         MOVE
           2         COPY
  
 Enter response: 2  COPY
 NAME: COPY TEST FOR OR*3*423
  
   Quick order copy complete.
  
 Do you want to delete the original quick order? NO// YES
 Cannot delete order dialog - other file entries point to this order 
 dialog!
  
 423 UNIT DOSE DEL ON COPY T1 is pointed to by:
 FILE #    IEN       NAME

 Press any key to continue:
  
 2. Three new reports were added to CPRS on the Labs Tab and Reports Tab
 with the installation of Patch OR*3.0*350 or CPRS Version 30b. Those
 reports are the Lab Overview (Collected Specimens), Pending Lab Orders and
 Lab Orders (All). It has been reported that not all orders are being
 displayed. The problem is that the orders are being pulled from the
 database using the Order Date/Time rather than the Collection Date/Time.
 Since the Order Date/Time can be very different from the actual Collection
 Date/Time, some of the orders appear to be missing from the display
 because the Order Date/Time doesn't fall within the date range selected by
 the user. The fix for this problem is to use the Collection Date/Time
 rather than the Order Date/Time when pulling data from the database.
  
 Another problem affecting the content of these three reports was found
 dealing with the purging of old orders and accessions in the VISTA Lab
 package. The purged orders did not display on the reports because the
 extract routine was pulling from the files that had been purged. This
 has been corrected with this patch and you should now see the orders
 affected by the Lab purge in the reports. Jazz 311865
  
 There was also a problem where Lab orders that had been merged in the lab 
 files were showing up twice on the reports. This was corrected by 
 modifying the extract routine to properly handle merged orders. Jazz 
 311880
  
 These reports that have Lab Test Names longer than 25 characters is
 causing the results display in the Details pane to all run together making
 it difficult to read. This has been corrected so that Test Names longer
 than 25 characters will use the Lab Test Print name instead of the Lab
 Test Name. Jazz 315346, 349857
  
 3. Patch OR*3.0*389 created two new cross references in the ORDERS file 
 (#100) on the DIALOG (100,2) and the ITEM ORDERED (100,7) fields 
 respectively. It was discovered that these new cross references were not 
 being populated for new orders created after the install of OR*3.0*389.
  
 This patch will queue a tasked job to search through ORDERS and add
 any missing "C" and/or "D" cross reference entries. The post-install will
 look up the install date of OR*3.0*389, and use the day before that date
 as the start date to begin searching for missing cross reference entries.
 E.g. OR*3.0*389 installed on April 7, 2016; start date will be April 6,
 2016. This patch also updates the order save process to populate the cross
 references.
  
 If the install date for OR*3.0*389 is not found, the patch will abort and 
 ask the installer to submit a help desk ticket for further assistance. 
 When the cross reference setting process has successfully completed, a 
 MailMan message with the subject of "PATCH OR*3.0*423 ORDER INDEX 
 CORRECTION STATUS" will be sent to the patch installer (DUZ). The text of 
 the message is:
  
   "The file #100 index correction from OR*3.0*423 was successfully
   completed."
  
 If the tasked job is asked to stop before the cross reference setting 
 process has completed, a status message, with the same subject as above, 
 will be sent to the installer. The text of that message is:
  
   "The file #100 index correction in OR*3.0*423 has unexpectedly stopped.
    If you or the system manager did not stop the process, please check the
    error log and file a help desk ticket for assistance.
  
    To requeue the cleanup/conversion process, run RESTART^ORY423 from the
    programmer prompt and when asked for the starting order date, enter
    3150722.1337"
  
 NOTE: The date shown above (3150722.1337) is just an example. If you
 receive the status message indicating the process has unexpectedly
 stopped, use the date listed in your message, not the date shown here in
 this example.
  
 Exactly how long the tasked job will take to run will vary according to 
 the number of orders that have been entered since OR*3.0*389 has been 
 installed. While running, the task itself will appear in TaskMan and 
 other task monitoring options with the following message: 
 "File 100 C/D Index Correction". Jazz 322145
  
 4. As part of the installation of patch OR*3*350 (CPRS v30b), all 
 Outpatient Medication quick orders that were built for orderable items 
 that were considered supply items were converted to the PSO SUPPLY 
 dialog. While this works correctly for providers using the quick orders, 
 if a nurse uses them then issues may occur later (dependent on several 
 other settings). For example, the nurse may not be able to change, copy 
 or renew the orders. Therefore, this patch has a post-install routine 
 that will move these quick orders back to the Outpatient Medication 
 dialog. This is a temporary measure. Once the issues with the PSO SUPPLY 
 dialog are corrected, a new menu option will be created to allow the site 
 to determine when (if) they wish to move their supply quick orders to the 
 PSO SUPPLY dialog. There will be a future patch to correct the PSO SUPPLY 
 dialog issues. Jazz 337290
  
 5. CPRS 30B (OR*3*350) included functionality related to what was IMO but 
 is now Clinic Medications and Infustions.  This included 2 new order 
 dialogs that allow for simplicity of entering these orders.  When using 
 these dialogs the user is shown a message "You are about to enter a 
 Clinic Medication/Infusion order.  Are you sure this is what you want to 
 do?"  During 30B deployment it was determined that if the patient was an 
 outpatient and the current location was a Clinic Setup for Clinic orders, 
 then this message should not display.  This patch makes the change so 
 that it does not display in this scenario.  It also changes it so that in 
 situations where the message does display, that the default action is the 
 "Yes" button so that the user can hit enter to get by it. Jazz 329483
  
 6. When flagging an Orderable Item (OI) for Inpatient Meds, the flagged 
 OI alert would not fire sometimes for items in an IV order. This was due 
 to the fact that IV orders contain multiple Orderable Items.  This patch 
 corrects this in that the alert can fire for any of the OIs in the IV 
 order. Jazz item: 258188, HD: 69339, 70141, 155223, 606492
  
 7. When flagging an Orderable Item (OI) for Inpatient Meds, if an order 
 was placed for that OI as a Clinic Medication/Infusion or an Inpatient 
 med for a patient that is currently an outpatient, then the flagged OI 
 alert would not fire.  With this patch it will now fire correctly in 
 those situations. Jazz item 258189
  
 8. A defect was introduced with OR*3*350 (CPRS 30B) where if the IV 
 ORDER DIALOG in file 101.41 (PSJ OR PAT OE) has the field "ASK FOR 
 ANOTHER ORDER" set to "NO" then when an IV order was placed it would 
 file 2 IV orders that were duplicates.  Although this was found on the IV 
 ORDER DIALOG it also was possible for this to happen on other order types 
 as well.  This issue is fixed now so that in this scenario only a single 
 IV order is placed. Jazz 328611 and 336043
  
 9. When manually typing a Reason for Request (vs. insertion via template)
 the text is not wrapping as you approach the right margin. This issue was
 caused by the CPRS GUI application moving from Delphi 2006 to Delphi XE3.
 The text field used in the Reason for Request was updated to have
 different behavior with respect to scrolling regions and automatically
 wrapping lines of text. The properties of this text field have been 
 updated to restore automatic wrapping of text as the text approaches the
 right margin. Jazz 317140
  
 10. The tab order in the main CPRS application form, fFrame, was 
 inadvertently changed. This change created tab order issues on several of 
 the CPRS Tabs. For example, in CPRS GUI 30a after moving to the Consults 
 Tab, pressing the TAB key once would select the first consult in the list.
 In 30b, the same action would select the patient header bar and require
 multiple presses of the TAB key to move through the header bar and into
 the list of consults. Similar behavior of additional tabbing can be seen
 on other CPRS Tabs. The tab order in fFrame has been restored to its 30a
 state which will generally have the initial press of the TAB key select
 the first item of interest on a given CPRS TAB (the first consult, note,
 report, etc.). Jazz 336244
  
 11. When a user accesses the template editor in CPRS, the template drawer 
 no longer displays correctly nor can the templates be accessed 
 appropriately until the user logs out of CPRS and then logs back in. 
 This issue has been corrected. Jazz 258591
  
 12. Supply quick orders that were created from Outpatient quick orders no 
 longer honored the QO-ONLY field. This patch corrects this issue by 
 adding the ability to move the QO-ONLY restriction to the supply quick 
 order. Jazz 301893
  
 13. A site reported an issue with the new MOVE feature for quick orders. 
 There was no indication that the action was occurring. This patch 
 corrects this problem by adding an additional confirmation prompt after 
 the MOVE action is selected. Jazz 328177
  
 14. Sites utilizing the Server List function from a Citrix server 
 reported that it was no longer functioning. This patch corrects this 
 issue. Jazz 329474
  
 15. The color of the CWAD display in the CPRS Postings box was 
 unintentionally modified in CPRS V30B. This patch corrects this problem 
 by reverting the CWAD color back to the CPRS V30A color. Jazz 329489
  
 16. A site reported a problem with being unable to use personal 
 templates. When selecting a template from the drawer and then 
 right-clicking and selecting edit, the system was not auto-selecting the 
 template. This patch corrects this issue. Jazz 331308
  
 17. When you slected an order set of unit dose medications and the 
 encounter location was set to a clinic set up to allow administration of 
 Inpatient Medication orders, you were prompted to confirm you wanted to 
 enter a clinic medication order. However, if you answered NO, only the 
 first order was ignored. This patch corrects this issue so that the 
 prompt will now show up until you respond with a YES. Jazz 337007

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview
 --------------------------------------------
 1. I5957404FY16  Group Notes package not saving all of Encounter data
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Certain procedure codes (99078, 90853, H0005) that are selected from
 the search results are not saving to PCE correctly when completing a Group
 Notes encounter. As a result these encounters were flagged as incomplete 
 on the ACTION REQUIRED status report. Jazz 258758
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 There is a bug in the ORWPCE4 LEX RPC that incorrectly renders the
 procedure code and returns an empty code in the return results. This has 
 been corrected so that the appropriate procedure codes are returned to 
 Group Notes and saved to PCE correctly.
  
 2. I8043301FY16  PATCH OR*3*389 POST INSTALL ITEMS
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Since the introduction of Earliest Appropriate Date (EAD) in CPRS GUI v28,
 prosthetics quick orders have been stuffed with a default response/value
 for the EAD field when using the quick order editor. This was discovered 
 by a site during their review of the CONSULT/PROCEDURE QOs EARLIEST 
 APPROPRIATE DATE DEFAULT VALUE report generated during the installation of
 OR*3.0*389 which assists in the review of consult quick orders in advance 
 of the change from EAD to Clinically Indicated Date (CID) in CPRS GUI 
 v30.b. Jazz 303682
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When creating/editing quick orders, the EAD/CID prompt is already being 
 filtered out if the consult service is a prosthetics service. Now, the 
 default value for this prompt will also be filtered out when the consult 
 service is a prosthetics service.

 3. Problem:
 The down arrow for the Collection Date/Time field in the diagnostic test
 section of the Blood Bank order dialog on the orders Tab is disappearing
 after a Diagnostic test is selected for Lab Collect. Jazz 329452
  
 Resolution:
 This has been corrected so the down arrow does not disappear.
  
 5. Problem:
 The All Medications Report on the Reports Tab gets an Undefined error when
 the link between CPRS and Pharmacy is missing. Jazz 258774
  
 Resolution:
 The code that creates the ALL MEDICATIONS report has been changed so that
 the missing reference between CPRS and Pharmacy will not cause the report
 to error out.
  
 6. Problem:
 A provider reported that the Pending Lab orders lab info from Patient A 
 appeared on Patient B's lab tab info. This occurred when the provider 
 viewed lab data on the Labs Tab for Patient A and then viewed Patient B's 
 lab data  via a View Alert. Jazz 348917
  
 Resolution:
 This has been resolved by clearing out the previous patients lab data 
 on the screen before showing the current patients information. 
 Other unnecessary information, like date range selection and grid 
 display has been removed from the screen that shows the previous 
 patient's lab results when processing a different patient's lab alert.

 Patch Installation:
 =================== 
 ***Important Note***
 One site has reported a sporadic issue with the date range selection 
 prompts not displaying for some reports, such as the Lab Worksheet. The
 issue only occurred when the OR REPORT DATE SELECT TYPE parameter is set
 to NO or blank.
  
 If this occurs at your site, you can change the OR REPORT DATE SELECT 
 TYPE to YES, which will toggle your display to the radio button view.
  
 Please refer to the CPRS v30c (OR*3*423) Installation Guide: 
 OR_30_423_IG.docx for file names and installation instructions, 
 including how to set the parameter above if you need assistance.
