Description:
============

 This patch will add enhancements to the Inpatient Order Entry routines for
 the National Clozapine Coordination project.  Below is a list of all the 
 applications involved in this project along with their patch numbers:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    MENTAL HEALTH (MH) V. 5.01                          YS*5.01*122
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                     PSO*7*457 
    INPATIENT MEDICATIONS (IP) V. 5.0                   PSJ*5*327
    ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING (OR) V. 3.0           OR*3*427
  
 The patches (YS*5.01*122, PSO*7*457, PSJ*5*327, and OR*3*427) are 
 being released  in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System
 (KIDS) multi-build distribution MENTAL HEALTH NCC PROJECT 5.01.
  
 Abbreviations for terms used in the multi-build patch descriptions 
 include the National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC) located in
 Dallas, Texas; Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC); White Blood Cells (WBC);
 Initial Operating Capability (IOC); and Computerized Patient Record 
 System (CPRS).
  
 The purpose of this software package is to maintain compliance with 
 legislative and federal mandates, as well as to add Clozapine Order
 Checking to the Inpatient Pharmacy application. In addition, this 
 package replaces the weekly roll-up functionality and now transmits 
 data to the National Clozapine server nightly.
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 The ORDER CHECK RULE file (#860.2) and the ORDER CHECK ELEMENT file 
 (#860.3) need to be modified to meet the new FDA Clozapine reporting
 guidelines.  
  
 1. The CLOZAPINE entry in the ORDER CHECK RULE file (#860.2) will be 
    modified to:
    a. Remove the WBC order checks
    b. Modify the ANC order check values to meet new FDA guidelines
 2. Add new entries to the ORDER CHECK ELEMENT file (#860.3)
    a. ELEMENT NAME: CLOZAPINE ANC >= 1.0 & < 1.5
    c. ELEMENT NAME: CLOZAPINE ANC < 1.0
 3. Modify the ^ORALWORD routine to display the appropriate order check
    message based on:
    a. The new ANC (Absolute Neutrophil Count) values
    b. Outpatient
   
      *** Permission to dispense clozapine has been denied based on the
      available lab tests related to the clozapine treatment program. ***
  
      For a National Override to dispense at the patient's normal
      frequency, contact the NCCC.
  
      A local override for an Outpatient can be approved for: (1)
      weather-related conditions, (2) mail order delays of clozapine, 
      or (3) inpatient going on leave.
  
      For an Outpatient Special Conditions Local Override, a written 
      prescription from the provider with documentation to the pharmacist
      is required to dispense a one-time emergency 4-day supply.
  
    c. Inpatient
  
      *** Permission to dispense clozapine has been denied based on 
      the available lab tests related to the clozapine treatment program.
      ***
  
      For a National Override to dispense at the patient's normal
      frequency, contact the NCCC.
  
      A local emergency override for an Inpatient can be approved for:
      IP Order Override with Outside Lab Results.
  
      For a Special Conditions Local Override, a written order
      from the provider with documentation to the pharmacist
      is required to dispense a one-time emergency 4-day supply. 
    
      The provider must record the ANC from another facility including 
      date/time in both the Provider Progress Note and Comment field in
      CPRS.
  
  
    Message will be added and enforce a hard stop on the order.
