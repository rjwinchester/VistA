 1. I10023446FY16 Flagged Orderable Item Notification
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Flagged Orderable Item notifications for expiring orders do not fire 
    for an orderable item that is selected as an additive of an IV order.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
  
    Routine ORB3TIM2 is being modified to review all orderable items listed
    to check against the flagged setting. ORB3SPEC has been modified to 
    generate the recipients for the expiring flagged orderable item 
    notifications.

    Problem:
    -------
    CPRS Technical Manual: GUI version, page 169 under the "Other" section 
    needs additional text for clarification. 
  
    Solution:
    --------
    The manual is being updated to show, page 172: The "other" selection 
    for these items is available for any lab test with the "MI"
    (microbiology) subscript, for all users.  Additionally, for users
    holding the LRLAB key, the "other" selection is available for all
    lab tests, regardless of subscript.
