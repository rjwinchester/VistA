Subject: PRINTING MAH FROM CPRS, PATIENT PROBLEM LIST, TEAM LIST ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues:
 1. BCMA Report Date Range when crossing a month.
 2. The VISTA printer version of the Patient Problem List has a dashed 
    line superimposed over the first header line.
 3. Error attempting to generate an alert set up to go to a Team List when
    there is a bad "AB" cross-reference in the OE/RR LIST file (#100.21).

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1.       R12229988FY17 - BCMA Report Date Range
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When printing a report from the Computerized Patient Record System 
 (CPRS) Reports tab using a user specified date range, and the report date
 range traverses a year or month, then on the printed report the date range
 changes the start date to the MAXIMUM DAYS BACK value specified for the
 option, FILE NAME (file #101.24), from the user entered end range date.
  
 Resolution: 
 -----------
 Routine ORWRPP at tag DEQUE+12 has been modified to use the Fileman date 
 difference function to compute the date difference ($$FMDIFF^XLFDT) the 
 accurate days difference.
  
 2.      I9836117FY16 - Problems Tab: printing issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When printing out the Problem List from the CPRS Problems tab directly to
 paper on a VISTA printer from CPRS, a dashed line intended as a line
 separator is superimposed over the first header line.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Added a line feed between the initial header and the rest of the report.  
 In tag PROBB of ORWRPP1 routine, insert a CR/LF (W !) in between the 
 first header line (which identifies the user station location) and the 
 logic representing the remainder of the Problem List report.
  
 3.      R8666490FY16 - Multiple Order Errors
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The New Order alert was defined to send to the Team List. Whenever the 
 system was attempting to queue the alert to a particular team, an 
 undefined error would occur, which caused the alert to not queue.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The root cause of the problem is that somehow the 'AB' cross-reference, 
 which lists the teams that a patient is assigned to, was somehow 
 corrupted. The routine ORQPTQ1 that queues the alert has been modified to
 handle this problematic situation more gracefully. The ORLP DELETE TEAM
 function was checked and no issues were discovered.

 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes 
 to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ---------------------------
    
    1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the 
        INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
    
    2.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
        [XPD MAIN]: 
             Edits and Distribution ...  
             Utilities ...  
             Installation ...  
    
      Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: Installation
                                                               ---
             1      Load a Distribution
             2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
             3      Print Transport Global
             4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
             5      Backup a Transport Global
             6      Install Package(s)
                    Restart Install of Package(s)
                    Unload a Distribution
    
    3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
        (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*449):
  
        a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
            not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
        b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
            will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
            this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
            patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
        c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
            allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
            in the transport global.
    
    4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
        OR*3.0*449.
  
        a.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the
            install? NO//", answer NO.
        b.  When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options and Menu 
            Options and Protocols? NO//", answer NO.

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 It is imperative that the patch installer performed a backup of the
 routine included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 In the event of a major issue with the patch, the Facility CIO may make 
 the decision to back-out the patch. However, this decision should 
 include both Health Product Support and the CPRS development team.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created. If 
 this is required, the site can verify the back-out was successful by 
 verifying that the checksum matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch 
 description.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
