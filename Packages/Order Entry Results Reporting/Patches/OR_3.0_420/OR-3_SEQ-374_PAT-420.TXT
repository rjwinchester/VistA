Subject: CPRS LAB MONITORING

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
 ATTENTION (ESPECIALLY MULTI-DIVISIONAL FACILITIES):
 This enhancement will not work properly for multi-divisional facilities or
 any sites that use different lab test names at different sites, as only
 one lab test name can be associated with each drug. To successfully
 implement this solution, all facilities/divisions that share a VistA
 system must use the same name for each monitored lab test. If this is not
 feasible or desired, then do not populate lab tests in the LAB TEST
 MONITOR field after installing this patch.
  
 Example: If all divisions of your facility use a single laboratory test
 named CREATININE, then the software will work as intended. If individual
 divisions use specifically named lab tests such as KAN-CREATININE and
 WIC-CREATININE, then do not use those lab tests with this software
 enhancement.
 *************************************************************************
  
 Patch OR*3.0*420 will modify the existing Pharmacy package in VistA to
 display the most recent associated lab results when a clinician is
 ordering medication using the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
 Inpatient or Outpatient Medication Order dialogs. Without this
 modification, the clinician must look in numerous locations for this
 information. The information is important for safe and effective
 medication management. 
  
 The lab results for the most recent lab test associated with an Orderable 
 Item will be displayed in the Information field in the Medication Order 
 dialog once an Orderable Item is selected. Once a dispense drug is chosen 
 (by selecting a dosage in the order dialog), the lab test information 
 will be replaced by the National Standard Drug Information found in the
 MESSAGE (#101) field of the DRUG (#50) file. This message currently
 shows in CPRS when ordering a dispense drug and is not changed by this
 modification.  Note:  Follow-on work to allow persisitence of the lab 
 test information in the Medication Order dialog is expected to be 
 addressed in CPRS v32.
  
 In order to monitor lab results, lab tests are associated with an 
 Orderable Item using the PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT option in VistA by entering 
 a lab test in the LAB TEST MONITOR (#17.2) field of the DRUG (#50) file. 
  
 To apply this functionality to Quick Orders, routine ORWDPLM2 can be used 
 as a TIU OBJECT that can be added to a Quick Order. A site may use this 
 optionally to add to a Quick Order to allow the functionality to be added 
 to the comment section of the order. This is done by creating the OBJECT 
 using the TIU Document Definitions option and inserting it into the 
 comments field of the Quick Order. Upon selection of the Quick Order in 
 CPRS, the monitored LAB results will appear on the Ordering screen. 
  
 A KERNEL system parameter (OR CPRS LAB DISPLAY ENABLED) is added by this
 patch to turn the functionality On/OFF.  Initially, this parameter is set
 to OFF (No).  A Clinical Application Coordinator (CAC) or Pharmacy 
 Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator (ADPAC) at each site
 will need to set this parameter to the ON value (Yes) in order for this
 functionality to be turned on at the site.
  
 This modification has been implemented locally at the VA centers in 
 Clarksburg, WV; Hines, IL; Iron Mountain, MI; and Chicago, IL.
  
 The NSR for this intake addresses the following requirement: 
  
 * VHBAO:NEED126: Ability to display laboratory test results, in a single 
                  view, for ordering inpatient and outpatient medications
                  while viewing the Medication Order dialog in CPRS.
  
  
 This build contains the components for the CPRS Graphical User Interface 
 (GUI) to display relevant laboratory results in the Medication Ordering 
 dialog.
  
 To use the features, the following setup steps are advised:
  
  * Establish drug-to-lab mapping relationship using the PSS DRUG 
    ENTER/EDIT option.  Follow the OUTPATIENT marking pathway to set up a
    LAB MONITOR drug.  Lab name, specimen type and number of days to look
    back are required fields for the program to work.
  
  * If not already set correctly, review the site local terms for SERUM 
    CREATININE and SERUM SPECIMEN in the CPRS Order Check menus.  This is 
    required for calculation of Creatinine Clearance.
  
  * When the lab requested is "Creatinine", a second line for CrCl will be 
    returned.
  
 The routine ORWDPLM2 is included.  This is a version of the display that
 will work as a TIU OBJECT.  A site may use this optionally to add to a 
 Quick Order to allow the functionality to be added to the comment 
 section of the order.  This is done by creating the OBJECT using the TIU 
 Document Definitions option and inserting it into the comments field of
 the Quick Order.  Upon selection of the Quick Order in CPRS, the monitored
 LAB results will appear on the Ordering screen.  The object method to
 insert into the TIU Object is:
  
 S X=$$SL^ORWDLPM2(DFN,
 $S($G(X0)]"":$P(X0,U),$G(NODE0)]"":$P(NODE0,U),1:""),"^TMP($J,""ORWDPLM2""
 )")
  
 The display is wrapped for ease of reading, but the object method must be 
 entered as part of one single line.
  
 Note:  The TIU OBJECT method will work for generalized Quick Orders only 
 (orders assigned to Order Menus).  It is not currently implemented for 
 personal Quick Orders.
  
 If assistance is needed in setting up TIU Objects inside Quick Orders,
 contact your Clinical Application Coordinator (CAC) or refer to the TIU
 User Manual for instructions.
