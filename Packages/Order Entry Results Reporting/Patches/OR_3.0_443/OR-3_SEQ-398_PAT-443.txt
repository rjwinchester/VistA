 1. I11664086FY17 - OR DEBUG REPORT - Undefined Error
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Undefined error (<UNDEFINED>DL+7^ORDEBUG2 ^VA(200,0,0)) encountered when 
 attempting to use RPC DEBUG REPORT [OR DEBUG REPORT] option. This was due
 to a misfiled entry in XTMP("CPRS DEBUG LOG").
  
 Note: This was previously reported in SDM I11361183FY17, but the cause was
 not determined at the time and the region OI&T staff resolved the issue by
 killing off the bad entry in the global.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The RPC DEBUG REPORT [OR DEBUG REPORT] option has been modified to handle 
 potentially erroneous entries by simply showing a blank where the name of 
 the user would normally appear.

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
   
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine 
 included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
