Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Computerized Patient Records System CPRSv30 
 project. This project will modify the Computerized Patient Record 
 System, Text Integration Utilities, Consults, Health Summary, Problem 
 List, Clinical Reminders, and Order Entry/Results Reporting domains to
 meet the requirements proposed by the Dept. of Health and Human Services 
 to adopt ICD-10 code set standards for Clinic Orders.
  
 On January 16, 2009, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 
 released a final rule for replacing the 30-year-old ICD-9-CM code set 
 with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) and International Classification of Diseases, 
 Tenth Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) with dates of 
 service, or date of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or after the
 industry activation date. The classification system consists of more than 
 68,000 codes compared to approximately 13,000 ICD-9-CM codes. There are 
 nearly compared to approximately 13,000 ICD-9-CM codes. There are nearly
 87,000 ICD-10-PCS codes, while ICD-9-CM has nearly 3,800 procedure 
 codes.  Both systems also expand the number of characters allotted from 
 five and four respectively to seven alpha-numeric characters.  This value 
 does not include the decimal point, which follows the third character for 
 the ICD-10-CM code set.  There is no decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code 
 set.  These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of 
 care, so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better 
 understand complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and 
 better track the outcomes of care.  ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research.  
  
 NOTE: Functionality specific to activation of the ICD-10 code set shall 
 not be seen by end users until the code set has been activated. 
  
  
 Remedy Tickets Resolved
 =======================
   1. INC000001019974 - Shelley Weems reports Anti-Coagulation Management 
      Tool is changing an ICD code from one thing to another resulting in a
      risk to patient safety.
   2. INC000000610881 - Routine ORAM1 contained an unsupported reference 
      to the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80) global.  This has been resolved.

 Software & Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ================================================ 
 The software for this set of patches is not being distributed through the 
 National Patch Module. There is a single package KIDS build being 
 distributed.  The associated host file is named OR_3_361.KID
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/.
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as
 follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Hines          ftp.domain.ext   <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  
  
 A single documentation update is being provided with this release.  This 
 file is only available via one of the FTP download directories.

 Pre-installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 Please retrieve and review the ICD-10 Production Overview Guide Group 2 
 document referenced above.  This document is intended to provide the 
 field sites with guidance regarding the association of the ICD-10 grouped 
 patches.  The document outlines an approach for each site to install 
 several individual patches that are logically related based on technical 
 and business dependencies.  These patches have been grouped together by 
 the ICD-10 Program. Please refer to the detailed installation 
 instructions within each application specific patch description or 
 install guide after reading this document.
  
  
 It is not necessary to disable any options. You may install 
 these routines at any time without interruption to users. It should
 take less than 10 minutes to install this patch.
  
 1. Use the 'Load a Distribution' option on the KIDS installation menu.
    When prompted to enter a host file type in OR_3_361.KID
  
 2. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
    options, as desired (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*361):
  
       a. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will 
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are 
          in the transport global.
     
       b. Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
           the components of the KIDS build.
     
       c. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option 
          will allow you to view all changes that will be made when 
          this patch is installed. It compares all components of
          this patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     
       d. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will 
          not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     
 5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
    OR*3.0*361
     
 6. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
    YES//" respond NO.  
     
 7. When Prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
    and Protocols? YES//" respond NO.          
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 There are no post-install instructions for this patch.  The post-install 
 routine, ORY361, is not automatically deleted after installation.  If 
 desired, this routine may be manually deleted from the system once the 
 installation has successfully completed.
