Subject: QUICK ORDER ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses three issues with Quick Order editing:
  
 1. When attempting to add a new orderable item to a quick order with 
 multiple orderable items (such as Infusions or VBECS), an error occurs.
 2. When attempting to edit an additive in a multi-additive Infusion (IV) 
 quick order, the strength for all the other (non-edited) additives is 
 removed.
 3. When attempting to enter the name of an orderable item that exceeds 30 
 characters, the user is given the '??' response as if the entry is 
 invalid.
  
 Further details are found in the Defect Tracking System overview section 
 below.

 1. I11831268FY17 - Issues creating quick order for massive transfusion 
                    protocol
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When entering the 4th component in VBECS the Application closes out with 
 a hard error. Also, it was reported that the comment section is not long 
 enough to enter instructions.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The comments issue will not be addressed by this patch. The hard error, 
 as well as the inability to add a new component has been corrected. This 
 issue would also have affected IV quick orders with multiple additives. 
 Routine ORCDLG1 has been modified to correct both these issues.
  
 2. R15412941FY17 - QUICK ORDERS - VistA Issue Resetting
  
 Problem:
 -------
 VistA IV quick order edit is resetting all solution values to 
 0 anytime you add or delete an item. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The routine responsible for editing an additive in an IV quick order was 
 attempting to also remove any of the 'associated items', such as 
 strength. The idea being that if you changed the additive the existing 
 strength would not be appropriate. 
  
 However, it was inappropriately deleting all the strengths, rather than 
 only the strength associated with the additive being edited. The routine 
 (ORCDPSIV) has been modified to only remove the strength and units that 
 are associated with the individual additive being edited.
  
 3. I11114267FY17 - Quick Order Entry doesn't Honor Exact Entry Name
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When the user enters an orderable item name longer than 30 characters, 
 the system display the '??' along with the help text indicating the entry 
 was invalid. This occurs even if the name entered is an exact match to an 
 orderable item.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The problems stems from the fact that the style of cross-reference used 
 for this lookup only allows 30 characters in FileMan. However, it was 
 constructed allowing more than 30 characters.
  
 The solution delivered in this patch retains the current cross-reference 
 structure but modifies routine ORCDLG2 to notify the user if they enter 
 more than 30 characters and then perform the lookup with only the first 
 30 characters that were entered.
  
 The message will display: 
 Entries are matched based on the first 30 characters. Longer entries may
 result in more than one match. If this happens, please select the desired
 entry.
  
 Following the message, the 30 characters that will be used for the search 
 will display.
