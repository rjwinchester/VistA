Description:
============

 OR*3.0*441 provides the following enhancements to VistA:
  
 - Modifies the display of flagged Order comments and Ward comments to
 make them readily available on the Computerized Patient Record System 
 (CPRS) Orders tab where Clinical staff can plainly see them.
  
 Currently, the clinician must double-click the order and search through 
 activity details to find the flagged Order comment or Ward comment. Not 
 only is this search time-consuming, but it requires that the clinician 
 recognize the need to actively search. This can result in comments being 
 overlooked and not addressed in a timely manner, thus impacting patient 
 safety and care.
  
 The Flagged and Ward comments modification comes with an On/Off switch. 
 The default position is OFF. To enable the modification, use the XPAR 
 MENU TOOLS option to set the OR FLAGGED & WARD COMMENTS parameter to ON. 
 This parameter is stored in the PARAMETER DEFINITION file (#8989.51).
  
 - Enables support for tracking antimicrobial medication quick orders by 
 adding a tracking hook to enhance auditing of those orders. Sites that do 
 not wish to track antimicrobial prescribing practices using quick orders, 
 or do not use the VISN 23 Antimicrobial Clinical Decision Support System 
 (CDSS), do not need to perform the setup steps for using the antimicrobial
 hooks and reporting features described in the supporting documentation for
 this patch.
  
 The Antimicrobial Decision Tree Hook functionality is enabled by two new
 TIU Objects (hooks) added to the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file (#8925.1).
 The |OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT| hook tracks clinically preferred antimicrobial
 drug quick orders; the |OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT(ALT)| hook tracks quick
 orders that prescribe an alternative to a clinically preferred
 antimicrobial drug.
  
 This enhancement does not provide any preconfigured quick orders; the 
 quick orders must be set up and added to CPRS by a Clinical Application 
 Coordinator (CAC) or Office of Information and Technology (OIT) staff
 member. When creating an antimicrobial drug quick order, either the |OR 
 QUICK ORDER AUDIT| or the |OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT(ALT)| hook must be added 
 to the order Comments field to enable quick order audit capabilities.
  
 Note: When setting up Antimicrobial Quick Orders, respond YES at the 
 "Verify Order" prompt and NO at the "Auto-Accept" prompt. If a YES 
 response is made at the "Auto-Accept" prompt, then two pharmacy 
 confirmation numbers will appear in the new antimicrobial quick order 
 tracking file and subsequent Quick Order Audit reports. This does not 
 result in the creation of multiple drug orders.
  
 When an antimicrobial drug quick order containing one of the Quick Order 
 Audit hooks is created from the CPRS Orders tab, a pharmacy confirmation 
 number is displayed with other order information such as the medication, 
 dose, schedule, and special instructions. When the medication order is 
 accepted by the clinician, an order number is assigned; this number serves
 as verification that the order was completed.
  
 Six VistA quick order auditing options are provided with this enhancement:
 OR Quick Order Nightly Background Task [OR QUICK ORDER NIGHTLY BG], OR
 Quick Order Audit Menu [OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT MENU], OR Quick Order Audit
 Inquiry [OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT INQUIRY], OR Quick Order Audit Print [OR
 QUICK ORDER AUDIT PRINT], OR Quick Order Audit Monthly [OR QUICK ORDER
 AUDIT MONTHLY], and OR Quick Order Division Groups Edit [OR QUICK ORDER
 DIVISION GROUPS]. These options enable the various auditing and reporting
 features associated with antimicrobial quick orders.
  
 The OR Quick Order Nightly Background Task is scheduled to run by TaskMan.
 This option adds the order number to the QUICK ORDER AUDIT file (#100.95)
 if the order is accepted. The background job scheduling is set to YES and
 is preset to run at 23:01 and then to re-run at 24-hour intervals. These
 default settings can be modified by OIT staff.
  
 The OR Quick Order Audit Menu option displays the OR Quick Order Audit 
 Inquiry, OR Quick Order Audit Print, OR Quick Order Audit Monthly, and OR 
 Quick Order Division Groups Edit options.
  
    - The OR Quick Order Audit Inquiry option uses the pharmacy 
 confirmation number to retrieve order details for individual antimicrobial
 quick orders from the QUICK ORDER AUDIT file. The pharmacy confirmation
 number is displayed in the order Comments field in CPRS when the order is
 created; it is also included in the report generated using the OR Quick
 Order Audit Print option.
  
    - The OR Quick Order Audit Print option provides information about
 antimicrobial quick order usage. Date range fields are provided to limit
 the report output to a specific time period. The information in this
 report reflects provider medication decision trends because a pharmacy
 confirmation number is recorded any time an antimicrobial quick order
 containing one of the Quick Order Audit hooks is created, even if the
 order is not accepted. If the order is accepted, an order number is also
 included. This report uses a Print template and a Sort template, each
 named [OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT REPORT], to display information from the QUICK
 ORDER AUDIT file.
   
    - The OR Quick Order Audit Monthly option generates a report that
 includes details on all antimicrobial drug orders placed during a
 user-specified reporting period. The monthly report can be run for any
 period of up to 31 days for which data is present in the system. This
 report separates antimicrobial orders into those placed using a quick
 order and those placed using a method other than a quick order. 
  
 This report is intended to be exported in a delimited format to an HFS
 (HOST FILE DEVICE) at the standard device prompt "DEVICE:" for import 
 into Excel. Before the standard prompt is presented, the new prompt "Do
 you want a delimited report to a printer or home device ? NO//" is
 presented to facilitate those sites that do not have access to an HFS
 (HOST FILE DEVICE). If a user selects the default NO response, then the
 standard "DEVICE:" prompt will display and the user can choose to send a
 delimited report to the HFS (HOST FILE DEVICE) or to have a non-delimited
 report sent to the screen or other printer. If the user responds "YES" at
 the new prompt, then a modified device prompt, "DELIMITED REPORT DEVICE:
 HOME//," is presented. From this prompt, the user can send a delimited
 report to the screen or to a printer, but will have to use other methods
 (for example, turning on logging) to capture the delimited report so that
 it can be imported into Excel the same way that an HFS (HOST FILE DEVICE)
 would deliver the report. The user can additionally choose to include 
 orders that are missing a location by responding "YES" at the "Do you 
 want to print orders with MISSING LOCATIONS? NO//" prompt.
  
 Before using this report, it must be configured using the OR Quick Order
 Division Groups Edit option.
  
    - The OR Quick Order Division Groups Edit option enables editing of the
 QUICK ORDER DIVISION GROUPS file (#100.953). This file allows large
 facilities to filter the OR Quick Order Audit Monthly report into groups
 of Medical Center divisions to be included in separate reports. The
 selected divisions are stored in the MEDICAL CENTER DIVISIONS field
 (#100.9531). This field only supports selecting from existing entries
 found in the MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file (#40.8). Proper configuration
 requires each site to create one or more group names and then add all
 subordinate divisions to include in the group. When a group is added, the
 user is prompted for the divisions to include; a different subset of
 divisions may be selected for each group. Sites desiring only one report
 must include all of the Medical Center divisions associated with their
 facility in a single group.
  
 Note: The Quick Order Audit Inquiry [OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT INQUIRY] report 
 may not accurately record antimicrobial quick orders in the QUICK ORDER 
 AUDIT file (#100.95) when processing multiple delayed orders at one time. 
 Due to an issue with legacy delayed order processing of quick orders, the 
 system does not transmit all the required variables for antimicrobial 
 quick order tracking. This may result in inaccuracies when using the 
 inquiry report. However, the Quick Order Audit Monthly [OR QUICK ORDER 
 AUDIT MONTHLY] report provides accurate information for all orders and can
 be used in its place. This report retrieves information from the Order
 file (#100) and provides real-time data on all antimicrobial orders. The
 report separates Quick Orders and Non-Quick Orders and can be used to
 identify antimicrobial quick orders for verification and auditing 
 purposes. Those individuals assigned the Quick Order Audit Menu [OR QUICK 
 ORDER AUDIT MENU] have access to all of the new user options associated 
 with this patch, including the monthly report.
  
 The patch functionality is turned ON by adding one of the two new hooks to
 antimicrobial quick orders defined for the site. The functionality is 
 turned OFF by removing the hook from the Comments section of any quick 
 orders previously configured with either hook. To completely turn off the 
 Antimicrobial Decision Tree Hook functionality, the scheduled OR Quick
 Order Nightly Background Task [OR QUICK ORDER NIGHTLY BG] must also be
 turned off.
  
 Note: Sites that are utilizing an existing CDSS to select quick
 orders associated with antimicrobial drugs can continue using the CDSS
 without interruption following implementation of this enhancement. During
 patch installation, Quick Orders preconfigured with a |ZZ QUICK ORDER
 AUDIT|, |ZZ QUICK ORDER AUDIT (CI)|, or |ZZ QUICK ORDER AUDIT (NE)| hook
 will be automatically converted to the new |OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT| hook.
 Quick Orders preconfigured with the |ZZ QUICK ORDER AUDIT (ALT)|, |ZZ
 QUICK ORDER AUDIT (CI-ALT)|, or |ZZ QUICK ORDER AUDIT (NE-ALT)| hook will
 be automatically converted to the new |OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT(ALT)| hook.

 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 minutes
 to install.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 To install the patch:
  
 1.      Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.      Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
  
 3.      From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) menu, 
         select the Installation Menu. From this menu, you may elect to use
         the following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter
         the patch number OR*3.0*441.
  
 a.      Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will help
         ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
  
 b.      Print Transport Global - This option will enable viewing the 
         components of the KIDS build.
  
 c.      Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will 
         enable viewing all changes that will be made when this patch is 
         installed. It compares all components of this patch (routines,
         data dictionaries, templates, etc.).
  
 d.      Back up a Transport Global - This option will create a backup 
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not back
         up any other changes such as data dictionaries or templates.
  
 4.      From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option 
         and choose the patch to install.
  
 5.      If prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
         Install? NO//', press <Enter>.
  
 6.      When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
         NO//', press <Enter>.
  
 7.      When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
         and Protocols? NO//', press <Enter>.
  
 8.      If prompted 'Delay install (Minutes): (0-60): 0//', press <Enter>.
  
 9.      If prompted 'Enter the Device you want to print the Install 
         messages. You can queue the install by enter a 'Q' at the device
         prompt. Enter a '^' to abort the install. DEVICE: HOME//   HOME  
         (CRT)', press <Enter>.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
  
 The Post-Installation routine ORQO441P will schedule the OR Quick 
 Order Nightly Background Task [OR QUICK ORDER NIGHTLY BG] option to run
 every 24 hours at 23:01 on the next calendar day. If this is not an
 optimal time to run the option, then a member of the OIT staff must
 manually reschedule this option. This routine also creates two new objects
 in the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file (#8925.1) - |OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT| and
 |OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT(ALT)|.
  
 Sites with quick orders containing the |ZZ QUICK ORDER AUDIT|, |ZZ QUICK 
 ORDER AUDIT (CI)|, or |ZZ QUICK ORDER AUDIT (NE)| hook in the order 
 Comments field must convert those orders to use the |OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT|
 hook. Sites with quick orders containing the |ZZ QUICK ORDER AUDIT (ALT)|,
 |ZZ QUICK ORDER AUDIT (CI-ALT)|, or |ZZ QUICK ORDER AUDIT (NE-ALT)| hook
 must convert those orders to use the |OR QUICK ORDER AUDIT(ALT)| hook. A
 utility in the post-installation routine automatically performs this
 conversion. Each quick order that the utility converts is displayed on the
 screen as the routine executes.
  
 No conversion is needed at sites that do not have previously configured 
 antimicrobial quick orders using a "ZZ" prefixed hook.
  
 Routine ORQO441P is automatically deleted at the end of the installation.
  
 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of this patch, it is not recommended for 
 backout, and a restore from a backup of the Transport Global should not be
 attempted. However, in the event that a site decides to back out this 
 patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit a
 help desk ticket. The development team will need to issue one or more 
 follow-on patches in order to comprehensively back out this patch, after 
 coordination with the VA Project Manager and COR.
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the OR routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the OR routines have been backed
 out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain the
 designation of patch OR*3.0*441 on line 2 in the patch list section.
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out; it does not confirm that other patch component changes 
 have been backed out.
