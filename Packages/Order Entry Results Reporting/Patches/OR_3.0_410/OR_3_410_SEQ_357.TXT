 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000246535 - Unsigned TIU note not displayed in CPRS notifications
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The REMOVE NON-OR ALERTS WITHOUT PROCESSING [ORB REMOVE NON-OR] 
    parameter defines what non-or alerts are deletable by the "remove"
    button in the notifications list. 
  
    Non-OR alerts that have not been set up for removal are being 
    deleted. This happens when the non-OR alert follows an alert
    which is set up to be removed.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The removal flag variable from previous alerts is being carried over. 
    ORWORB has been modified to create a new flag variable for each alert.
  
 2. INC000000757637 - Typo in CPRS User Manual
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In the Consults section of the CPRS User Guide: GUI Version there is
    the following paragraph:
  
       The originating clinician receives a CONSULT/REQUEST UPDATED alert
       that the consult is complete. The results can now be examined and 
       further action taken on behalf of the patient.
  
    That alert should be CONSULT/REQUEST RESOLUTION per the Consult/Request
    Tracking manuals.
      
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The CPRS User Guide: GUI Version will be modified to say
    CONSULT/REQUEST RESOLUTION.
