Description:
============

 This patch corrects 6 issues within the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING

 1. Error on entering "^" at the Type prompt of Create/Add to Team List 
    [ORLP TEAM ADD] option.
  
 2. Team list visibility is changed when edited.
  
 3. Locks are set late when creating or renaming lists and are not set when
    removing patients.
  
 4. CPRS will allow a duplicate team list name when entering personal 
    lists.
  
 5. Occasionally, the Display User's Preferred Patient List Source [ORLP3M 
    DISPLAY LIST SOURCE] option displays the current user's list source
    instead of the selected user.
  
 6. Various ORLP options do not time out when selecting a list in use 
    elsewhere.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1.  INC000000069514   AL+17^ORLP:1 Errors
  
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 If users enter "^" at the Type prompt of Create/Add to Team List [ORLP 
 TEAM ADD] option, an undefined error occurs - <UNDEFINED>AL+17^ORLP
  
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
 Routine ORLP was modified to handle no data in the Type field and exit as
 expected. 
  
 2.  INC000000302690   OE/RR Teams no longer display to all users.
  
 Problem 2:
 ----------
 Users were editing team lists (of any type), and the VISIBILITY flag was
 being set automatically to OWNER.  This was preventing the viewing of the
 team list by users other than the owner of the team. 
  
 Resolution 2:
 -------------
 Routine ORLP was modified to only set the VISIBILITY flag when creating a
 PERSONAL PATIENT type team list.
  
 3.  INC000000070647   TYPO IN ROUTINE ORLP
  
 Problem 3:
 ----------
 Team lists are not locked early enough when creating a new
 list with Create/Add to Team List [ORLP TEAM ADD] option or renaming a
 list with Rename Existing List(s) [ORLP TEAM RENAME] option. Team lists
 are not locked when removing a patient from a list [ORLP TEAM DELETE
 PATIENTS] or a provider from a list [ORLP TEAM DELETE USERS].
  
 Resolution 3:
 -------------
 Routines ORLPL, ORLP2, and ORLP were modified to lock lists as soon as the
 name is entered.
  
 4.  INC000000069810   GUI DOES NOT RESPECT CASE IN TEAM LIST DISPLAY
  
 Problem 4:
 ----------
 Since case is not checked, duplicate Team List names are allowed to be
 entered in CPRS GUI.
  
 Resolution 4:
 -------------
 Routine ORWTPL was modified to allow CPRS to check for duplicate Team List
 names regardless of the case.
  
 5.  INC000000245729   Combination Lists
  
 Problem 5:
 ----------
 When running Display User's Preferred Patient List Source [ORLP3M DISPLAY 
 LIST SOURCE] option, results are returned for the current user instead of
 the selected user if both users have a combination list set as preferred
 list source.
  
 Resolution 5:
 -------------
 Routine ORLP3MGR was modified to not reset ORLPDUZ to DUZ when printing
 the combination list results.
  
 6.  INC000000305953   Locks Missing Timeout
  
 Problem 6:
 ----------
 Remove Autolinks [ORLP TEAM DELETE AUTOLINKS] option and Delete Existing 
 List(s) [ORLP TEAM DELETE] option hang when they try to access a list
 being modified by another user.
  
 Resolution 6:
 -------------
 Routines ORLP1 and ORLP2 were modified to add a time out and an error
 message.
