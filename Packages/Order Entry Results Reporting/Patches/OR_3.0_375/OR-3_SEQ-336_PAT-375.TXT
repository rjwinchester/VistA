Subject: Delayed order-Framestack-Cumulative Report fixes

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues in the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS 
 REPORTING package:
  
 1) CPRS defaults to "Tray" only when there is no location passed in or
    no entry exists in the NUTRITION LOCATION file (#119.6).
  
 2) Option [ORCM MENU] allows the currently selected menu to add itself as
    an item.
  
 3) When the VBEC server is down, the cumulative report on the "Lab" Tab 
    returns no information.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) INC000000219278 - Delayed Diet Order doesn't survive the admission
   
 Problem:
 --------
 The problem occurs when a user uses a quick order in the CPRS GUI to 
 create a delayed diet order for admission. If the quick order has 
 "Delivery" set to anything besides "Tray", and there is no location 
 passed in or the location used does not have an entry in the 
 NUTRITION LOCATION file (#119.6), by default it will leave the
 delivery dropdown blank, and only "Tray" can be selected. If the user
 leaves the box blank, the delayed order will be cancel when the admission
 event occurs.
  
 **Note: This patch addresses 2 of the know faults and will not completely 
 fix the issue with delayed orders getting canceled when the movement 
 occurs.
  
 This problem consists of 4 faults.
 1) By default CPRS defaults to "Tray" only when there is no location 
    passed in or no location entry in the NUTRITION LOCATION file (#119.6).
  
  
 2) The remote procedure call is not passing the parameters back in the 
    proper position
  
 Faults 1 and 2 will be corrected with this patch.
  
    The remaining  2 faults are part of the CPRS Graphical User Interface 
    (GUI), which is not controlled by VistA Maintenance. VistA Maintenance
    works in conjunction with DEV-OERR package to get GUI bug fixes added
    to each major release of the CPRS GUI, We are not in control of what is
    added to the releases; therefore we are unable to determine when they
    will be added to a CPRS GUI release. These two issues have already been
    reported in Remedy and they are currently assigned to the CPRS  
    development team, and will be addressed by a future GUI release of
    CPRS.
  
 3) If there is a selected location, CPRS uses the selected location's 
    services (if it has an entry in the NUTRITION LOCATION file (#119.6))
    even if it is a delayed order to admit. (Remedy ticket INC000000766435)
  
 4) When a delivery mismatch occurs (The QO specifies a delivery that is 
    not a valid option for the specified location) the CPRS GUI will allow 
    the user to accept the order without requiring the user to select one
    of the available options (recorded in INC000000767935)
  
 Faults 3 and 4 will not be corrected with this patch.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When there is no location passed in or no entry in the NUTRITION LOCATION 
 file (#119.6), The PATCH will allow the delivery dropdown to have the
 options: "Tray", "Dining room", and "Cafeteria" available as it was 
 original intended.
  
 Routine ORWDFH has been modified to set ORLST(3)="TCD" when no location 
 is passed in or no entry exists in the NUTRITION LOCATION file (#119.6).
 Also changed the RPC return array position of this information by setting
 ORLST(1)="" if ORLST(1) doesn't exist and ORLST(2)="" if ORLST(2) doesn't 
 exist.
  
  
 2) INC000000624848 - Option ORCM MENU allows menu to be put on it-self
   
 Problem:
 --------
 The problem occurs when a user adds an item to a menu using option 
 Enter/edit order menus [ORCM MENU] and the item name is exactly as
 the menu name. This occurs because the system is not properly 
 checking if the item is a recursive reference. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changed the code to reject a menu being placed on itself in the same 
 manner that it rejects other recursive references.
  
 Routine ORCMEDT5 has been modified to compare the ITEM variable to the 
 MENU variable. If they are the same it will reject the entry.
  
 3) INC000000832820 - OERR - Labs Tab: LAB CUM not displaying- VBECS down
   
 Problem:
 --------
 The problem occurs when the VBEC server is down. The cumulative report on 
 the "Lab" Tab returns no information. This happens because the current 
 code changes the location that the system looks for the information to an 
 incorrect location in memory.  
   
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Altered the code to prevent the location pointer change.
  
 Routine ORWLR1 has been modified to eliminate the setting of the local 
 variable OROOT.
