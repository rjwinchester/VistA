Description:
============

 **Note: Delivery of this patch is required to meet VA VistA 
 Standardization requirements. The functionality in this patch is not 
 dependent on the OR*3.0*405 VistA build (CPRS V32 COMBINED BUILD 1.0); 
 however, the GUI code needed to run the new functionality created by this 
 patch will not be available until the CPRS V32 cprschart.exe is released.
  
 OR*3.0*435 enables clinicians working in the Computerized Patient Record 
 System (CPRS) to order a new medication for an inpatient where the first 
 dose is to be administered immediately and ongoing doses are scheduled for
 administration on a regular schedule.
  
 Before implementation of this patch, when clinicians checked the "Give 
 additional dose now" checkbox in the Inpatient Medications dialog box, two
 orders were created and both were given the same priority. If the assigned
 priority was ROUTINE, then the dose prescribed for immediate 
 administration was processed during routine background processing and 
 consequently not administered immediately as the clinician intended. 
 Similarly, if the assigned priority was set to ASAP, then both orders were
 processed immediately when only the first dose required immediate 
 processing.
  
 OR*3.0*435 implements enhancements to the CPRS Graphical User Interface 
 (GUI) and VistA routines so that the first dose is automatically set to 
 the priority ASAP and the ongoing order is set to the priority ROUTINE 
 when "Give additional dose now" is selected. Sites that do not use the 
 priority ASAP can select a site-specific alternative during patch 
 installation. A Warning message notifies users that two orders are created
 and the dosing schedule and priority (ASAP and ROUTINE) are set 
 automatically for each.
  
 Although the priority of the first dose defaults to ASAP, the clinician
 may select any available alternative from the Priority field before
 accepting the order. If "Give additional dose now" is selected and the 
 Priority field is blank when the order is accepted, then the first dose 
 will default to ASAP when the order is signed. If a value for the Priority
 field is selected before the "Give additional dose now" checkbox is
 enabled, a message notifies the user that the priority will be changed to
 default values (ASAP and ROUTINE).
  
 When the "Give additional dose now" checkbox is left unchecked, only one
 new medication order is created. The dosing priority and schedule are
 based on the priority and schedule specified by the clinician who creates
 and signs the order.
  
 A new parameter [ORDER URGENCY ASAP ALTERNATIVE] in VistA enables sites 
 that do not have the priority ASAP in the Order Urgency file (#101.42) to 
 use this enhancement. If the priority ASAP is not found during 
 installation, then the installation program prompts the user to select an 
 alternative urgency from the Order Urgency file. This alternative 
 selection is stored in the PARAMETER DEFINITION file (# 8989.51) in the 
 ORDER URGENCY ASAP ALTERNATIVE parameter. If an alternative priority is 
 defined at installation, then CPRS displays the alternative to ASAP when a
 new inpatient medication order is placed and "Give additional dose now" is
 selected.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Review the Pre-Installation Instructions provided before beginning 
 installation of the patch.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system, although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 minutes 
 to install.
  
 This patch utilizes the post-installation routine ORFD435P that runs at 
 the end of the installation; the notification ""Running Post-Install 
 Routine: ^ORFD435P" displays when the post-installation routine runs. 
 This routine prompts sites that do not have ASAP in the Order Urgency 
 file to select an alternative urgency. 
  
 If the priority ASAP is not available in the Order Urgency file, then the 
 following prompt displays, instructing the user to select an alternative 
 urgency from the site's Order Urgency file.
  
   "Your sites' Order Urgency file does not contain 'ASAP', please select 
 an alternative to the "ASAP" urgency for your site"
  
 If ASAP is available, then the existing ASAP priority will be used by 
 default. The new prompt will not display, the installation will complete, 
 and the following message will display.
  
   "Running Post-Install Routine: ^ORFD435P
    The ORDER URGENCY ASAP ALTERNATIVE parameter has already been set"
  
 Refer to the Post-Installation Instructions section of this document for 
 additional details about the post-installation routine.

 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 After the final installation prompt, the system displays a series of 
 notifications related to the installation of patch components. The 
 post-installation routine ORFD435P runs automatically. The notification 
 "Running Post-Install Routine: ^ORFD435P" displays when the routine runs.
  
 Note: These post-installation instructions are only necessary for sites 
 that do not have the priority "ASAP" in the Order Urgency file (#101.42). 
 If ASAP is an available priority, then the installation of the patch will 
 complete using the priority ASAP in conjunction with the "Give additional 
 dose now" option.
  
 Sites that have the priority ASAP in the Order Urgency file when this 
 patch is installed will not be prompted for an alternative by the 
 post-installation routine; the existing ASAP priority will be used by 
 default. The installation will complete and display the following message:
  
   "Running Post-Install Routine: ^ORFD435P
    The ORDER URGENCY ASAP ALTERNATIVE parameter has already been set"
  
 When the priority ASAP is not available in the Order Urgency file, the 
 patch installer prompts the user to select an alternative urgency from the
 site's Order Urgency file. This alternative selection is stored in the
 PARAMETER DEFINITION file (#8989.51) in the ORDER URGENCY ASAP ALTERNATIVE
 parameter definition. Installation cannot continue until an alternative is
 selected. The selected alternative is used in place of the ASAP priority
 when "Give additional dose now" is selected. If the priority ASAP is not
 available and thus cannot be set during installation, the following
 displays:
  
   "Your sites' Order Urgency file does not contain 'ASAP', please select 
 an alternative to the "ASAP" urgency for your site"
  
   "Setting ORDER GIVE ADDITIONAL DOSE SITE URGENCY for System: 
 exampl.dns.domain.ext
    SITE ASAP ORDER URGENCY ALTERNATIVE:?"
  
 Type a question mark at the prompt to display the order urgency entries 
 available in the Order Urgency file.
  
   "Answer with ORDER URGENCY NAME, or ABBREVIATION, or USAGE
    Do you want the entire 15-Entry ORDER URGENCY List? Y  (Yes)"
      Choose from:

 ORWDPS1 GETPRIOR and ORWDPS1 GETPRIEN to the OR CPRS GUI CHART option, if
 not already present.
  
  
 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision to
 back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of this patch, it is not recommended for 
 backout. However, in the event that a site decides to back out this patch,
 the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit a CA
 Technologies Service Desk Manager (CA SDM) ticket. The development team
 will then assist with the backout process. The items listed in the Patch
 Components section of this patch description must be manually removed by
 OIT personnel using current approved methods.
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the OR routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the OR routines have been backed
 out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain the
 designation of patch OR*3.0*435 on line 2 in the patch list section.
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out; it does not confirm that other patch component changes 
 have been backed out.
