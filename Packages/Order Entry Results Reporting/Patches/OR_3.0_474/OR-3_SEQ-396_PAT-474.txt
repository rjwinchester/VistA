 1.  R18005975FY18 - Problem with Complications
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When a complication is entered in the normal workflow in the 
 Anticoagulation Management Tool (AMT), then the user goes back and edits
 the flow sheet, the complication is removed from the report in the
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) report.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 A problem was identified with the routine that files the edits in the Log 
 file. When the flow sheet is edited, and the system begins to file the 
 data, the AMT makes a call to file the data in the log. Even though it 
 doesn't pass the flag to tell the server to make the complications 
 unavailable on the report, that is what the routine ORAM1 is doing. ORAM1 
 was modified to only make them unavailable if the AMT specifically sends 
 in the flag to remove the complications.

 If the site leadership makes the determination that a critical issue 
 requires that this patch be backed out, you need only restore the backup 
 that was created.
  
 To verify the backout was successful, compare the checksum to the 
 pre-patch values.
