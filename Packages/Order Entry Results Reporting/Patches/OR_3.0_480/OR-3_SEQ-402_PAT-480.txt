 1. I18279537FY18 - <UNDEFINED>OPIOID+15^OCXOZ0F ^PSDRUG(8182,0)
    Duplicates: R18261188FY18, I18636533FY18, I18799158FY18    
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Hard error can occur when entering an opioid order.  This error is due to 
     another order belonging to the patient having been filed incorrectly 
     from pharmacy during the finish process.  When finishing a complex order 
     with long instructions the data returned to CPRS from pharmacy can be 
     split into multiple lines that can truncate the drug causing it to be 
     filed incorrectly.  The error can then occur when a subsequent opiod 
     order is entered.  In addition, the incorrectly filed order cannot be
     renewed. 
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modify routine ORMPS to handle multiple lines returned in segment RXE.

      following options. When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch
      OR*3.0*480:
  
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not back
         up any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch

 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch. It is imperative that you have performed a
 backup of the routine included in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created. No
 data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no rollback
 strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch description.
