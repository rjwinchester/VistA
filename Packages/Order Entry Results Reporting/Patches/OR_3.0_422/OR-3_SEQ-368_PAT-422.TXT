Description:
============

 The OR*3.0*422 patch allows the use of special characters (particularly 
 punctuation) within the Order Menu Management Menu Editor. A previous 
 VistA patch disallowed use of special characters. The patch was intended 
 to prevent display problems within ListManager; however, most sites are 
 using the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Graphical User 
 Interface (GUI) and the inability to utilize punctuation can negatively 
 impact the clarity of menu options and instructions. This modification 
 restores the ability to use certain special characters in Order Menu 
 Management so that users can more clearly specify order menu options.
  
 Use of the following special characters will now be allowed: hyphen (-), 
 comma (,), and equal sign (=). Use of the caret (^) and semicolon (;) 
 are still restricted because they are used as field delimiters in VistA.
  
 Additional changes will be made to the Data Dictionary elements of the 
 ORDER DIALOG (#101.41) file to modify the Help displayed when entering a 
 question mark at a VistA prompt. The affected fields are: 
  
 * ORDER DIALOG (#101.41) file, DISPLAY TEXT (#2) field 
  
 * ORDER DIALOG (#101.41) file, ITEMS (#10) sub-file, DISPLAY TEXT (#4) 
 field

 Sioux Falls, SD; Meade, MD; Minneapolis, MN; Omaha, NE; Richmond, VA; St.

 The NSR for this intake addresses the following requirement: 
  
 * VHBAO: NEED3045 Provide the ability for the users to include 
 punctuation and other special characters in CPRS order menu notes.
