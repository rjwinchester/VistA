Subject: OPTION ORK EDITABLE BY USER, ORQQPL4 RPC FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues in the CPRS package:
  
   1. Some users do not receive order checks after ORK EDITABLE BY USER is
      set to "NO".
  
   2. <UNDEFINED> Error that originates from Remote procedure call ORQQPL4
      LEX .

 PSPO 901 (I10028223FY16)
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. I10028223FY16 - OERR - Order checks: Can previous user setting override
                    "ORK EDITABLE BY USER"?
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When an administrator changes the parameter ORK EDITABLE BY USER to
    "NO" for a particular order check it appends the text "Mandatory" next
    to the order check in the CPRS "Options" dialog box. If a user edited
    their personal setting (ORK PROCESSING FLAG) to "Disabled" prior to it
    being not editable, they will not receive the order check, despite it
    now being labeled "Mandatory".  (PSPO 901)
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    When the Parameter ORK EDITABLE BY USER is set to "NO" for an order 
    check, the system will change all previous settings at the user level
    to "Enabled".
  
    Routine ORKMGR has been edited to detect a change in parameter ORK 
    EDITABLE BY USER to "NO", if a changed is detected the system creates a
    list of individual settings for parameter ORK PROCESSING FLAG and
    changes (to "Enabled") any that match the order check that was 
    changed in ORK EDITABLE BY USER.
  
    This patch will include a post install routine that will change the
    individual ORK PROCESSING FLAG to "Enabled" for all entities if the 
    current setting of ORK EDITABLE BY USER is set to "NO". The post
    install will also send a mailman message to the individual installing
    the patch to let them know what entities were changed. The mailman
    message will be formatted similar to the following example:

 2. I10034371FY16 - <UNDEFINED>EN+3^LEXAFIL originating from ORQQPL4
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The hard error <UNDEFINED>EN+3^LEXAFIL occasionally and sporadically 
    occurs when the variable DIC("S") gets left in memory and then the user
    uses a function in CPRS that calls the Remote Procedure Call(RPC)
    ORQQPL4 LEX.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The Routine ORQQPL4 has been modified to "new" the variable DIC prior
    to executing any other calls.
