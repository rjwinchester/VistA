Associated patches: (v)OR*3*350    <<= must be installed BEFORE `OR*3*425'

Subject: Provider Orders Management-Delayed Order Release

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This enhancement allows for inpatient delayed orders (with the exception 
 of Unit-Dose Meds orders and Diet orders) to be manually released to 
 outpatient locations. Without this modification, care to patients can be 
 delayed while providers re-enter orders previously entered as inpatient 
 orders.  
  
  
 This solution is designed to address the specific scenario in which 
 inpatient delayed orders are written for an admission event, but then the 
 patient is not admitted (post treatment/post-procedure the patient remains
 an outpatient) and the orders are required at an outpatient location such 
 as a Post Anesthesia Care Unit. Under the current functionality In the 
 current VistA system, these inpatient delayed orders cannot be released 
 to the outpatient location because the admission event never occurred. 
 After implementation of this patch, the delayed orders (with the exception
 of Unit-Dose Meds orders and Diet orders) can be successfully released to
 an outpatient location.
