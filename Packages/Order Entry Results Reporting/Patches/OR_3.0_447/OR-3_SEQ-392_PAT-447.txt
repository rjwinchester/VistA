Subject: ANTI-COAGULATION MANAGEMENT TOOL GUI 2FA IMPLEMENTATION

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 In preparation for the VA's transition to become two factor authentication
 (2FA) compliant the Anticoagulation Management Tool (GUI) requires an 
 upgrade to Delphi version XE8 in order to implement the new Remote 
 Procedure Call (RPC) Broker allowing compliance.
  
 NOTE: The SSOi service is currently disabled so the 2FA (PIV) login will 
 not come up initially for the Anticoagulation Management Tool.  You will 
 be prompted for your Access and Verify code as you are currently. Once
 the SSOi service is enabled and turned back on then you will begin 
 receiving the PIV prompt at login for the Anticoagulation Management Tool.
  
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================================
    Problem: 
    --------
    The Department of Veterans Affairs Cybersecurity Task Force has been 
    tasked by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Inspector General
    (IG) to address identified material weaknesses. This task force has
    mandated that all internal, user facing VA applications become two
    factor authentication (2FA) compliant by April 30, 2017.
  
    In order to be compliant, applications are required to authenticate
    users via Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards.
  
    Note: Usernames and password will no longer be permitted 
    for employees and contractors to access VA applications.  
      
    Resolution:
    -----------
    As part of the transition to 2FA, Anticoagulation Management Tool was 
    upgraded to Delphi XE8 to allow access to the latest version of the 
    RPC Broker implementing 2FA.
