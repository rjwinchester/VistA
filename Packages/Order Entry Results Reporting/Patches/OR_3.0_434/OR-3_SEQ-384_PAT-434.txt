Description:
============

 1. The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Graphical User Interface
 (GUI) v31.A is addressing the requirement to implement two factor 
 authentication for CPRS login utilizing the Personal Identification 
 Verification (PIV) card.
  
 2. This patch also contains components necessary for the future 
 transition from VistAWeb to JLV. In the future, JLV (Joint Legacy Viewer) 
 will replace VistAWeb for viewing external remote data. Some sites may 
 not switch to JLV until VistAWeb is decommissioned, others may choose to 
 transition sooner. This transition should be made in collaboration with 
 local Informatics staff and the JLV team. 
  
 To facilitate this transition to JLV, a new Parameter (ORWRP LEGACY 
 VIEWER LABEL) is being created that will allow sites to edit the label on 
 the VistAWeb button in CPRS to JLV. To make the change, use the General 
 Parameter Tools | Edit Parameter Values on the Vista CPRS Configuration 
 (IRM) menu. Make the change at the System level.
  
                          --- Edit Parameter Values ---
  
 Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME:    ORWRP LEGACY VIEWER LABEL   
  JLV Remote Button Label Name
  
 ORWRP LEGACY VIEWER LABEL may be set for the following:
  
      1   User          USR    [choose from NEW PERSON]
      2   Division      DIV    [choose from INSTITUTION]
      3   System        SYS    [CPRS31A.DOMAIN.EXT]
      4   Package       PKG    [ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING]
  
 Enter selection: 3  System   CPRS31A.DOMAIN.EXT
  
 -- Setting ORWRP LEGACY VIEWER LABEL for System: FO-X.DOMAIN.EXT --
 JLV REMOTE BUTTON LABEL NAME: JLV//
  
 3. Return to Clinic orders will also be introduced with this patch. The 
 VistA Scheduling application does not provide key elements necessary to
 meet patient and provider appointment scheduling needs. Presently, the
 provider is limited to entering a return date as a note in the patient's 
 record via CPRS. The provider may forget to enter a return date or the 
 scheduling clerk may not look for or see the individual note among the 
 volume of progress notes listed. Because of this issue, the clerk may rely
 on when the patient states they need to return to the clinic. This 
 situation leads to inconsistent appointment notifications to patients and
 incorrect scheduling of return appointments. This results in missed 
 appointments, available appointment slots that go unscheduled, and 
 ultimately leads to a lack of effective communication and capture of 
 Veteran scheduling needs.
   
 The Access and Clinic Administrative Program (ACAP) is a single entity 
 responsible for defining, standardizing, and coordinating system-wide 
 administrative clinic operations and management. In matters regarding 
 Medical Appointment Scheduling, the ACAP serves as the VHA business owner
 and manager in collaboration with VA OI&T. This request addresses an 
 immediate need to create a national Return to Clinic (RTC) order for 
 patients. The order will capture the appointment return date or Clinically
 Indicated Date (CID) for when the patient is to be seen. This process
 will help improve communication and expectations for when the patient is
 returning to VHA to receive timely access to care. This process will help
 enable appointment notifications to be performed in a more consistent and
 standardized manner in supporting patient centered scheduling services
 instead of by provider availability. 
  
 Patch SD*5.3*671 must be installed in VistA before users can access the 
 new Return to Clinic Order Dialog in CPRS. However, CACs can create Quick 
 Orders and add the Return to Clinic Order Dialog to any menu before the 
 SD patch is installed. If a user tries to access the Return to Clinic 
 Order Dialog before the SD patch is installed, they will see an error 
 message in CPRS stating the Order Dialog cannot be used until the SD patch
 is installed.
  
 Note: This patch, OR*3*434, and patch SD*5.3*671 are independent patches. 
 However, as explained above, the patches do share functionality and it
 is recommended that they be installed together.
