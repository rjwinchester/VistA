Subject: NOTIFICATIONS SHOWING 'MANDATORY' WHEN THEY ARE NOT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address an issue in the CPRS GUI, 'Tools', 'Options', 
 'Notifications' tab, where some Notifications are showing 'Mandatory' in 
 the Comments field when they should not.

 Ticket Overview:
 ================
 1) I13414555FY17 (RTC Defect 499678)
  
   Problem:
   --------
   If a notification has no parameter setting on any level, or if the name 
   of the team, service, location, or Division contains the text
   "Mandatory", the CPRS GUI (Graphical User Interface) will append the
   text "Mandatory" in the Comments field next to the Notification even
   though the notification is not actually Mandatory.
  
   This happens because the code is just checking for the existence of the
   word "Mandatory" in the return text, and the text returned, if no
   Parameter setting is set, is "No Mandatory/Disabled/Enabled values",
   which contains the word 'Mandatory'.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The code will no longer check for the word "Mandatory" in the return 
   text, but instead, a new 'mandatory' variable will be set if the
   notification is actually mandatory.
  
   Routine ORWTPR will create a new variable, ORMNDFLG, prior to calling 
   routine ORB3USER.  Routine ORB3USER will set ORMNDFLG to "1" if the 
   notification is actually mandatory and pass it back to ORWTPR.  Routine
   ORWTPR will then check to see if the variable is set to "1".  If the 
   variable is set to '1', "Mandatory" will display in the Comment field.
