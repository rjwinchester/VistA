Subject: ANTICOAG-LOST COMMENT AND DOSAGE FIX

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch resolves the following issues:
 1. INC3296476 - SLC - Anticoagulate Executable Software issue 2
 2. INC4221699 - Anticoagulator program randomly defaults medication 
 doses which could cause medication errors.
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC3296476 - SLC - Anticoagulate Executable Software issue 2
  
 Problem:
 --------
  
 On the Flowsheets tab, editing a previously saved entry will clear the 
 entry comments previously entered.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  
 The new entry comment is now properly saved. Editing the entry comment 
 further will not result in it being erased.
  
 2. INC4221699 - Anticoagulator program randomly defaults medication 
 doses which could cause medication errors
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
  
 Control characters (like line feeds and tabs) are being saved as part of 
 comments in the patient's AMT data. These control characters cause the 
 AMT to load the patient's data incorrectly, causing a loss of data and 
 resetting daily dosage settings back to the default.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  
 All text input from the user is filtered of control characters prior to 
 being saved. The patch also includes a post-install routine that scans 
 the AMT data in Vista and removes all control characters from existing 
 records.
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Las Vegas VAMC
 Upstate NY HCS

 prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*505).
  
 a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup message 
 of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT backup any other 
 changes such as DDs or templates. b. Compare Transport Global to Current 
 System - this option will allow you to view all changes that will be made 
 when the patch is installed c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global -

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 Post-installation routine ORAMP505 is provided with this patch.
  
 ORAMP505 first updates the new ORAM GUI VERSION parameter with the 
 expected version number for AntiCoagulate.exe, then performs a scan of 
 the AMT data in Vista to remove any control characters from existing 
 records.
  
 Back-out/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore from the backup created.
  
 The file #103 records that had control characters removed are saved to 
 the ^XTMP("ORPS505") by the post install routine. If there is a need to 
 restore the previous comments of patient's AMT data, contact the
 help desk and request help restoring it.
