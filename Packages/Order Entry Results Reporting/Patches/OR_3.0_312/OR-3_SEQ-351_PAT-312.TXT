Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Note:  This patch can only be installed at sites running CPRS.
  
  This patch contains the several changes to reports in CPRS found on
  the Reports Tab. This patch also addresses a patient safety issue
  as described in issue #1 (PSI/PSPO #970).
  
  1) This patch adds a new Pharmacy report to the Clinical Reports on the
  Reports Tab in CPRS (Computerized Patient Record System).  
  The name of the report is All Medications. 
  It includes All Inpatient and Outpatient Pharmacy data for a patient.
  The data in the report can be limited by using date range parameters
  defined by the user. To determine the data that is included, based on
  date range selection, the logic is to first look for Last Fill Date,
  then Issue Date, then Order date (depends on if the date exists for the
  drug/RX being screened.
  
  When data is added to the report it will initially be sorted by STATUS,
  beginning with Active Susp, followed by Active, followed by Discontinued,
  followed by Expired, followed by Pending
  (alphabetically within each of these groups).  Users will have the
  ability to sort the report in different sequence by clicking on a column
  header, thus sorting by that column.
  
  The All Medications report will be placed as the first item on the Pharmacy
  menu on the CPRS Reports Tab.
  
  The All Medications report supports Remote Data Views (RDV) from remote
  Facilities. Please note that remote data will not be available from all
  sites until every VA site has installed this patch. Only sites that have
  installed this patch will return remote data for this report when being
  queried. If a remote site is queried that has not installed the patch,
  no data is returned and no message is given to the user indicating that
  the remote site may or may not have data. This will not be a problem once
  all sites have installed the patch, usually within 30 days of the patch
  being released.
  
  This report was created in response to a Patient Safety Program Office
  (PSPO) Issue PSPO 970.
  The API's (Application Program Interface) created by this effort will
  also be used by the VistaWeb application to create the same report
  in VistaWeb.  VistaWeb is a web based inter-facility patient reporting
  application.
  
  2) This patch changes the Date Range selection logic for the 
  Pharmacy All Outpatient report.  Prior to this change, the report
  had no beginning and end dates, and would display all data when the report
  was selected.  With this change, the user can specify a date range
  for pulling outpatient pharmacy data. To determine the data that is
  included, based on date range selection, the logic is to first look
  for Last Fill Date then Issue Date, then Order date (depends on if the
  date exists for the drug/RX being screened.
  
  This change is being made at the request of the DoD BHIE AHLTA Project
  to allow more flexibility and so that Date Range parameters are passed to 
  external interfaces like VistaWeb and DOD queries.
  
  As part of this change the name of the report is being changed in CPRS
  to more accurately reflect the data being selected/displayed.  The
  report name will change from "Pharmacy All Outpatient" to simply
  "Outpatient Medications".  To be consistent, VistaWeb will also be
  making this change sometime in the future.
  
  This report not only exists on the Dept. of Defense Reports, but also
  on the Clinical Reports | Pharmacy menu.  The same change to the report
  name will also be made there.
  
  In the past, most of the DOD reports would include local VA data
  when the report was selected. With the installation of this patch,
  Local VA data will not be included with any of the DOD reports found
  under the Dept. of Defense Reports menu. It will still be possible
  to get local data, as well as DOD data, on the same display for these
  reports by selecting the same report under the Clinical Reports menu.
  
  3) This patch fixes a potential problem on printed reports that show
  the Lab Accession #. Accession numbers that extend beyond 10 characters
  get truncated when printed at the top of the report. For example, an
  Accession # of "SPLB 03 1648" was printing as "SPLB 03 16".  This patch
  corrects this problem by extending the Accession # column in the
  OE/RR Reports File (#101.24) to 16 characters for all reports that
  contain the Accession # column.
  
  4) This patch re-exports entries with internal numbers greater than 999
  and entries 3 (ORRP AP ALL) and 24 (ORL ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY)
  from the OE/RR Reports file (#101.24).  This is a common occurrence
  when new entries are being sent out in this file.  Entries above 999
  are considered nationally controlled entries in this file.  Locally
  created entries in this file are generally done in entry numbers less
  than 999.  If you have created or modified entries in this file with
  an internal number greater than 999 or #3 and #24, those changes
  will be lost.  To preserve any local changes, either save them off
  someplace before installing this patch, or move the changed entries
  to internal numbers less than 999.
