 **************************************************************************
  
 ICD-10-CM will replace ICD-9-CM as the diagnostic coding system.
 ICD-10-PCS will replace the ICD-9-CM procedural coding system.  Veterans 
 Health Administration (VHA) software remediation for ICD-10 enabled the 
 transition to support the use of the ICD-10 code sets; this PTF 
 Modifications project will increase the maximum allowable codes in the 
 entry, display, lookup, view, print, storage, and transmission of the 
 ICD-10 code sets in the VistA legacy and HealtheVet systems.
  
 The ICD-10 PTF Modifications team proposes new functionality within the 
 VistA Admission Discharge Transfer (ADT) module to allow up to 25 ICD-10 
 diagnosis codes in 701 and 501 transactions including 25 corresponding 
 Present on Admission (POA) indicators and to allow up to 25 ICD-10 
 procedure codes in 401 and 601 transactions. 
  
 Currently, 701 transactions allow one ICD-10 principal diagnosis with a 
 POA indicator and up to 13 secondary diagnoses with POA indicators for a 
 total of 14 ICD-10 diagnosis codes and 14 POA indicators. The 501 
 transactions allow 10 ICD-10 diagnoses codes with POA indicators. The 401 
 Surgeries and 601 Procedures transactions currently allow up to 5 ICD-10 
 procedure codes each.
  
 This OE/RR patch works in conjunction with the GMTS*2.7*111 patch that is 
 also part of the PTF ICD-10 project.  That GMTS patch modifies several
 Health Summary Components (file #142.1) to now return up to 25 ICD codes
 when pulling data for a given PTF file entry.  See the GMTS*2.7*111 patch
 description for more details about the Health Summary modifications.
  
 The following reports in OE/RR REPORT (file #101.24) will now also display
 up to 25 ICD codes per occurrence.
  
 ORRPW ADT ADM DC - Adm./Discharge
 ORRPW ADT DC DIAG - Discharge Diagnosis
 ORRPW ADT EXP - Expanded ADT
 ORRPW ADT ICD PROC - ICD Procedures
 ORRPW ADT ICD SURG - ICD Surgeries
 ORRPW DOD ADT EXP - DOD Expanded ADT
  
 This OE/RR patch will establish a default value at the PACKAGE level for 
 the ORWRP TIME/OCC LIMITS INDV parameter.  This parameter sets the date
 and time limits for an individual report.  The parameter value for the
 reports listed above shall be: T-7;T;25.  This sets a date range of the
 previous seven days up to the current date and will return a maximum
 number of 25 occurrences.
  
 Setting the maximum occurrence value to 25 will ensure that all available
 ICD codes shall be returned.  Due to how the parameter ORWRP TIME/OCC 
 LIMITS INDV is defined, a date range must also be set when setting the
 maximum occurrence value.  T-7 and T were chosen as the date range
 defaults as these are the default values used by the application when no
 user/system/package values have already been defined.
  
 NOTE: The ORWRP TIME/OCC LIMITS INDV parameter may also be set for a 
 report at the USER and SYSTEM levels.  The precedence order for these
 values is defined as: USER, SYSTEM, PACKAGE.  Meaning that a report will
 first attempt to use any USER values.  If none are defined, then SYSTEM
 values will be tried, followed by PACKAGE values.  End users and support
 staff should be trained to use an Occurrence Limit of 25 for these reports
 when setting any USER or SYSTEM values for this parameter.  Any occurrence
 limit less than 25 may not show the report reader all of the available ICD
 data.  Again, this only applies to the OE/RR reports listed above.
  
 If your sites has created local (IEN < 1000) report entries in OE/RR 
 REPORT that use any of the following HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENTS, those
 reports should also have the ORWRP TIME/OCC LIMITS INDV parameter set with
 an Occurrence Limit of 25. If using FileMan to inquire to a given report
 file entry, the REPORT COMPONENT field will indicate which Health Summary
 Component(s) a report is using.
  
 Example:
 Select OE/RR REPORT NAME: ORRPW ADT ADM DC       Adm./Discharge

 Individual users may set the USER level parameter value for any local 
 reports via CPRS GUI.  Using the Tools -> Options -> Reports Tab -> Set
 Individual Reports.  Find the report name(s), set the Max to 25, click OK.
  
 Local/Region IT Staff may set the SYSTEM (or USER) level parameter value 
 for any local report(s) via the General Parameter Tools [XPAR MENU TOOLS]
 option.
  
 1. Choose Edit Parameter Values
 2. Enter the parameter definition name, ORWRP TIME/OCC LIMITS INDV
 3. Select USER or SYSTEM as appropriate
 4. Enter the local report name
 5. Enter or (edit existing) time and occurrence limits.  The occurrence 
    limit should be set to 25.
