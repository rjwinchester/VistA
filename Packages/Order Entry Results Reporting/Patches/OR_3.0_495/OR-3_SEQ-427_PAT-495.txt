Subject: VISTA SECURITY REMEDIATION RPC REFERENCE PARAMETER TYPE RPC UPDATES

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 Patch OR*3.0*495 is being released to support the security vulnerability
 solution for the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology
 Architecture (VistA) Security Remediation (VSR) program that focuses on 
 updates to the REFERENCE Parameter Type Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs).
  
 Patch OR*3.0*495 is being released as a supporting patch for the 
 Beneficiary Travel Patch DGBT*1.0*35.  OR*3.0*495 contains data entry updates 
 to the REMOTE PROCEDURE File (#8994) that include the following.
  
 Defects:
 957767 - DEF - RPC call ORVAA VAA
 957768 - DEF - RPC call ORWDBA1 GETORDX
 957769 - DEF - RPC call ORWDBA2 GETDUDC
 957771 - DEF - RPC call ORWDBA2 GETPDL
 957772 - DEF - RPC call ORWDBA4 GETBAUSR
 957773 - DEF - RPC call ORWDBA2 ADDPDL
 957775 - DEF - RPC call ORWDBA2 DELPDL
  
 1. Remote Procedure call ORVAA VAA
  
    a. This RPC allows for an input parameter (DFN) to be passed in as a 
       reference type which could be a potential security risk.
  
    b. Changed the reference type parameter to literal in the REMOTE PROCEDURE
       File (#8994) and maximum length from 255 to 20.
  
 2. Remote Procedure call ORWDBA1 GETORDX
  
    a. This RPC allows for an input parameter (ORIEN) to be passed in as a 
       reference type which could be a potential security risk.
  
    b. Changed the reference type parameter to literal in the REMOTE PROCEDURE 
       File (#8994) and maximum length from 255 to 20.
  
 3. Remote Procedure call ORWDBA2 GETDUDC
  
    a. This RPC allows for two input parameters (ORCIEN and ORPTIEN) to be 
       passed in as reference types which could be a potential security risk.
  
    b. Changed the reference type parameters to literal in the REMOTE 
       PROCEDURE File (#8994) and corrected the Input Parameter sequence.
  
 4. Remote Procedure call ORWDBA2 GETPDL
  
    a. This RPC allows for input parameter (ORCIEN) to be passed in as a
       reference type which could be a potential security risk.
  
    b. Changed the reference type parameters to literal in the REMOTE 
       PROCEDURE File (#8994) and corrected the Input Parameter sequence and   
       maximum length from 255 to 30.
  
 5. Remote Procedure call ORWDBA4 GETBAUSR
  
    a. This RPC allows for input parameter (ORCIEN) to be passed in as a
       reference type which could be a potential security risk.
  
    b. Changed the reference type parameters to literal in the REMOTE 
       PROCEDURE file (#8994) and corrected the Input Parameter sequence and   
       Maximum length from 255 to 30.
  
 6. Remote Procedure call ORWDBA2 ADDPDL
  
     a. This RPC allows for input parameter (ORCIEN) to be passed in as a
        reference type which could be a potential security risk.
  
     b. Changed the reference type parameter to literal in the REMOTE 
        PROCEDURE File (#8994) and corrected the Input Parameter sequence and 
        maximum length from 255 to 30.
  
 7. Remote Procedure call ORWDBA2 DELPDL
  
     a. This RPC allows for input parameter (ORCIEN) to be passed in as a
         reference type which could be a potential security risk.
  
     b. Changed the reference type parameter to literal in the REMOTE 
        PROCEDURE File (#8994) and corrected the Input Parameter sequence and
        maximum length from 255 to 30.

 Additional Information:
 Integration Control Registration IA #5939 has been updated for this patch
       5939     NAME: ORVAA VAA
 CUSTODIAL PACKAGE:  ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING              
 SUBSCRIBING PACKAGE: VISTA INTEGRATION ADAPTOR                  
                         VIA will use this RPC in the VIAB*1*1 patch. One of
                         the charges to the VIA project is exposing RPCs and
                         creating ICRs for those RPCs that are already in use
                         by the MDWS infrastructure. VIA provides a Class I
                         product of services that work with VistaLink,
                         replacing the need for developers to use MDWS
                         services.  The OR*3*392 patch is associated with the
                         VIAB*1*1 patch.  
               USAGE: Private             ENTERED: JUN 26,2013

         DESCRIPTION:                        TYPE: Remote Procedure
    This ICR was created for VIA. The RPC was used by MDWS, and never 
    previously documented in an ICR.  Since MDWS already uses this RPC, and 
    VIA is responsible for exposing all RPCs used by MDWS, the CPRS 
    development team agrees to the use of the RPC. 
     
    For future subscribers there first needs to be a check for an RPC created 
    in the namespace that owns the data accessed by this RPC.  
     
    A new OR*3*392 patch will be distributed that turns on this RPC's flag - 
    APP PROXY ENABLED. The OR*3*392 patch is associated with the VIAB*1*1 
    patch. Patch OR*3*495 modified this ICR and changed PARAMETER TYPE of 
    REFERENCE to LITERAL.  This is in concordance with the VistA Security 
    Remediation (VSR) project.  
     
    The following is the definition of the Remote Procedure: NAME: ORVAA VAA   
                         TAG: VAA 
      ROUTINE: ORVAA                        RETURN VALUE TYPE: ARRAY 
      APP PROXY ALLOWED: Yes 
     DESCRIPTION:   
     Returns the policy name for a veteran with VA Advantage. If the veteran 
     does not have VA Advantage the return value will be 0.  INPUT PARAMETER:
    DFN                    PARAMETER TYPE: LITERAL 
      MAXIMUM DATA LENGTH: 255              REQUIRED: YES 
      SEQUENCE NUMBER: 1 
     DESCRIPTION:   
     The DFN is the veteran patient's Internal Entry Number in the PATIENT 
     file.  
    Returns the policy name for a veteran with VA Advantage. If the veteran 
    does not have VA Advantage the return value will be 0.
