Subject: CPRS V29 FOLLOW-UP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address issues identified with Computerized Patient 
 Record System (CPRS) version 29 during its phased national rollout.  The 
 following issues are addressed:
  
 1. A problem was identified where a left-over array from the routine 
    ORDEA would cause the Pharmacy completion/finishing process to 
    erroneously report a 'FAIL TO FIND HASH' error. CQ 21505
  
 2. An issue was discovered with editing the pick-up route on renewal 
    orders. If the parameter ORWDPS ROUTING DEFAULT was set to 'No Default'
    and the provider attempted to edit the route after accepting the
    renewed order, but before signing, a hard error could result.
    CQ 21559
  
 3. In the 29 release, a holder of the ORELSE and PROVIDER keys can 
    release a controlled substance without PIV entry.  If they enter it for
    an authorized prescriber and then choose to Release w/o MD signature, 
    they can select policy and the system only asks for an electronic 
    signature without asking for the PIV card.  This means that there is
    now an electronically signed controlled substance order without a
    digital signature.  The change in this patch causes the Release w/o MD
    signature to block this scenario with a message of "Controlled
    Substance outpatient meds may not be released without a clinician's
    signature!". CQ 21489
  
 4. Currently in the 29 release, when a prescriber's Pharmacy profile 
    becomes inactive between the time a controlled substance order is  
    signed in CPRS and finishing of the pending order, a CPRS notification 
    is not generated to the prescriber alerting s(he) to the inactive
    status. Changes in this patch and the associating PSO*7*430 patch will 
    auto discontinue the order and trigger a notification under this
    scenario. CQ 21725
  
 5. The OR EPCS CS RX BY PROVIDER option was not properly reporting. The 
    option (which is tasked) will now call the correct line tag to report
    the provider's prescriptions. CQ 21446
  
 6. The OR EPCS USERS option was not handling providers who had an expired 
    DEA number but a valid VA #. The option will now correctly allow edits
    to users who have a VA # even if there DEA# is expired. CQ 21502
  
 7. Patch OR*3*306 should not have exported the routine ORYCHKE. This patch
    will delete the routine. CQ 21484

 1. INC000000900338   <SUBSCRIPT>SAVCHG+12^ORWDXR01 when attempting to 
                      edit a renewed order
  
 Problem:
 -------
 After installing CPRS v29, errors began appearing in the error trap 
 related to renewing Outpatient Pharmacy prescriptions through the 
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). The problem was caused by the 
 mishandling of the parameter ORWDPS ROUTING DEFAULT when the value was 
 set to No Default.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The routine ORWDXR was modified to check the parameter first for the 
 default value. If that value is set to No Default, the previous (renewed) 
 order will be evaluated and the default pick-up route will be used for 
 the new order. If the previous order had no value for pick-up route, the 
 default for the new order will be Window.
