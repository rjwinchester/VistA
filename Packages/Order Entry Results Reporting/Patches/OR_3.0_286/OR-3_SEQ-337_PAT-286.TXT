Subject: UPDATE PROVIDER ON ORDER CHANGE/CHART COPIES PRINT/METRIC CONV

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects 4 issues within the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING 
 (OERR) package:
  
 1. Changing an unsigned order does not update the entering provider.
  
 2. Chart Copies are enabled for printing even when no format has 
    been set up.
  
 3. There is a discrepancy in metric measure conversions for weight between
    the Cover Sheet and the Vitals entry form.
  
 4. Delayed radiology orders are being canceled when the release event 
    occurs with a Missing/Invalid Patient location error

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1. INC000000069647   Entering provider on changed order
  
    Problem:
    ========
    When a signed order is changed, the entering provider is updated to the
    provider who is changing the order. However, when changing an unsigned
    order the entering provider is not updated. 
  
    Background:
    ===========
    When signed orders are changed, a new order is created replacing the
    old order. When unsigned orders are changed, the entry data is updated
    in the original order. 
  
    Solution:
    =========
    Routine ORCSAVE has been modified to update the entering provider of
    the New Order activity when a new order is modified by different
    provider.
  
 2. INC000000069727   SELECTED ORDERS WILL NOT PRINT
  
    Problem:
    ========
    In Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), a manual print of an
    order will have the Chart Copies option enabled even when no format has
    been set up for Chart Copies. In addition, when Chart Copies is setup
    to prompt to print when an order is signed the print window prompt
    appears even though no format has been set up. 
  
    Solution:
    =========
    Routine ORWD2 has been modified to disable the Chart Copies option if
    no format has been set up.
  
 3. INC000000427314   Discrepancy between weight on Vitals and CPRS
  
    Problem:
    ========
    The CPRS Cover Sheet is not showing the same metric units as Vitals.
   
    Solution:
    =========
    Routine ORQQVI has been updated to use the same conversion rates and
    rounding to the same decimal as Vitals.
  
 4. INC000000276742   Missing/Invalid Patient location in Delayed Discharge
                      Radiology Orders
   
    Problem: 
    ========
    The problem occurs when the user creates a delayed radiology order.
    When the event occurs the order is automatically canceled with
    Missing/Invalid Patient location for the reason. This happens because
    the location is not saved on delayed radiology orders.
   
    Solution:
    =========
    The code has been modified so that the location gets saved on delayed
    radiology orders.
  
    Routine ORCSAVE has been modified to stop the LOC variable from getting
    set to null when the package is radiology and it is a delayed order.
