Subject: MISSING TEXT ON COPIED RTC ORDERS; CANCELED RTC ORDERS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two (2) issues:
  
 1.  A "Return to Clinic" order which is copied will be missing text
     in the copied order.
  
 2.  "Return To Clinic" orders are canceled when INTERVAL is zero (0) and
     NUMBER OF APPOINTMENTS is greater than one (1).

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ===========================================
  
 1.  INC2101638: Missing Text on Copied "Return to Clinic" Orders
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When a "Return to Clinic" order is copied, the text "on or around" is
 missing before the date.  Example: The order should state "Return to 
 Clinic ABC on or around (Sep 24, 2018) for a total of 1 appointment(s)."  
 Instead, a copied order will state "Return to Clinic ABC Sep 24, 2018 for 
 a total of 1 appointment(s)."
  
 Resolution: 
 ----------
 Modify routine ORWDXM1 to force the user to edit the order which will
 include entering a new date. (The same date may be entered for the copied 
 order if that complies with procedures to have two "Return to Clinic" 
 orders for the same clinic and same date.)
  
 Routine: ORWDXM1 
  
 2.  INC2105632: RTC orders canceled when INTERVAL is zero (0)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a using the VistA CPRS CLINICIAN MENU option OR OE/RR MENU CLINICIAN
 to place a Return To Clinic" order and the Number of Appointments is
 greater than one (1), the Interval should not be allowed to be zero (0).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The patch modifies the INTERVAL item (OR GTX SCH INTERVAL) for the ORDER
 DIALOG SD RTC in the ORDER DIALOG file (#101.41).  The modification makes 
 the INTERVAL a required field when the value of the Number of 
 Appointments field is greater than one (1). The modification is performed
 by a post install routine (OR494PIV) that will be removed in a future 
 patch.
  
 Routine: OR494PIR

    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
   This patch may be loaded with users on the system.  You may wish to 
   Install it during non-peak hours. Installation will take less than 1 
   minute. 
  
   NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system to avoid 
         problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
    1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
    3. On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
    4. Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
     
    5. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
               Print Transport Global
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Backup a Transport Global
  
       To preserve a copy of the routines exported in this patch prior to
       installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport Global' option
       at this time. You may also compare the routines in your production
       account to the routines in the patch by using the 'Compare a
       Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
    6. Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu 
       and select the package 'OR*3.0*494'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
       Install? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
 Installation Verification:
 --------------------------
 Compare the checksums of the routine ORWDXM1 to the "after" checksums
 listed in this patch description.
  
 Use FileMan to INQUIRE in the ORDER DIALOG (#101.41) file for the order 
 dialog SD RTC. Review the item OR GTX SCH INTERVAL , confirming that  
 "S REQD=1" is defined in the ASK ON CONDITION value. 
  
 Example:
 -------
  
 SEQUENCE: 20.5                          ITEM: OR GTX SCH INTERVAL
   DISPLAY TEXT: Interval: 
   INPUT TRANSFORM: I +$$VAL^ORCD("NUMBER OF APPOINTMENTS")>1,X<1 K X
   HELP MESSAGE: Select an interval between 1 and 30
   ORDER TEXT SEQUENCE: 30               LEADING TEXT: with a frequency of 
 every
   TRAILING TEXT: day(s)
   ASK ON CONDITION: I +$$VAL^ORCD("NUMBER OF APPOINTMENTS")>1 S REQD=1
  
 Back-out Procedures:
 --------------------
 Restore the routine ORWDXM1 from the backup PackMan message which was
 generated before patch install.
  
 Also: in programmer mode run the routine to restore the ORDER DIALOG file 
 for the SD RTC dialog by typing "D ROLL^OR494PIR" at the programmer
 prompt.
