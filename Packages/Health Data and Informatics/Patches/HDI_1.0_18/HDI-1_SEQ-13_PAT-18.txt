 ***************************************************************************
 * NOTE: Due to the complexity of this patch, based on its association to  *
 * patches XU*8.0*671 and XU*8.0*677, it is not recommended for back-out.  *
 * However, in the event that a site decides to back-out this patch, the   *
 * site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit a CA SDM  *
 * ticket; the development team will assist with the process.              *
 *                                                                         *
 * The back-out should only be done in the event that the local facility   *
 * management determines that the patch XU*8.0*671 is not appropriate for  *
 * that facility, and should only be done as a last resort.                *
