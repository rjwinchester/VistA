 **************************************************************************
 *  NOTE: Due to the complexity of this patch, based on its association   *
 *  to patches XU*8.0*686 and PSS*1.0*211, it is not recommended for      *
 *  back-out. However, in the event that a site decides to back-out this  *
 *  patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to     *
 *  submit a CA SDM ticket; the development team will assist with the     *
 *  process.                                                              *

 *  The back-out should only be done in the event that the local facility *
 *  management determines that the patch PSS*1.0*211 is not appropriate   *
 *  for that facility, and should only be done as a last resort.          *
