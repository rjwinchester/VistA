 * NOTE: Due to the complexity of this patch, based on its association to *
 * patches XU*8.0*682 and DG*5.3*933, it is not recommended for back-out. *
 * However, in the event that a site decides to back-out this patch, the  *
 * site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit a CA SDM *
 * ticket; the development team will assist with the process.             *
 *                                                                        *
 * The back-out should only be done in the event that the local facility  *
 * management determines that the patch DG*5.3*933 is not appropriate for *
 * that facility, and should only be done as a last resort.               *
 *                                                                        *
