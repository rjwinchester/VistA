Description:
============

 In the post-init routine this patch will add data for the Immunizations (VIMM)
 Domain to the HDIS Domain file (#7115.1) and Immunizations File & Field data
 with VUIDs to the XTID VUID FOR SET OF CODES file (#8985.1). 
 
 It will also add data for the File/Fields being standardized for VIMM to the 
 HDIS File/Field file (#7115.6). These entries are being added to the files 
 for VHA Unique Identifier (VUID) Seeding which is part of standardizing the 
 VIMM files associated with the VIMM Domain. Patch PX*1*206 will actually 
 invoke the standardization VUID Seeding.
