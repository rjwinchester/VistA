Subject: FIX SUBSCRIPT/COMMAND ERRORS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch fixes two hard MUMPS errors and a problem with preferred
  and inactive terms.  
 
    $$INIT^LEXSRC2(x,dt)
  
      This is an internal API called by the supported API 
      $$STATCHK^LEXSRC2 to retrieve the status for a code.
      $$INIT returns the initial activation date for a code
      based on a code and a date passed in.  This API has been
      modified to prevent the <COMMAND> error that occurs when
      the initial activation date of a code is before the date
      passed. This problem was exposed when a site had to
      re-index the CODES file 757.02.  It was later discovered 
      that it could occur anytime $$STATCHK^LEXSRC2 was called
      for a code that was pending activation.

    $$PCSOK^LEX10CS(x,dt)
    ---------------------
 
      This is an internal API called by the supported API 
      $$PCSDIG^LEXSRC2 to ICD-10 PCS procedure codes.  $$PCSOK
      returns a Boolean value indicating if an ICD-10-PCS code
      is ok to use based on a date.  It is being fixed to prevent
      a <SUBSCRIPT> error that occurs when the date passed is 
      before the activation date of the code. This problem was 
      exposed when ICD-10 procedure codes were inactivated for 
      the first time on Oct 1, 2016.

    $$DIAGSRCH^LEX10CS(x,ary,dt,ln,fl)
    ----------------------------------
   
      Lookup by code does not return the preferred term, 
      instead it incorrectly returns the first code it finds
      which may or may not be the preferred term.  A check 
      was added to the lookup by code search in I10C^LEX10DBC
      to restrict the return to only the preferred term.
      Additionally, the lookup fails if the search date 
      includes both a date and a time.  Time will now be
      stripped from the search date before the search starts.
      This problem was exposed when term, other that the 
      preferred term were added and linked to an ICD-10 code.

    Lookup by Code Returns Inactive Code 
    ------------------------------------
 
      $$DIAGSRCH^LEX10CS(x,ary,dt,ln,fl) ICR 5681
      I10C^LEX10DBC(x,.ary,dt,ln,fl)
      $$FIND^LEX10DBC(x,dt,fl)
 
      The lookup by code search function returns inactive code.
      This only occurs when a term is linked to an ICD-10 code
      that is inactive, and a newer active ICD-10 code is added
      to the same term.  These APIs now screen on the term then
      the code preventing the inactive code from being placed on
      the selection list for a user to make a selection.
