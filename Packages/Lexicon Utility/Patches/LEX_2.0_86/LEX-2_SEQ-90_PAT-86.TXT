       SNOMED CT HIERARCHY file #757.018 (new)
       
          SNOMED CT HIERARCHY file #757.018 is a new file containing the 
          names of the SNOMED CT Hierarchies.  This is used to populate
          SNOMED related sub-sets.

      $$GETSYN^LEXTRAN1        Get Synonyms for a Code's Term
          
        This API was modified to check the Deactivated Flag before adding 
        synonyms to the output array.  Two new input parameters were added,
        one to include synonyms Designation Identifiers and the other to 
        include deactivated synonyms (default is to exclude deactivated 
        synonyms) in the output array.
         
      $$CODE^LEXTRAN           Get Information about a Code
          
        Three new input parameters were added; one to include Internal Entry 
        Numbers (IENs), one to include Designation Identifiers and the other
        to include deactivated synonyms (default is to exclude deactivated 
        synonyms) in the output array.
          
      EN^LEX10DL               Category/Pruned ICD-10 Diagnosis Lookup

        an ICD-10 Diagnosis code.
          
      EN^LEXQIP                CSV ICD Procedure Query
          
        This API was modified to include the Lexicon term in the display of
        an ICD-10 Procedure code.
          
      EN^LEXQDRG               New - CSV DRG Calculator
          
        This new API, like all of the other LEXQ* namespaced APIs, is 
        designed to test versioned data based on a date provided by the 
        user.  It test the data associated with the principle diagnosis, 
        secondary diagnosis and procedure codes used to calculate a DRG 
        Group.
          
      $$MIX^LEXXM              Convert Text to Mixed Case
          
        This API was modified to include the abbreviations that are unique 
        to the ICD-10 coding system.
          
      $$CSDATA^LEXU            Return Information about a Code
          
        Two new error checks and error messages were added to this API.  The
        first checks to see if the code is valid and if not quits with 
        "-1^Invalid Code."  The second check to see if the code is included 
        in the specified source (i.e., is the code in the ICD code set) and 
        if not quit with "-1^Invalid source for code."
          
      $$PERIOD^LEXU            Return the Activation Periods for a Code
          
        A new error check and error message was added to this API.  It checks
        to see if the code is included in the specified source (i.e., is the
        code in the ICD code set) and if not quit with "-1^Invalid source 
        for code."
          
      $$LAST^LEXU              New - Returns the Effective Dates
          
        This API returns the last activation date and inactivation date 
        for a code based on a date provided by the user.  The default input
        date is TODAY.
          
      $$REUSE^LEXU             New - Determine if a Code has been Re-Used
          
        This API determines if a code has been re-used.  A code is considered
        re-used if it has been active, then inactivated, and finally, after 
        a period of inactivation it gets re-activated but with a new term.
        This API returns a 1 if the code has been re-used.  Future dates
        (activation or inactivation) are not considered.
          
      $$REVISE^LEXU            New - Determine if a Code has been Revised
         
        This API determines if a code has been revised.  A code is considered
        revised it the term has been changed and there is no break in the
        activation history (the code remained active).  Future dates
        (activation or inactivation) are not considered.
          
      $$TAX^LEX10CS            LEX10TAX Modified to use new PXRM Subset
        
        This API calls $$TAX^LEX10TAX.  The Lexicon lookup in the routine
        LEX10TAX has been modified to use the new Clinical Reminders subset
        in the Subset Definitions file 757.2.

     ICD APIs
     --------
   
      ICDEXLK                  Special Lookup for files 80 and 80.1
  
        Application specific code (QUASAR, DIE, Lab and Scheduling) has been 
        removed and replace with generic code for all applications.  A prompt
        was added for user confirmation when only one entry is found.  
        Up-arrow "^" processing has been modified, a single up-arrow will 
        return to the user input prompt (CR1395).  Moved processing of 
        up-arrow (DUOUT, DIRUT and DIROUT), timeouts (DTOUT) into the ICD* 
        namespace to prevent collisions with FileMan.  Fixed the display when
        DIC(0) contains "S" (suppress the .01 field).  Add prompt for IEN 
        lookup when DIC(0) contains A or E (SQA finding).
  
      $$ICDDATA^ICDXCODE       Data Retrieval for 2 file solution
   
        This API has been modified to return data on local VA codes (CR 1398).
        VA local codes cannot be used after Oct 1, 1991; however there still 
        remains a requirement to display them.
   
        NOTE:  The API $$ICDDATA^ICDXCODE was part of the two file solution 
        for ICD-10, where ICD-9 remained in files 80 and 80.1 and ICD-10 was
        stored in a new and separate file.  This design was replaced by the
        one file solution where ICD-10 is stored in the same files and ICD-9
        and uses the API $$ICDDX^ICDEX instead.  The API $$ICDDATA^ICDXCODE
        will be retired Apr 1, 2017 (18 months after the ICD-10 compliance
        date).
   
      $$ICDDX^ICDEX            Data Retrieval for 1 file solution
  
        This API has been modified to return data on local VA codes (CR 1398).
        VA local codes cannot be used after Oct 1, 1991; however there still 
        remains a requirement to display them.  (replaces $$ICDDATA^ICDXCODE)
  
      $$ICDOP^ICDEX            Data Retrieval for 1 file solution
   
        This API has been modified to return data on local VA codes (CR 1398).
        VA local codes cannot be used after Oct 1, 1991; however there still 
        remains a requirement to display them.  (replaces $$ICDDATA^ICDXCODE)
  
      $$RDX^ICDEX              New API to resolve ICD Diagnosis Code Fragment
   
        This API takes a partial code (without decimal) and converts it
        to an ICD Diagnosis code. (used internally)  Examples:
  
          Code Fragment   Effective Date   Resolved to   Coding System
          -------------   --------------   -----------   -------------
          311                              311.           1  ICD-9-CM
          A870                             A87.0         30  ICD-10-CM
          E8310             06/26/2014     E831.0         1  ICD-9-CM

      $$POAE^ICDEX             New API - Present on Admission Exempt
   
        This API returns a 1 if an ICD Diagnosis code is exempt from 
        Present on Admission (POA) reporting.  POA is an indicator of 
        the relationship between a diagnosis and inpatient admission, and
        can include:
  
           A diagnosis was present at time of inpatient admission
           A diagnosis was not present at time of inpatient admission
           The documentation was insufficient to determine if condition was 
               present at the time of inpatient admission

      $$HAC^ICDEX              New API - Hospital Acquired Conditions
  
        This API returns a 1 if a diagnosis can be acquired during
        an inpatient visit.  It is used in conjunction with present on
        admission (POA) to calculate a DRG group.

     Diagnosis entry fails in option Enter Payment for certain diagnosis 
     codes and fails for all diagnosis codes where patch ICD*18*67 is
     installed (see Remedy Ticket 1085312).  
           
        Problem:
           
           Site could not enter ANY Primary Diagnosis codes in options 
           ENTER PAYMENT or EDIT PAYMENT after patch ICD*18*67 is
           installed.  Also, before the ICD*18.0**67 was installed
           there were about 90 diagnosis codes that would store the 
           incorrect pointer to file ICD DIAGNOSIS [#80]. 
           
        Resolution:
           
           Modify routines from a three slash (///) stuff to a four slash
           stuff as the Diagnosis lookup processing returns the internal 
           code of the diagnosis selected.  File FEE BASIS PAYMENT [#162],
           field PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS [#28] is expecting the file 80 diagnosis
           pointer to be updated with a four slash (////) stuff.
