  SFTP SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL:
  =======================
        
    Global Host File:                  LEX_2_118.GBL  (ASCII)
        
    The host file is 100 MB in size and could take up to 10 minutes to
    SFTP.  The preferred method is to retrieve the file from:
        
        download.vista.domain.ext.
        
    This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites 
    may also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server.
        
    Sites may retrieve the software directly using Secure File Transfer
    Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at 
    the following OI Field Offices:
        
        Hines             domain.ext
        Salt Lake City    domain.ext
  
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  =========================
  
     1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2.0*118.
         It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak
         hours.  This patch should take from 30 to 90 minutes to install
         depending on the system.
  
             Create a backup    20-75 minutes
             Load the Global    2-4 minutes
             Kids Install       8-15 minutes
  
     2)  Size/Disk Space Requirements:
  
         The changes to the Lexicon and CPT globals will result in a
         combined growth of about 80 MB of data.  The import global ^LEXM
         is about 76 MB in size.  Make sure there is sufficient space for
         the growth to the VistA globals and the import global before
         continuing.
  
  
     3)  Create a backup of the following global files before continuing:
  
             CPT                         #81         ^ICPT(
             CPT Modifier                #81.3       ^DIC(81.3,
             Lexicon Files            #757-757.41    ^LEX(
  
         These backup files may get as large as 2.3 gigabytes.  Make sure
         space is available before proceeding.  It should take from 20 to
         75 minutes to create the backup files.
  
         When you are creating a backup of non-subscripted globals, you
         are saving the entire global.  You should use the utility ^%GO
         for non-subscripted globals, and when prompted for a global,
         enter the global root (global name only, no open parenthesis,
         no file number and no commas, as shown below).  Examples:
  
             Enter            To create a Backup copy of:
             ------           --------------------------
             ^ICPT            CPT
             ^LEX             Lexicon Files
  
         When you are creating a backup of a subscripted global, you
         are saving a partial global (a file within a global).  You 
         should use the utility ^%GOGEN, and when prompted for a 
         global, enter the open global reference as shown below.
         Examples:
  
             Enter            To create a Backup copy of:
             ------           --------------------------
             ^DIC(81.3,       CPT Modifier
  
     4)  Install the data from the global host file LEX_2_118.GBL.  This
         file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
  
         This global is approximately 80 megabytes in size.  Make sure
         there is sufficient space available to load this global on
         your system.  The loading of the global should take from 
         2 to 4 minutes.
  
         From the Programmer prompt, execute the following routine:
  
            >D ^%GI
  
            Global input
  
            Device: VA5$:[ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE]LEX_2_118.GBL
            Parameter: RS=>
            Globals were saved on 06 Jun 2018  11:09 AM  Cache
            with description: LEX*2.0*118/ICPT*6.0*85 Data
  
            Input option: A
              ^LEXM
  
     5)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
  
     6)  Distribution Load:
  
         Load the KIDS Distribution from the Packman Message using the
         Packman function "Install/Check Message."
  
     7)  KIDS Installation:
  
         Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action
         "Install Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*118.
  
           Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during
           the install?" prompt.
  
           Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
           Menu Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
  
         The KIDs install should take from 8-15 minutes
  
     8)  Cleanup
  
         a)  The Environment Check routine LEX2118 and the Post-Install 
             routine LEX2118P should be deleted using the KERNEL option 
             'Delete Routines' [XTRDEL] upon completion of the
             installation.
  
             NOTE:  The installation of this patch should trigger an
                    update protocol and may spawn background tasks for 
                    the Clinical Reminders or Consult packages.  You 
                    do not need to wait for these background jobs to 
                    complete to delete the Environment Check and 
                    Post-Install routines.
  
     9)  Back-out Plan:
  
         To back-out data from a production account could cause broken 
         pointers, <UNDEFINED> errors and hard MUMPS crashes.  The 
         back-out plan for data only patches is to report your findings
         and wait for a repair patch.  Contact Help desk to log a ticket. 
  
    10)  Patch Verification:
  
         Kernel Installation & Distribution System-> Utilities-> Install
         File Print option can be used to check for any errors plus the
         status of the install being Completed.
