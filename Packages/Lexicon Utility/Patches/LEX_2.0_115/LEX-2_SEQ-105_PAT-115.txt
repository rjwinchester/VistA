  SFTP SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL:
  =======================
        
    Global Host File:                  LEX_2_115.GBL  (ASCII)
        
    The host file is 76 KB in size and could take up to 1 minute to SFTP.
    The preferred method is to retrieve the file from:
        
        download.vista.domain.ext.
        
    This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
    also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
        
    Sites may retrieve the software directly using Secure File Transfer
    Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following
    OI Field Offices:
        
        Hines             domain.ext

         It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak
         hours.  This patch should take up to 1 minute to install.
   
             Create a backup    50-90 minutes
             Load the Global        1 minute or less
             Kids Install           1 minute or less
  
     2)  Create a backup of the following global files before continuing:
  
             CPT                         #81         ^ICPT(
             Lexicon Files            #757-757.41    ^LEX(
  
         These backup files may get as large as 2 gigabytes.  Make sure
         space is available before proceeding.  It should take from to
         minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes to create the backup files.
  
         When you are creating a backup of non-subscripted globals, you are
         saving the entire global.  You should use the utility ^%GO for
         non-subscripted globals, and when prompted for a global, enter 
         the global root (global name only, no open parenthesis, no file
         number and no commas, as shown below).  Examples:
  
             Enter            To create a Backup copy of:
             ------           --------------------------
             ^ICPT            CPT
             ^LEX             Lexicon Files
  
     3)  Install the data from the global host file LEX_2_115.GBL.  This
         file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
  
         This global is approximately 61 kilobytes in size.  Make sure
         there is sufficient space available to load this global on
         your system.  The loading of the global should take 1 minute
         or less.
  
         From the Programmer prompt, execute the following routine:
  
            >D ^%GI
            
            Global input
            
            Device: VA5$:[ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE]LEX_2_115.GBL
            Parameters? "RS" => 
            Globals were saved on 15 Oct 2017   3:52 PM   Cache
            with description: LEX*2.0*115/ICPT*6.0*82 Data
            
            Input option: A
            ^LEXM
  
     4)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
  
     5)  Distribution Load:
  
         Load the KIDS Distribution from the Packman Message using the
         Packman function "Install/Check Message."
  
     6)  KIDS Installation:
  
         Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action
         "Install Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*115.
  
           Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during
           the install?" prompt.
  
           Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
           Menu Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
  
         The KIDs install should take less than a minute.
  
     7)  Cleanup
  
         a)  The Environment Check routine LEX2115 and the Post-Install 
             routine LEX2115P should be deleted using the KERNEL option 
             'Delete Routines' [XTRDEL] upon completion of the
             installation.
  
             NOTE:  The installation of this patch should trigger an
                    update protocol and may spawn background tasks for 
                    the Clinical Reminders or Consult packages.  You 
                    do not need to wait for these background jobs to 
                    complete to delete the Environment Check and 
                    Post-Install routines.
  
     8)  Back-out Plan:
  
         To back-out data from a production account could cause broken 
         pointers, <UNDEFINED> errors and hard MUMPS crashes.  The back-out
         plan for data only patches is to report your findings and wait for
         a repair patch.  Contact the Enterprise Service Desk to log an 
         Incident to the NTL.APP.VistA.Clinical Lexicon 2_0 category which 
         assigns the ticket to the appropriate National Support team.
  
     9)  Patch Verification:
  
         Kernel Installation & Distribution System-> Utilities-> Install
         File Print option can be used to check for any errors plus the
         status of the install being Completed.
