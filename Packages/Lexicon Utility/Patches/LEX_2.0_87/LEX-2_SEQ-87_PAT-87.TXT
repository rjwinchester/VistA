  FTP SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL:
  =======================
  
    Global Host File:                  LEX_2_87.GBL  (ASCII)
  
    The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.domain.ext,
    which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
  
    The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP
    location at the following locations:
  
         Hines           ftp.domain.ext
         Albany          ftp.domain.ext
         Salt Lake       ftp.domain.ext
 
         Files are available in the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory. 
  
    It may take up to from 30 to 50 minutes to download from the FTP site.
 
 
  DISK SPACE REQUIREMENTS
  =======================
 
    Temporary disk space required:
 
         Global Hostfile LEX_2_87.GBL      851 MB
         ^LEXM Import Global               640 MB  
 
       The ^LEXM global is deleted by the Post-install and the global
       hostfile can be deleted from the system when no longer needed.
 
    Permanent disk space required:
                                         Additional
                     Before    After   Permanent Space

            TOTAL   901 MB    906 MB       5 MB
 
    The distribution is large but the total growth is relatively small.
    The advantage is that users may stay on the system during the install.
 
  
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  =========================
  
    1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2.0*87.
        It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak
        hours.  This patch should take from 113 to 145 minutes to 
        install depending on the system.
 
            Create a backup    60 -  90 minutes
            Load the Global    13 -  20 minutes
            Kids Install       45 -  75 minutes
            Total             118 - 185 minutes 
 
            All estimated times are based on a VMS system, Linux systems
            will be faster.
  
    2)  Create a backup of the following global files before continuing:
  
            ICD DIAGNOSIS               #80         ^ICD9(
            ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE     #80.1       ^ICD0(
            DRG                         #80.2       ^ICD(
            ICD CODING SYSTEMS          #80.4       ^ICDS(
            DRG SURGICAL HIERARCHY      #80.5       ^ICDRS(
            Lexicon Files            #757-757.41    ^LEX(
  
         These backup files may get as large as 2.2 gigabytes.  Make sure
         space is available before proceeding.  It should take from 60 to
         90 minutes to create the backup files.
  
         When you are creating a backup of non-subscripted globals, you are
         saving the entire global.  You should use the utility ^%GO for
         non-subscripted globals, and when prompted for a global, enter 
         the global root (global name only, no open parenthesis, no file
         number and no commas, as shown below).  Examples:
 
             Enter            To create a Backup copy of:
             ------           --------------------------
             ^ICD9            ICD DIAGNOSIS
             ^ICD0            ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURES
             ^ICDS            ICD CODING SYSTEMS
             ^ICD             DRG
             ^ICDRS           DRG SURGICAL HIERARCHY
             ^LEX             Lexicon Files
 
     3)  Install the data from the global host file LEX_2_87.GBL.  This
         file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
  
         This global is approximately 620 megabytes in size.  Make sure
         there is sufficient space available to load this global with
         journaling on.  The loading of the global should take from 
         13 to 20 minutes.
 
         From the Programmer prompt, execute the following routine:
              
           >D ^%GI
           
           Global input
           
           Device: VA5$:[ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE]LEX_2_87.GBL
           Parameters? "RS" => 
           Globals were saved on 13 Jun 2014   9:50 AM   Cache
           with description: LEX*2.0*87/ICD*18.0*68 Data
           
           Input option: A
           ^LEXM
 
     4)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
  
     5)  Distribution Load:
  
         Load the KIDS Distribution from the Packman Message using the
         Packman function "Install/Check Message."
  
     6)  KIDS Installation:
  
         Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action
         "Install Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*87.
 
           Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during
           the install?" prompt.
  
           Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
           Menu Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
  
         The KIDs install should take from 45 to 75 minutes.
  
     7)  Cleanup
         
         The Environment Check routine LEX2087 and the Post-Install routines 
         LEX2087A and LEX2087P should be deleted using the KERNEL option 
         'Delete Routines' [XTRDEL] upon completion of the installation.
 
         NOTE:  The installation of this patch should trigger an update 
                protocol and may spawn background tasks for the Clinical 
                Reminders or Consult packages.  You do not need to wait for
                these background jobs to complete to delete the Environment 
                Check and Post-Install routines.
  
     8)  Post-Install Messages (informational)
 
         a)  You should receive an install message that includes the account,
             the start time, the completion time and elapsed time for the 
             install.  Example:
