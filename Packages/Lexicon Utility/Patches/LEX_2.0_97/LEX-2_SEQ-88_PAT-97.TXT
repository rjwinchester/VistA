  FTP SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL:
  =======================
 
    Global Host File:                  LEX_2_97.GBL  (ASCII)
 
    The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.domain.ext,
    which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
 
    The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP
    location at the following locations:
 
         Hines           ftp.domain.ext
         Albany          ftp.domain.ext
         Salt Lake       ftp.domain.ext
 
         Files are available in the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory. 
 
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  =========================
 
     1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2.0*97.
         It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak
         hours.  This patch should take from 97 to 170 minutes to install
         depending on the system.
 
             Create a backup    30 -  70 minutes
             Load the Global     7 -  10 minutes
             Kids Install       30 -  60 minutes
             Total              67 - 140 minutes
 
         Note:  Times given are for a VSM system.  Expect much faster 
                times on a Linux system.
 
     2)  Size/Disk Space Requirements:
     
         The changes to the Lexicon, ICD and CPT globals will result in a
         combined growth of about 11 MB of data.  The import global ^LEXM
         is about 330 MB in size.  Make sure there is sufficient space for
         the growth to the VistA globals and the import global before
         continuing.
 
     3)  Create a backup of the following global files before continuing:
 
             ICD Diagnosis               #80         ^ICD9(
             CPT                         #81         ^ICPT(
             CPT Modifier                #81.3       ^DIC(81.3,
             Lexicon Files            #757-757.41    ^LEX(
             Lexicon Subsets            #757.2       ^LEXT(
 
         These backup files may get as large as 2 gigabytes.  Make sure
         space is available before proceeding.  It should take from 30 to
         70 minutes to create the backup files.
 
         When you are creating a backup of non-subscripted globals, you are
         saving the entire global.  You should use the utility ^%GO for
         non-subscripted globals, and when prompted for a global, enter 
         the global root (global name only, no open parenthesis, no file
         number and no commas, as shown below).  Examples:
 
             Enter            To create a Backup copy of:
             ------           --------------------------
             ^ICD9            ICD Diagnosis
             ^ICPT            CPT
             ^LEX             Lexicon Files
             ^LEXT            Lexicon Subsets
 
         When you are creating a backup of a subscripted global, you are
         saving a partial global (a file within a global).  You should use
         the utility ^%GOGEN, and when prompted for a global, enter the open
         global reference (as shown below).  Examples:
 
             Enter            To create a Backup copy of:
             ------           --------------------------
             ^DIC(81.3,       CPT Modifier
 
     4)  Install the data from the global host file LEX_2_97.GBL.  This
         file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
 
         This global is approximately 328 megabytes in size.  Make sure
         there is sufficient space available to load this global with
         journaling on.  The loading of the global should take from 
         7 to 10 minutes.
 
         From the Programmer prompt, execute the following routine:
 
            D ^%GI
            
            Global input
            
            Device: VA5$:[ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE]LEX_2_97.GBL
            Parameters? "RS" => 
            Globals were saved on 23 Sep 2014   5:42 PM   Cache
            with description: LEX*2.0*97/ICPT*6.0*69/ICD*18.0*76 Data
            
            Input option: A
            ^LEXM
 
     5)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
 
     6)  Distribution Load:
 
         Load the KIDS Distribution from the Packman Message using the
         Packman function "Install/Check Message."
 
     7)  KIDS Installation:
 
         Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action
         "Install Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*97.
 
           Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during
           the install?" prompt.
 
           Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
           Menu Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
 
         The KIDs install should take from 30-60 minutes
 
     8)  Cleanup
 
         a)  The Environment Check routine LEX2097 and the Post-Install 
             routine LEX2097P should be deleted using the KERNEL option 
             'Delete Routines' [XTRDEL] upon completion of the
             installation.
 
             NOTE:  The installation of this patch should trigger an
                    update protocol and may spawn background tasks for 
                    the Clinical Reminders or Consult packages.  You 
                    do not need to wait for these background jobs to 
                    complete to delete the Environment Check and 
                    Post-Install routines.
