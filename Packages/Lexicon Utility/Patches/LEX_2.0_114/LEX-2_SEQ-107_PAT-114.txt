Subject: LEXICON DEFECT PATCH OCT 2017

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch includes fixes for two defects found during SQA required for
  testing quarterly data and two defects found by developers when uploading
  quarterly ICD/CPT data into the Lexicon, CPT and ICD files.
                                         
  While these defects need to be fixed to function correctly and to 
  maintain the code set versioning data set, none of these defects 
  affect the general operation of VistA.

    Defects:
                                         
      1)  ICD Diagnosis Query
          -------------------
                                         
              Problem:   Unable to display information about future 
                         activated ICD Diagnosis code (pending) when the 
                         "Assumed Date of Service" is equal to or greater
                         than the initial activation effective date.
                                         
              Cause:     The lookup evokes a special lookup routine which
                         is versioned.  Since the code is not active yet,
                         it will fail the output transformation and the
                         query will quit.  
                                         
              Solution:  Create a new un-versioned lookup that searches
                         for ICD Diagnosis codes past, present and future.

      2)  ICD Procedure Query 
          ------------------- 
                                         
              Problem:   Unable to display information about future 
                         activated ICD Procedure code (pending) when the 
                         "Assumed Date of Service" is equal to or greater
                         than the initial activation effective date.
                                         
              Cause:     The lookup evokes a special lookup routine which
                         is versioned.  Since the code is not active yet,
                         it will fail the output transformation and the
                         query will quit.  
                                         
              Solution:  Create a new un-versioned lookup that searches
                         for ICD Procedure codes past, present and future.

      3)  Control Characters
          ------------------
                                         
              Problem:   The software incorrectly strips out curved 
                         single quote marks. (extended ASCII codes 
                         #145 and #146)
                                         
                         Patient's becomes Patients
                                         
              Cause:     The curved single quote marks (extended ASCII
                         codes #145 and #146) were not previously 
                         identified for replacement. All control 
                         characters and extended ASCII codes not 
                         identified for replacement were removed.
                                         
              Solution:  Replace the curved single quote (extended 
                         ASCII codes $145 and #146) with the straight 
                         single quote (ASCII code #39). (sub-routine
                         CTL^LEXXMC)
                                         
                         Patient's remains Patient's
                                         
              Routine:   LEXXMC
  
      4)  Mixed Case
          ----------
                                         
              Problem:   When a term contains more than one sentence 
                         the software incorrectly identifies the case 
                         of the leading word of the second sentence.
                                         
                         X="this is one. that is two",Y=$$MIX^LEXXMC(X)
                         Y="This is one. that is two"
                                         
              Cause:     It had not been previously anticipated that a 
                         single clinical term would contain multiple 
                         sentences.  As a result the software does not 
                         look for multiple sentences nor apply case rules
                         to the second (or following) sentence.
                                         
              Solution:  Add a new sub-routine that checks a term for 
                         multiple sentences and applies case logic to 
                         the second or following sentence. (sub-routine
                         PS^LEXXMC)
                                         
                         X="this is one. that is two",Y=$$MIX^LEXXMC(X)
                         Y="This is one. That is two"

     5)  Distribution Load:
                                         
         Load the KIDS Distribution from the Packman Message using the
         Packman function "Install/Check Message."
                                         
     6)  Distribution Checks (optional/recommended):
                                         
         Using the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, 
         select the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect
         to use the following options. When prompted for the INSTALL
         NAME enter the patch LEX*2.0*114.
                                         
           a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a 
               backup message of any routines exported with this patch. 
                                         
           b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
               will allow you to view all changes that will be made by
               this patch when it is installed.  It compares all 
               components of this patch to the environment.
                                         
           c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will 
               compare the routine checksums listed in the transport global
               to the routines contained in the transport global.  It will
               report whether the listed checksums passed or failed.
                                         
     7)  KIDS Installation:
                                         
         Using the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu,
         select the Installation Menu.  From this menu, select the menu
         item Install Package(s).
                                         
            When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch LEX*2.0*114.
                                         
            At the "INHIBIT LOGONs during the install" prompt accept the
            default "NO"
                                         
            At the "DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols"
            prompt accept the default "NO             
                                         
         The KIDS installation should take less than a minute.
                                         
     8)  Post-Install:
                                         
         The Environment Check routine LEX2114 should be deleted using the 
         KERNEL option 'Delete Routines' [XTRDEL] upon completion of the 
         installation.
                                         
     9)  Back-out Plan:
                                         
         Use the ^%RI utility and load the routines from the backup file
         created in step #3.  Compare the environment checksums to the 
         "before" checksums listed in this patch to see if they match.
         If they match then the account has been restored to its previous
         state and LEX*2.0*114 has been backed out.
                                         
     10) Patch Verification:
                                         
         Kernel Installation & Distribution System-> Utilities-> Install
         File Print option can be used to check for any errors plus the
         status of the install being completed.
