 Description:
 ===========
 This patch creates a new global named UCUM CODES, file #757.5. The UCUM
 CODES file contains the Table of Examples of UCUM codes for Electronic
 Messaging - Version 1.3 found at https://loinc.org/usage/units. From the
 preface:
 
 This table of examples does not include all possible UCUM codes. It does
 include those needed for routine laboratory and clinical measures. See
 http://unitsofmeasure.org for the full UCUM specification.  This table
 was compiled by the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of
 Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services with content
 contributions from Intermountain Healthcare and the Regenstrief
 Institute.
