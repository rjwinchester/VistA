Subject: Release of IHTA 8.0

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Integrated Home Telehealth Application (IHTA) is a Web-based portal
 sponsored by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of
 Telehealth Services (OTS).  IHTA was first architected and developed
 under the Home Telehealth Infrastructure Enhancement (HTIE) project.  The
 development of IHTA has continued under the subsequent Home Telehealth
 Capability Enhancement (HTCE) project, and the current Home Telehealth
 Reporting Enhancements (HTRE) project. In all phases of the project
 IHTA has worked with the Census and Survey and Sustainment side of the HT
 Product Development organization to support OTS business requirements.
  
 IHTA 8.0 builds on the current IHTA 7.5 release with enhancements to
 the Census Activity Reports for All VISN the ability to drill-down from
 the VISN level report outputs. In addition, the Disease Management 
 Protocol (DMP) is retired and will no longer be available to end users.
  
 Intended users of IHTA include National, Veterans Integrated Service
 Network (VISN) and Facility Administrators, Care Coordinators, PSAs,
 Program, Office Managers, National Home Telehealth Training Center 
 (NHTTC) staff, and VHA SMEs.
