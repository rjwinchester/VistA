 EMERGENCY MHV*1.0*22 Workload Credit-ICD-10
  
 Secure Messaging (SM) allows patients and clinicians to email each other
 securely and confidentially, and allows clinicians to post those email
 threads to the medical record as progress notes.
 Relationships between patients and clinicians are established based on
 Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) providers, clinic appointments and
 Order Entry/Results Reporting (OE/RR) teams.  Secure Messaging uses 
 triage groups based on these relationships to manage which patients are
 able to email which providers.  More information on secure messaging can
 be found on the MyHealtheVet (MHV) product web site (intranet)
 http://vaww1.domain.ext/MyHealtheVet/, and MHV web site www.myhealth.domain.ext.
  
 Summary
 -------
 This patch addresses issues related to ICD-10 lookup in VistA 
 that impact the providers using SM Workload Credit functionality.
  
 My HealtheVet (MHV) Emergency VistA Patch (MHV*1.0*22) will address 
 the following two issues related to VistA ICD-10 lookup used in the 
 SM Workload Credit functionality, and a defect identified with the
 prior released patch MHV*1.0*11:
  
 1.      JAZZ Story 226244: SM WLC - ICD10 - Workload Credit Issue -
 Corrects the lookup of the ICD-10 Diagnosis as nationally mandated after 
 October 1st, 2015.
  
 2.      JAZZ Story 223914: SM WLC - ICD10 - SNOMED CT Problem List and
 Workload Credit Encounter Completion.
 The patch is correcting the lookup of the Patient Problem List, enabling 
 retrieval of only the Problem items from a patient record that have been 
 mapped to a SNOMED-CT and  ICD-10,consistent with CPRS functionality 
 after October 1st,2015.This fix will prevent inadequate encounter 
 entries from being created (action required encounters), that show up on
 the VistA Admin reports.
  
 3.      JAZZ Defect 218690: Patch MHV*1.0*11 Fix Patch Install History
          - Help Desk Remedy Ticket:INC000001307008.
 The previous MHV patch MHV*1.0*11 released from FORUM had a patch
 configuration parameter missing (the Package Link parameter was blank).
 This has caused the patch to be installed at the sites without being
 linked to the MHV package. This resulted in the MHV Patch, MHV*1.0*11, not
 being filed properly with the package install history under the MHV
 Package, and therefore, any MHV subsequent patches that required this
 patch would not be able to be installed.
 This patch will apply the fix to the MHV package install history during
 the patch pre-install while running the pre-install routine MHV1P22.
