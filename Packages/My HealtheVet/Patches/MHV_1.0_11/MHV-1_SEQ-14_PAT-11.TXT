Subject: MHV 12.14 Secure Messaging (SM) WORKLOAD CREDIT RELEASE

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 MHV*1.0*11 SECURE MESSAGING WORKLOAD CREDIT RELEASE
  
 Secure Messaging (SM) allows patients and clinicians to email each other
 securely and confidentially, and allows clinicians to post those email
 threads to the medical record as progress notes.
 Relationships between patients and clinicians are established based on
 Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) providers, clinic appointments and
 Order Entry/Results Reporting (OE/RR) teams.  Secure Messaging uses 
 triage groups based on these relationships to manage which patients are
 able to email which providers.  More information on secure messaging can
 be found on the MyHealtheVet (MHV) product web site (intranet)
 http://vaww1.domain.ext/MyHealtheVet/, and MHV web site www.myhealth.domain.ext.
  
 This patch allows the Secure Messaging server to communicate with VistA 
 to retrieve and validate the Event Capture System (ECS) data elements 
 that are needed to file a record in the Event Capture System, and then
 link the ECS record to the SM Text Integration Utility (TIU)
 Note containing the provider/patient communication message.
  
 Summary
 -------
 MHV*1*11 installs:
         1.- New VISTA HL7 protocols and routines to support the new 
 functionality for My HealtheVet (MHV) Release 12.14-Secure Messaging (SM)

 Detailed description
 --------------------
 Secure Messaging (SM) allows patients and clinicians to email each other 
 securely and confidentially, and allows clinicians to post those email 
 threads to the medical record as progress notes.
  
 This patch allows the Secure Messaging server to communicate with VistA 
 to retrieve and validate the Event Capture System (ECS) data elements 
 that are needed to file a record in the Event Capture System, and then
 link the ECS record to the SM TIU Note containing the provider/patient
 communication message.  
  
 It implements the following new HL7 message interfaces in MHV namespace:
      1- Query the SM DSS Units that a Provider has access to at a 
 specific location

 Patch Installation:
 ===================
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 It is recommended that this patch be installed by the compliance date to
 take advantage of Rel 12.14 SM new functionality.
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  The patch is distributed in KIDS format
 in a PackMan message.  This patch requires MHV*1*10 and installation time 
 is less than 5 minutes. 
  
 Required Pre-Installation Data Validation for Secure Messaging Clinics
 ======================================================================
 Before installing the patch MHV*1.0*11 on a VistA account, it is 
 required that all the SM Clinics in the Hospital Location File #44 
 have values in both INSTITUTION (field #3) and DIVISION (field #3.5).
 The INSTITUTION field value has to match the Location of the 
 DSS Unit/Event Code Screens that are associated with the SM Clinic.
  
 The following are the validation steps: 
  
    a.   Run a FileMan Search with the following parameters
    -------------------------------------------------------
 To print and validate that all Secure Messaging Clinics (CREDIT STOP 
 CODE=719) have values for both INSTITUTION and DIVISION fields, in
 FileMan:
 Select VA FileMan Option: Search File Entries
 OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: INSTALL// Hospital Location    (5900 entries)
   -A- SEARCH FOR HOSPITAL LOCATION FIELD: Credit Stop Code  
   -A- CONDITION: =  EQUALS
   -A- EQUALS CLINIC STOP: 719  MHV SECURE MESSAGING     719     
   -B- SEARCH FOR HOSPITAL LOCATION FIELD: 
 IF: A//     CREDIT STOP CODE EQUALS 523 (MHV SECURE MESSAGING)
 STORE RESULTS OF SEARCH IN TEMPLATE: 
 SORT BY: NAME// 
 START WITH NAME: FIRST// 
 FIRST PRINT FIELD: NUMBER
 THEN PRINT FIELD: .01  NAME
 THEN PRINT FIELD: 3  INSTITUTION
 THEN PRINT FIELD: 3.5  DIVISION
 THEN PRINT FIELD: 
 Heading (S/C): HOSPITAL LOCATION SEARCH  Replace 
 DEVICE: HOME;132;999   SSH VIRTUAL TEMINAL
 HOSPITAL LOCATION SEARCH

 NUMBER        NAME                            INSTITUTION       DIVISION
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    b.   Verify both fields INSTITUTION and DIVISION have values for each 
 clinic.
         
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    c.   Confirm and update the Clinics with any missing values.
         ------------------------------------------------------- 
         Contact the Site's MHV and MCA/DSS Coordinators and then edit 
         all of the SM Clinics that are missing either field with the 
 correct values.
  
    e.   Run the FileMan Search again at step a. 
         ---------------------------------------
         to ensure all the clinics are setup correctly
  
    f.   Proceed with the install of the patch MHV*1.0*11.
