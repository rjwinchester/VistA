Description:
============

 ************************************************************************
 Please note the short install compliance date of Thursday, Sept 28, 2017
 for this Emergency Patch.
 ************************************************************************ 
 * MyHealtheVet patch MHV*1*29, must be installed no later than 
 * Thursday, Sept 28, 2017, because it is a dependency for the
 * release of the Secure Messaging Web Portal functionality that
 * will be pushed to sites the evening of Saturday Sept 30th, 2017.
 ************************************************************************
  
 Secure Messaging (SM) allows patients and clinicians to email each other
 securely and confidentially, and allows clinicians to post those email
 threads to the medical record as progress notes.
  
 Relationships between patients and clinicians are established based on
 Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) providers, clinic appointments and
 Order Entry/Results Reporting (OE/RR) teams.  Secure Messaging uses 
 triage groups based on these relationships to manage which patients are
 able to email which providers.  
  
 More information on Secure Messaging can
 be found on the MyHealtheVet (MHV) product web site (intranet)
 http://vaww1.domain.ext/MYHEALTHEVET/ and MHV web site www.myhealth.domain.ext.
  
 Summary
 -------
 This patch addresses the critical issue related to retrieving User Name
 Components containing special characters (space, apostrophe, single quote 
 and dash/hyphen), and enhances the query response to retrieve additional
 SM User data fields values from VistA.
       
 This has an impact for the SM Providers with special characters in their 
 name. They are prevented from logging into SM and cannot save to CPRS the
 communication with their patients on an SM Message thread, causing
 a "Name Mismatch" error.
 The additional User profile attributes retrieved from VistA will provide 
 enhanced capability for the SM Admin to match the correct provider 
 identity when activating a new SM User, and provide the information needed
 when debugging Workload Credit and PCMM issues.
  
 My HealtheVet (MHV) Emergency VistA Patch (MHV*1.0*29) will address 
 the following:
  
 1. JAZZ 386781:Defect (Prod): Space / Special characters in Clinician's
 last name or first name in VistA New Person File preventing SM Clinician 
 login.
  
 2. JAZZ 390964:Defect: SM - Messages for users with a blank in first name 
 cannot be saved to CPRS.
  
 3. JAZZ 409966:Story: SM - VistA Patch MHV*1*29 - ENHANCE SM USER QUERY:
 Add Middle name and other identified attributes (Suffix, Prefix, Title, 
 Phone Number, DISUSER flag, PROVIDER Class, Person Class, Divisions, 
 Service/Section, Specialty, Requires Cosigner flag). 
 Additional Integration Agreement (ICR) MHV package subscribed to:
 ICR#2533 to extract PROVIDER DIVISIONS.
  
 4. JAZZ 504782:Defect: SM VistA Patch 29- PCMM Flag field displaying
