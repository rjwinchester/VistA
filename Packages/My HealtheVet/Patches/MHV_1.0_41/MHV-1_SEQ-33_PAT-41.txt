 Veteran Facing Enhancements (VFE) Team Enhancements (NATIONAL RELEASE):
 ================================================================
 
 MHV ADMIN PORTAL ENHANCEMENTS
  JAZZ 904828 Create new Help File link for User Profile portlet in MHV Admin
              Portal
 
 SM ADMIN PORTAL ENHANCEMENTS
  JAZZ 772027 SM Admin Redesign -SM Admin redesign will move the Secure Messaging
              functionality from the Legacy system to the modern, Technical 
              Reference Model (TRM) compliant Liferay Content Management System.
              The SM redesign effort is the first in a series of efforts to
              bring MHV in compliance with the evolving TRM standards and 
              modernization of the User Interface experience. SM Redesign will 
              also be the first portion of My HealtheVet's transition in to a 
              containerized service, which will serve the purpose of 
              accommodating our goals of: highly flexible scalability; simpler 
              and faster deployments to agnostic production platforms; and 
              increased control over provisioning of application resources to 
              maximize application efficiency. 
 
 SM ADMIN PORTAL ENHANCEMENTS/DEFECTS
  JAZZ 900776 UAT (PROD): Comments added in new line when a user is
              automatically terminated due to inactivity or termination date

  JAZZ 918181 Clean-up the unused SMAS_PORTLET, ADMIN_Portal_WS 
              Component_Properties:  Deleted some of the unused properties from
              the database as these properties are no longer required to be on
              database table or application code. These properties were 
              originally created for SM patient legacy application, we migrated
              SM Patient legacy application to MHV national portal, so these 
              properties are outdated/not actively being 
              used. (Non-Veteran Facing)
