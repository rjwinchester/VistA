BACKGROUND:
 
Patch PRC*5.1*191  replaced patch  PRC*5.1*89  which has  been  marked as
entered in error  patch PRC*5.1*189 on 6/29/15.   Forum message #73546428
instructed  sites to back out patch PRC*5.1*189 and restore their systems
to the pre-patch routines.
 
Routine Name: PRCHMA2  -- B22333129 (Post 189 Value: B26609094)
Routine Name: PRCHNPO1 -- B54494630 (Post 189 Value: B57588246)
Routine Name: PRCHNPOC -- n/a; new  (Post 189 Value: B1332156)
Routine Name: PRCHREC  -- B41539701 (Post 189 Value: B47786869)
Routine Name: PRCSUT3  -- B17626422 (Post 189 Value: B32178363)

Patch PRC*5.1*191 is the replacement patch for PRC*5.1*189.
 
The pre-checksums for patch 191  unfortunately reflect those post install 
of patch PRC*5.1*189 as  the Patch Module  in Forum still contained those
values rather than the restored values when sites were instructed to back
out patch PRC*5.1*189.
