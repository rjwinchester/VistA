 Patch Components
 ================
   
 The following describes each component of the BCR Patch 2.0*1
  
 180506: Deploy Breast Care Registry (BCR) to Production  
 Issue: BCR, formerly known as Breast Cancer Clinical Case Registry 
 (BCCCR), was established to provide a registry of information about
 breast cancer screening, test results, treatment, and follow-up for
 clinical care and population surveillance of breast care. The registry
 provides a user interface for clinicians and coordinators to analyze
 and report registry data.
  
 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Breast Care Registry (BCR),
 formerly known as Breast Cancer Clinical Case Registry (BCCCR), was
 established to provide a registry of information about breast cancer
 screening, test results, treatment, and follow-up for clinical care
 and population surveillance of breast care. The registry provides a
 user interface for clinicians and coordinators to analyze and report
 BCR patient health metrics and data. 
  
 BCR Version 2.0 enhances the existing BCR by completing the implementation
 of initial requirements; repairing legacy defects; ensuring report
 consistency; ensuring comprehensive data ingestion and accuracy from
 identified data sources; and deploying a fully functional national release
 of the registry.
  
 BCR v2.0 is a Web-based intranet registry application, residing within
 the Converged Registries Solution (CRS) architectural framework.
  
 The provider documents patient care encounters and enters the data into 
 the Computerized Patient Record System/Veterans Health Information Systems
 and Technology Architecture (CPRS/VistA).
  
 1) The patient data is securely stored in the Corporate Data Warehouse 
 (CDW). This CDW data is also compiled from feeds from corresponding
 Regional Data Warehouse (RDW) and Veterans Integrated Service Network
 (VISN) DataWarehouse (VDW) sources.
  
 2) At regular intervals, the BCR database (residing within CRS) extracts
 data specific to the breast care patient cohort from CDW. The BCR
 Dashboard provides BCR users with quality patient data, including patient
 details and standard, aggregate and ad hoc reports. Depending on user
 permissions, data is available at the national, regional and local levels,
 allowing providers to evaluate effective treatment, quality care,
 scheduling, and planning for their specific cohort.
  
 The enhanced BCR provides the Women's Health Services of the Veterans
 Health Administration (VHA) with the ability to determine areas of
 improvement for the timely and quality care of Veterans, and to
 enhance the VHA's capacity to monitor long-term outcomes of BCR
 patients within Women's Health Services.

 Training 
  
 Separate training sessions for IRM and users will be offered to each 
 facility in a series of Live Meeting conference calls on the VANTS 
 Bridge.

 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 =======================
 As a VA intranet Web site, BCR troubleshooting procedures will usually
 involve contacting the BCR network administrators or the NSD. Calls to
 the NSD should state that the user is working with the Converged
 Registries Solution and the Breast Care Registry. The NSD will then
 direct the trouble ticket to AITC, who will use established procedures
 to direct the problem to the CRS sustainment team.
