A patch has been entered in error for 'PAID'.
 
The patch is 'PRS*4*129' and the subject is 'PT SUN PREM PAY'.
 
Use the 'Display Patch' option for more details.

Entered in Error Description:
An issue has been found that part time employees (Title 38) that worked a
compressed tour on Sundays were getting Sunday Premium pay for the entire tour
and now they are only getting 8 hours. The patch should have only changed
Sunday Premium pay for PT Title 5 and Wage Grade employees.  

Action Plan: 
The sites have been instructed to NOT load this patch if they haven't done so. 
Sites that have installed this patch must back the patch out by restoring the
routines from the backup message.  This should be done BEFORE PP 14-23 time
cards are certified. 

Regarding the data change that was issued with the patch - the gold version of
the PAY ENTITLEMENT (#457.5) global will be forwarded to the sites via a
message that contains the data from before patch PRS*4.0*129 for sites to use
as a backup, since they would not have saved off the data when installing the
patch. 

If you have any questions, please log a REMEDY ticket and a member of the
Health Product Support Financial Systems Team will assist you.
       
A subsequent patch will be released to correct the Sunday Premium pay. VM SQA
and Development Manager will do a formal Root Cause Analysis of this 
situation and act accordingly.
