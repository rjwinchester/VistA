Patch 143 Overview

This document describes MAG*3.0*143, the patch that resolves the VistA Imaging Import OCX-Group Pointer Issue for the VistA Imaging (VI) Import Application Programming Interface (API).

The VI Import API is a utility created so applications, other than VI, can attach patient document/images to the patient record. The Import API has M routines that are installed on the VistA System and an ActiveX control that is installed on the Background Processor (BP) workstation.

Applications implement the Import API through a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to the VistA System. The RPC accepts an input array of data. Data are validated, and an Import Queue is created in the IMPORT QUEUE file (#2006.034). The BP processes the entries in the Import Queue, and during this process, the BP calls the methods of the Import OCX.  

The features and fixes of MAG*3.0*143 are summarized below:
* MAG*3.0*143 addresses the issue of invalid group pointers in the VistA IMAGE (#2005) file. The issue occurs when an application that implements the Import API attempts to import a group of images and attach the group to a Text Integration Utility (TIU) Note.

Previous patches that included changes to the Import OCX also have included the BP application. MAG*3.0*143 contains only the Import OCX ActiveX control: MagImportXControl1_143.ocx.

Note: 
After download and before installation, rename this file (MagImportXControl1_143.ocx.) to MagImportXControl1.ocx.  In this document all references to MagImportXControl1.ocx are referring to the renamed file.

Patch 143 Changes

Summary
When a group of images is imported through the Import API and attached to a TIU Note, the BP calls the Import OCX to process the import. During the process, an entry is made in the IMAGE (#2005) file for the group and for each image to be imported. The images are then copied to the Image Share. The last step in the process is to link the TIU Note to the Image Group. This link is made by the RPC MAG3 TIU IMAGE.
Issue
In Clinical Display, the user selects an Image Group to display. However, the images do not open, instead a warning dialog is shown, stating, “Questionable integrity: Missing parent image pointer.” Also, in the VistA System error trap, the error “ERROR=<SUBSCRIPT>FILE+7~MAGGNTI” is logged.
Problem
In this case, when a group entry is being linked to a TIU Image, the value of the group pointer that is sent as a parameter in the MAG3 TIU IMAGE RPC is null and the images are not linked to the TIU Note.
The pointer from IMAGE File (#2005) to TIU Document (#8925) doesn’t set. Also, the pointer from TIU EXTERNAL DATA LINK File (#8925.91) to IMAGE File (#2005) doesn’t set.
Solution
A change in Patch 135 import OCX inadvertently changed the parameter that was sent to the MAG3 TIU IMAGE RPC. The parameter that was sent was always null. The fix is to change the incorrect parameter to the correct parameter.  
Import OCX Changes
There is a modification to the Import OCX method to send the correct parameter in the RPC call that links the TIU Note to the Image Group. No other methods are modified. 
VistA System Changes

Install Completed

Import OCX Installation
The Import OCX software for this patch will be installed manually. The file MagImportXControl1.OCX needs to be installed and registered according to the instructions that follow. After the client installation is completed, log in to an updated workstation, then use the Help | About menu option to verify the version number is 30.50.143.1
Manual Installation 
Manually register the Import API OCX: MagImportXControl1.ocx:
1. Close the BP application (don't just "stop," but close the application).
2. To register the OCX, you need to run the Command prompt as an administrator (even if you have administrator privileges, you still need to select Run As Administrator).
3. Open the start menu and type "cmd" into the search box. 
4. Hold Ctrl + Shift and press Enter.

5. This runs the Command window in Administrator Mode.



6. Change directory to  c:\program files (x86)\vista\imaging\lib.
Unregister the current OCX:
 … \Lib>regsvr32 MagImportXControl1.ocx /u-.


7. Rename existing OCX as 135 version (not required) …\Lib>rename MagImportXControl1.ocx MagImportXControl1.135.ocx.
8. Rename the file : MagImportXControl1_143.ocx. to MagImportXControl1.ocx
Install the new Import API OCX Control MagImportXControl1.ocx  into the …\Lib directory. 

Register the new OCX:  …\Lib>regsvr32 MagImportXControl1.ocx.
9. You can now restart the BP application:a. OCX version numbers:
* The file version for the 135 OCX (old OCX) is 30.50.135.10.
* The file version for the 143 OCX (new OCX) is 30.50.143.1


There is an alternate way to run the Command prompt as an administrator:

1. Click the Start button, and choose > All Programs > Accessories. 
2. Right-click on Command prompt, select Run As Administrator. 


Possible error messages:

1. When registering the new OCX, this error message will be displayed if you are not running as an administrator.

2. If you get this error, try changing the directory to c:\program files (x86)\vista\imaging\lib and then try to register again. 


Uninstalling the Import OCX MAG*3.0*143
If necessary, uninstall the MAG*3.0*143 Import OCX by following these steps:
1. Uninstall the BP MAG*3.0*135, then reinstall it.
2. This will unregister the Import OCX from Patch 143 and will reinstall the Import OCX from Patch 135.
