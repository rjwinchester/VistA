HEADS UP ON LR*5.2*492   **** DO NOT INSTALL ****
 
There has been a problem identified with VistA patch LR*5.2*492.  After 
installing this patch, some sites have reported a problem with the Lab 
Collection List not building correctly.  The list gets "stuck" in the 
building state, and when trying to print the list, users see a message of 
"Collection list is STILL BUILDING."
 
If your site has recently installed LR*5.2*492 and are now experiencing 
random collection lists not building, please have your local/regional 
OI&T staff check your error trap.  If an error is seen in LRPHSET2 log a 
CA SDM ticket to NTL SUP CLIN2.   The error would like something like 
this:
 
<UNDEFINED>SCAN60^LRPHSET2
-       OR -
<UNDEFINED>LP+15^LRPHSET2
 
We are researching this with the developers and a work around is 
available. 
 
If your site has NOT installed LR*5.2*492, please do NOT install.  The 
current compliance date for this patch is December 14, 2017, but will 
most likely be extended depending on what our research finds.
