This document describes MAG*3.0*143, the patch that resolves the VistA 
Imaging Import OCX-Group Pointer Issue for the VistA Imaging (VI) Import 
Application Programming Interface (API).
 
The VI Import API is a utility created so applications, other than VI, 
can attach patient document/images to the patient record. The Import API 
has M routines that are installed on the VistA System and an ActiveX 
control that is installed on the Background Processor (BP) workstation.
 
Applications implement the Import API through a Remote Procedure Call 
(RPC) to the VistA System. The RPC accepts an input array of data. Data 
are validated, and an Import Queue is created in the IMPORT QUEUE file 
(#2006.034). The BP processes the entries in the Import Queue, and during 
this process, the BP calls the methods of the Import OCX.  
 
The features and fixes of MAG*3.0*143 are summarized below:
MAG*3.0*143 addresses the issue of invalid group pointers in the VistA
IMAGE (#2005) file. The issue occurs when an application that implements
the Import API attempts to import a group of images and attach the group
to a Text Integration Utility (TIU) Note.
 
Previous patches that included changes to the Import OCX also have 
included the BP application. MAG*3.0*143 contains only the Import OCX 
ActiveX control: MagImportXControl1_143.ocx.
 
Note: 
After download and before installation, rename this file 
(MagImportXControl1_143.ocx.) to MagImportXControl1.ocx.  In this 
document all references to MagImportXControl1.ocx are referring to the 
renamed file.
