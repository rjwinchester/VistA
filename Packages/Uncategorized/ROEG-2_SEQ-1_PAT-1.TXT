 Patch Components
 ================
   
 The following describes each component of the MSSR Patch 2.0*1
  
 268032: MSSRE: App enhancements 
 Issue: In response to Congressional legislation, Veteran's Health 
 Administration established two Multiple Sclerosis Centers of Excellence
 (MSCoE) in 2003.  These Centers (East and West) were subsequently made
 permanent by "The Veteran's Benefits, Healthcare and Information
 Technology Act of 2006."  The MSCoEs were mandated to report on the
 epidemiology, healthcare use, and costs of the Veteran Multiple Sclerosis
 (MS) population.  A VHA Handbook entitled Multiple Sclerosis System of
 Care Procedures 1011.06 was released to the field on December 7, 2009.  
 This approved Handbook (which includes reference to the Congressional
 Mandate for the MSCoE) established policy and procedure for healthcare
 services for patients with MS and requires ongoing surveillance of this
 patient population.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established
 the MSSR (Multiple Sclerosis Surveillance Registry) in 2013 to provide
 population-specific patient data required to ensure that quality health
 care services continues to be delivered in a timely manner. 
  
 In 2013, VA developed MSSR by collecting clinical utilization, 
 demographic, and epidemiologic data.  A front end portal was created 
 within the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) for the entry of data
 by clinicians, as well as a back end data storage capability.  The portal
 tool is triggered annually for any patient with an MS diagnosis and
 provides a user interface for data entry into the database. The tool
 prompts providers to enter standard demographic and clinical variables
 important for clinical, quality improvement, and research activities
 mandated by VHA (which can be found in Appendix C of the VHA Handbook,
 Multiple Sclerosis System of Care Procedures 1011.06). Data is stored
 centrally at the enterprise level.  The current effort will provide
 enhancements to MSSR by allowing front end user clinicians to input
 additional data entry points (e.g. patient death dates and causes on the
 Multiple Sclerosis Assessment Tool (MSAT)), automate data transmission on
 a regular schedule for the new patient data sources, creation of data
 population for the new patient data sources (e.g. utilization and type of
 prosthetics, pharmaceuticals, labs, radiology, fee based services) and
 reporting capabilities (e.g. prosthetics, pharmacy average cost per
 patient) for essential analysis.  The enhancements will enable the
 Multiple Sclerosis Centers of Excellence (MSCoE) to develop initiatives to
 improve healthcare for veterans with Multiple Sclerosis and related
 diseases, improve treatment triaging and outcomes, guide research and
 inform policy.
  
 MSSR Version 2.0 enhances the existing MSSR by completing the 
 implementation of initial requirements; ensuring report consistency;
 ensuring comprehensive data ingestion and accuracy from identified data
 sources; and deploying a fully functional national release of the
 registry.
  
 MSSR v2.0 is a Web-based intranet registry application, residing within
 the Converged Registries Solution (CRS) architectural framework. The
 provider documents MS assessment and enters the data into the Computerized
 Patient Record System/Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology
 Architecture (CPRS/VistA).
  
 1) The patient data is securely stored in the Corporate Data Warehouse
 (CDW). This CDW data is also compiled from feeds from corresponding
 Regional Data Warehouse (RDW) and Veterans Integrated Service Network
 (VISN) DataWarehouse (VDW) sources.
  
 2) At regular intervals, the MSSR database (residing within CRS) extracts
 data specific to the Multiple Sclerosis patient cohort from CDW. The MSSR
 Dashboard provides MSSR users with quality patient data, including patient
 details and standard and aggregate. Depending on user permissions, data is
 available at the national, regional and local levels, allowing providers
 to evaluate effective treatment, quality care, scheduling, and planning
 for patients.
  
 The enhanced MSSR provides users the ability to view detailed information
 regarding Pharmacy, prosthetics, Lab, radiology and Fee-based services
 provided to MS patients and help determine areas of improvement for the
 timely and quality care of Veterans, and to enhance the VHA's capacity to
 monitor long-term outcomes of MS patients identified by custom algorithm.

 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
  
 As a VA intranet Web site, MSSR troubleshooting procedures will usually
 involve contacting the MSSR network administrators or the NSD. Calls to
 the NSD should state that the user is working with the Converged
 Registries Solution and the Multiple Sclerosis Registry. The NSD will then
 direct the trouble ticket to AITC, who will use established procedures to
 direct the problem to the CRS sustainment team.
