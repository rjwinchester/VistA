 Patch Components
 ================
   
 The following describes each component of the VA EIDS Patch 2.0*1
  
 199354: VAEIDS Deploy Eye Injury Data Store to Production
 Issue: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the VA EIDS
 (formerly the Military Eye Injury Registry, or MEVIR) in 2012 to
 transfer Veteran eye injury data into the Defense and Veterans Eye
 Injury and Vision Registry (DVEIVR). The Department of Defense (DoD)
 developed DVEIVR in 2011 as the first ocular registry designed to be
 shared by VA and DoD.  VA EIDS is currently the primary data source of
 ocular and related data for Veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom,
 Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) being
 treated in VA medical and rehabilitation facilities. The VA EIDS
 collects and analyzes information from the Corporate Data Warehouse
 (CDW), which includes Veterans' clinical data regarding ocular and
 related diagnoses, medical and surgical interventions, other
 treatments, rehabilitation and restoration outcomes. The current
 effort will provide enhancements to VA EIDS to better support the
 harmonization of data between VA and DoD and to enhance data entry by
 data abstractors. The improvements will ensure that the same data
 format is used by DoD and VA. The improvements will also support
 eligibility determinations in relevant encounters, add new data fields
 (e.g., low vision and blind rehabilitation care), automate data
 transmission on a regular schedule, add the ability to filter records,
 and support accuracy in system reporting, which is essential for
 statistical results. The enhancements will enable the DoD/VA Vision
 Center of Excellence (VCE) to develop initiatives to improve visual
 readiness, enhance treatments and outcomes, guide research, establish
 guidelines for care, and inform policy. 
  
 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
 =======================
 As a VA intranet Web site, VA EIDS troubleshooting procedures will
 usually involve contacting the VA EIDS network administrators or the
 National Service Desk (NSD) by calling 1-855-NSD-HELP (1-855-673-4357). 
 Calls to the NSD should state that the user is working with the
 Converged Registries Solution (CRS) and the VA Eye Injury Data Store. The
 NSD will then direct the trouble ticket to AITC, who will use
 established procedures to direct the problem to the CRS sustainment
 team.
