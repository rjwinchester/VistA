Subject: REMOVE DELETE ALERTS OVER 14 DAYS OPTION FROM ALERT MANAGEMENT MENU

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Recently Health Systems Platform has seen an increase in sites 
 accidently running the Delete Old (>14 d) Alerts [XQALERT DELETE OLD] 
 option.  
  
 The Delete Old (>14 d) Alerts [XQALERT DELETE OLD] 
 resides on the Alert Management [XQALERT MGR] menu and is
 used to remove Alerts which remain in the User file after a period of
 at least two weeks.  It is assumed that if a user has not either
 seen or performed an action associated with an alert for this
 period, that it cannot be an urgent item for the user. 
  
 The Delete Old (>14 d) Alerts option [XQALERT DELETE OLD]
 purges unprocessed alerts from the ALERT file (#8992) and
 forwards required alerts to backup reviewers, supervisors
 or surrogates. It also purges alert tracking information from the
 ALERT TRACKING file (#8992.1).
  
 This option can be run either directly or as a queued nightly job.
 If the user queues the option, a retention period other than
 the 14-day default can be specified which overrides the alert
 retention value of 14 days.  Running it directly, will use the
 14 day default and can mistakenly cause thousands of alerts
 to be deleted from the system. 
  
 This Informational patch will resolve the issue by removing
 the Delete Old (>14 d) Alerts [XQALERT DELETE OLD] option
 from the Alert Management [XQALERT MGR] menu so the
 option will not be accidentally run and delete alerts from the system.
  
 Currently the Alert Management Menu contains the
 Delete Old (>14 d) Alerts option.
