Subject: Error resolution for DEGREE field INPUT TRANSFORM in files #20 & #200

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 Patch XU*8.0*703 corrects issues found in patch XU*8.0*679 and 
 reported in tickets INC2380289 and INC2422028. To resolve these issues,
 the DEGREE field (#6) in the NAME COMPONENTS file (#20) and the DEGREE
 field (#10.6) in the NEW PERSON file (#200) were modified. To resolve
 INC2380289, an INPUT TRANSFORM correction was made to allow direct entry
 of Degree codes in the NAME COMPONENTS file (#20). To resolve INC2422028,
 an INPUT TRANSFORM test was added to check for multiple spaces entered
 between Degree codes. The INPUT TRANSFORM also checks for leading or
 trailing spaces. If multiple spaces are found between codes, or if spaces
 are found at the beginning or end of the entry, then the entry is
 rejected. The Help text now indicates that only one space is allowed
 between codes, with no leading or trailing spaces.
  
 This patch also modifies routine XUSESIG3 to prevent entry of duplicate 
 degrees in the NAME COMPONENTS file (#20)and the NEW PERSON file (#200).

 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 INC2380289 - The degree field in the NAME COMPONENTS file (#20) does not 
 accept valid additions.
  
 INC2422028 - Using more than one space as a delimiter between Degree codes
 causes subscript errors.
  
 Problem:
 -------
 INC2380289 reported that the DEGREE field (#6) in the NAME COMPONENTS 
 file (#20) would not accept valid entries. This was caused by the use of 
 $D in a test for an existing entry in the EDUCATION file. 
  
 INC2422028 reported subscript errors when more than one space was used as 
 a delimiter between Degree codes.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 INC2380289 was resolved by changing $D to '$D in the INPUT TRANSFORM for 
 the NAME COMPONENTS file (#20). 
  
 INC2422028 was resolved by adding !(X["  ") as a third condition at the 
 beginning of the INPUT TRANSFORM to reject any entry that includes 
 multiple spaces as a delimiter between Degree codes. Help text now 
 indicates that only one space is allowed between codes.

 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users. This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
 Note: This patch was designed for standard Class I production 
 environments. Any local modifications or cross-references to the DEGREE 
 field in the NEW PERSON file (#200), the NAME COMPONENTS file (#20), or 
 the EDUCATION file (#20.11) should be disabled or removed prior to 
 installation.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------

 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of this patch, it is not recommended for 
 backout, and a restore from a backup of the Transport Global should not 
 be attempted. However, in the event that a site decides to back out this 
 patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit 
 a help desk ticket. The development team will need to issue one or more 
 follow-up patches in order to comprehensively back out this patch, after 
 coordination with the VA Project Manager and COR.
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the XU routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the XU routines have been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain 
 the designation of patch XU*8.0*703 on line 2 in the patch list section. 
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out; it does not confirm that other patch component changes 
 have been backed out.

Routine Information:
====================
The second line of each of these routines now looks like:
 ;;8.0;KERNEL;**[Patch List]**;02/02/17;Build 35

The checksums below are new checksums, and
 can be checked with CHECK1^XTSUMBLD.

Routine Name: XUSESIG3
