Description:

 Description:
 ===========
  
 Two related patches are being distributed in a single host file.  These
 patches provide a new Kernel utility, the Lock Manager.  It is based on 
 the Class 3 VistA Lock Manager developed by Tommy Martin. Both patches are
 listed below and will be installed in the order listed.
  
 XU*8.0*608      - This patch contains all the software components that 
                   make up the Kernel Lock Manager.
  
 XU*8.0*607      - This patch populates the new XULM LOCK DICTIONARY file
                   (#8993). It requires the KIDS enhancement patch
                   XU*8.0*672.
  
  
 The principal use of the Lock Manager is to assist the user in locating 
 locks whose process has become dissociated from an active user, and once
 located to kill the process that owns the lock, thereby releasing the
 locks held by that process.
  
 The advantages of this utility over the existing Cache utilities are:
   1) You can use the Lock Manager from within VistA.
   2) You will not need to log into multiple nodes, even if the process
      that holds the lock is on a different node than the one you currently
      logged onto.
   3) The Lock Manager has built-in VistA expertise, providing in-depth
      details about the locks, the files that the locks reference, and
      the processes that hold the locks.  The sources of the VistA
      expertise is the new XULM LOCK DICTIONARY file (#8993).
   4) The lock dictionary is extendible.  You can add information about
      locks not included in the initial release of the lock dictionary.  
      The new component, the XULM LOCK DICTIONARY ENTRY, added to KIDS by
      KIDS patch, XU*8.0*672, allowing application developers to add to the
      lock dictionary and distribute their additions via KIDS.

 New Housekeeping APIs:
 ======================
 When an application terminates, there may be housekeeping required.  A
 prime example is the need to delete temporary data kept in the ^TMP and
 ^XTMP globals.  An application that is terminated by the lock manager 
 won't have the opportunity to do its own cleanup, but the lock manager
 will do it for the application if it registered a cleanup routine via the
 new API described below.
  
  
 SETCLEAN^XULMU(RTN,.VAR)
   Description:  The purpose of this API is to register a cleanup
       routine that should be executed when the process is terminated
       by the Kernel Lock Manager.  An entry is created on a stack kept
       for the process.  The location is ^XTMP("XULM CLEANUP_"_$J) where
       $J uniquely identifies the process.  A process may call 
       SETCLEAN^XULMU repeatedly, and each time a new entry is placed on
       the stack.
  
   *Important*: Once an application calls SETCLEAN, upon exiting it must
        either execute its housecleaning stack or delete it, using 
        either the API CLEAN or UNCLEAN. 
  
    Input:
        RTN - The routine to be executed when the process is terminated.
  
        VAR - A list of variables that should be defined when the
            routine is executed.  It is up to the application to insure
            that all the required variables are defined.
    Output:
            Function return value - An integer is returned that identifies
            the entry created on the stack.  The application needs to 
            retain the value in order to either execute the entry
            on the housecleaning stack or to remove it.
  
    Example:  
            Suppose the application has a cleanup routine CLEANUP^XXAPP,
            and it needs to be executed with DUZ defined with its present
            value.  The application would use this API as follows:
  
                    N VAR,CLEANUP
                    S VAR("DUZ")=DUZ
                    S CLEANUP=$$SETCLEAN^XULMU("CLEANUP^XXAPP",.VAR)
  
            The application's housekeeping stack would look like this:
  
            ^XTMP("XULM CLEANUP",$J,1,"ROUTINE")="CLEANUP^XXAPP"
            ^XTMP("XULM CLEANUP",$J,1,"VARIABLES","DUZ")=1000061
  
 UNCLEAN^XULMU(LAST)
   Description - this removes entries from the housecleaning stack set by
       calling SETCLEAN^XULMU. Entries are removed in FIFO order.  If LAST 
       is not passed in, then the entire stack is deleted, otherwise just
       the entries back to LAST are removed.
  
   Input:
       LAST - Identifies the last entry on the housekeeping stack to 
              remove. Entries are removed in FIFO order, so the first entry
              removed is the last entry that was added, and the last entry
              removed is LAST. If not passed in, the entire housecleaning
              stack is deleted.
  
     Output: none
  
     Example: This would remove the entire housecleaning stack: 
  
                     DO UNCLEAN^XULMU
  
     Example: If an application is called by another application, then the
              the first application may have already placed entries of its
              own on the stack.   So the parameter LAST needs to be passed,
              with LAST being the first entry placed on the stack.  It will
              be the last entry deleted, since that stack is executed in 
              FIFO order.
  
  
               DO UNCLEAN^XULMU(LAST)
  
  
  
  
 CLEANUP^XULMU(LAST)
  
   Description:  This API will execute the housecleaning stack set by the
       process identified by DOLLARJ. Entries are executed in the FIFO
       order, with the last entry added being the first to be executed, and
       LAST being the last entry executed. If LAST is not passed in, then
       the entire stack is executed.
  
    Input:
              XULAST (optional) - This is the last entry that will be
              executed. If not passed in, then the entire housecleaning
              stack is executed.
  
    Output: none
  
    Example:  An application may execute the entire housecleaning stack
              with the following code:
  
               DO CLEANUP^XULMU
  
    Example:  If an application is called by another application, then the
              the first application may have already placed entries of its
              own on the stack.  So the parameter LAST needs to be passed,
              with LAST being the first entry placed on the stack.  It will
              be the last entry executed, since that stack is executed in 
              FIFO order.
  
               DO CLEANUP^XULM(LAST)

 Protocols Associated:
 ====================
   XULM DISPLAY SYSTEM LOCKS
     This List Template action protocol displays a list of the system
     locks.  System locks are generally ignored within the Lock Manager.
     They are locks held by infrastructure packages, such as the Kernel
     or HL7 package.  
  
   XULM LOCK MANAGER MENU
     This is the protocol menu for the Kernel Lock Manager List Manager
     screen.  
  
   XULM REFRESH LOCKS
     This List Manager action protocol re-builds the list of locks by
     reading the lock table. 
  
   XULM SELECT LOCK
     This action allows a user to select a lock from the list.  It then
     displays a new screen with detailed information about the lock.      
  
   XULM GO TO
     This List Manager action asks the user where he wants to go to on the
     list and then shifts the display to that location.  
  
   XULM SORT/SCREEN LOCKS
     This action provides the user with several options for how the list 
     locks should be displayed.  The options include sorting the list by
     patient name, sorting the list by the user name, sorting the list by
     the lock string, or screening the entries by lock reference, which
     means that only locks that relate to a specific file will be included
     in the display. 
  
   XULM SELECT NODE
     This action allows the user to select either a single computer node or
     all the computer nodes.  If the user selects a single node then the
     display of locks will include only locks placed by processes running
     on that node.   
  
   XULM SINGLE LOCK MENU
     This is the protocol menu for the XULM DISPLAY SINGLE LOCK List

 Cache Install/Update scripts Include %ZLMLIB
 ============================================
  
 The routine %ZLMLIB is essential to the proper functioning of the Kernel 
 Lock Manager, to address the issue of requiring elevated privileges to 
 save the %ZLMLIB routine in CACHESYS, HSP has proposed including the 
 %ZLMLIB routine as part of their Cache Install and Upgrade scripts for 
 Linux and VMS platforms. This also addresses the issue of the %ZLMLIB 
 routine being deleted upon a Cache upgrade. HSP has already acted on this 
 proposal by including %ZLMLIB routine for the Cache Install and Upgrade 
 scripts for both Linux and VMS platforms.
  
   
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ==============================
 The Post-Installation routine for patch XU*8.0*608 populates the LOCK 
 MANAGER PARAMETERS file (#8993.1)
  
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
 There are no options that need be disabled.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 =============================
  - Users may remain on the system.
  - Make sure no other patch is being installed at the same time.
  - TaskMan does *not* need to be stopped or put in wait state. 
  - This installation can be queued.
  - Installation should take less than 2 minutes.
  
 1. Obtain the host file via SFTP from one of the sites listed above 
    and place it on your system.  The host file contains these patches:
  
    XU*8.0*608
    XU*8.0*607
  
  
 2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
    the Installation Menu. Then select the Load a Distribution option.
  
    You will be prompted to enter the name of the host file.  Enter
    the full name, including the directory.  
  
    KIDS will load both patches from the host file.
  
  
 3. From the Installation Menu, you may elect to use the
    following option. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch # 
    XU*8.0*608.  This install contains the two patches listed above.
  
    a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
        message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
        backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
    b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
        is installed.  It compares all components of this patch

 Post-Installation Instructions
 ==============================
  
 These steps are needed to complete the installation:
  
  
 1) Site parameters must be entered using the option XULM EDIT PARAMETERS
    [EDIT LOCK MANAGER PARAMETERS] located on the XUSITEMGR menu option
    [Operations Management].  This needs to be done for both the test 
    account and the production account.
  
    Using this option:
  
    A. Set the APPLICATION STATUS to ENABLED.
    B. For each node in the system configuration, do the following:
       a. At the "Select NODES:" prompt, enter the name of the node.  The 
       name can be obtained by logging onto the node and entering at the
       MUMPS prompt:   W ##class(%SYS.System).GetInstanceName()
  
          The instance name is returned.   
  
          In this example the instance is named ISFKDASVR.
  
          
 Example:
          W ##class(%SYS.System).GetInstanceName()
          ISFKDASVR  <-- Instance name is returned
          
  
       Note: If the instance name is entered incorrectly, or later it 
       changes, the Lock Manager will automatically correct it the next
       time it is used to display the lock table. It does this by
       node, using the IP address and port for that node, to query that 
       node for its instance name.
  
       b. At the 'TCP/IP ADDRESS' prompt, enter the IP address.
  
       c. At the 'BROKER PORT' prompt, enter the port number of the Broker
          running on that port.  Either the RPC Broker port or the M-to-M 
          port can be used, but the RPC Broker port is recommended and is
          more widely available.
  
       d. The 'SHORT DISPLAY NAME' prompt is optional.  If the node's name 
          is over 8 characters, it is necessary at times to display a
          shortened version.  The default is to display only the last 8
          characters. If the result isn't satisfactory, you may enter a
          shortened name for the node to use as an alternative.  This
          pertains especially to Linux systems.
  
  
 2) For each user that needs access to the Lock Manager:
    A. Assign the user the XULM LOCKS security key.
    B. Assign the user the XULM RPC BROKER CONTEXT option, which is the
       context option used by the RPC broker for the Lock Manager when 
       making remote procedure calls.
