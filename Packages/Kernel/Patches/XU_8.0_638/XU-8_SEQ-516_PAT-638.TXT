Description:
============

 This patch is one in a series of patches to support the VA's transition 
 from IPv4 to IPv6.  IPv6 is a protocol designed to handle the growth rate 
 of the Internet and to cope with the demanding requirements of services,
 mobility, and end-to-end security.  A Federal Chief Information Office 
 (CIO) memo "Transition to IPv6" released in September of 2010 requires
 agencies to continue their IPv6 transition efforts and has established
 specific milestones associated with enabling an IPv6 operational
 capability by the end of FY2014.  A waiver request to extend the deadline 
 has been submitted.
  
 This patch updates routines where IPv4 address formats were hard-coded.
 These have been replaced with calls to IPv4/IPv6 Application Programmer
 Interfaces (APIs). Minor changes have also been made in algorithms to
 improve the efficiency of IP address handling.
  
 Summary of changes and completed testing: 
    1.  IPv6 login via Attachmate Telnet successfully completed in a test 
        environment (not yet available in VHA production).
    2.  IPv6 login with Attachmate SSL successfully completed in a test 
        environment (not yet available in VHA production).
    3.  Fixed API in ^XLFIPV to properly convert between IPv4 null address 
        '0.0.0.0' and IPv6 null address '::0'.
    4.  Fixed API in ^XLFIPV to properly convert between IPv4 loopback  
        address '127.0.0.1' and IPv6 loopback address '::1'.
    5.  Changed SIGN-ON LOG file (#3.081) data dictionary IP ADDRESS field
        (#11) name to IPV4 ADDRESS.
    6.  Changed SIGN-ON LOG file (#3.081) data dictionary to add new field
        IPV6 ADDRESS.
    7.  Fixed ^XUS1 routine where Kernel sets the IP Address in the SIGN-ON
        LOG file (#3.081) to use new APIs.
    8.  Changed ^XUS1A and ^XUS1B routines to use new IPv6 cross-references
        for Single Sign-On and Multi-Sign-On Control. Also made changes to
        nightly clean-up to remove new cross-references for sessions that
        terminated abnormally.
    9.  Fixed ^%Z* routines that had hard-coded IPv4 address formats.
    10. Fixed ^%ZISTCP routine to use IPv4 or IPv6 address when 
        originating a connection to another server.
    11. Added the ability to look up DNS IPv6 addresses by specifying 
        "AAAA" as an input parameter in Kernel API $$ADDRESS^XLFNSLK() (IA
        #3056).
    12. Fixed two Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) that have never had the 
        AVAILABILITY field (#.05) or DESCRIPTION field (#1) populated
        properly.
    13. NOTE: VistA still requires that the DNS server IP address stored in
        the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS file (#8989.3) DNS IP field (#51) be
        stored as an IPv4 address. In other words, VistA will only do 
        IP address lookups to a DNS server at an IPv4 address, although the
        returned values may contain IPv6 information. Lookups to a DNS
        server at an IPv6 address will be addressed in a future patch.

 ============================
 Clearance - 07/08/14
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch XU*8.0*638 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in ProPath standard titled BBM Team 
 Review of VistA Patches. This patch does not alter or modify any VistA
 Blood Bank software design safeguards or safety critical elements
 functions.
   
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch XU*8.0*638 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 XUS GET VISITOR        SINGLE VALUE       MODIFIED
 (Added description and set availability to 'SUBSCRIPTION' as these fields 
 were not populated in VistA). This controlled-subscription RPC is used by 
 the Broker Security Enhancement to check a user's credentials based on a 
 BSE TOKEN that was passed to identify and authenticate a visiting user. 
 The remote VistA system calls this RPC on the authenticating VistA system 
 to validate if the visiting user is permitted to visit, and if so, obtain 
 the authenticated user's demographics.
  
 XUS SET VISITOR        SINGLE VALUE       MODIFIED
 (Added description and set availability to 'SUBSCRIPTION' as these fields 
 were not populated in VistA). This controlled-subscription RPC is used by 
 the Broker Security Enhancement on an authenticating VistA system to 
 obtain a BSE TOKEN for an authenticated active user. The TOKEN is used to 
 identify and authenticate a visiting user on a remote VistA system, which 
 calls back to the authenticating system to obtain the authenticated 
 user's demographics.

  INC000000063257 LIT-1201-71650 Select Division Lookup is Peculiar
  INC000000707869 Several BSE Errors in Error Trap
  INC000000739035 Kernel Support for IPv6
  
 1. INC000000063257 LIT-1201-71650 Select Division Lookup is Peculiar
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The "Select DIVISION:" prompt that appears during VistA login for 
 multi-division users are not always given the appropriate division 
 choices when a single letter followed by <CR> is entered at the prompt. 
 Multiple characters need to be typed to display all of the division 
 choices.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The FileMan Application Programmer Interface (API) used to lookup entries
 was assigned an extra parameter. Removal of this parameter provides the
 correct prompt.
  
 2. INC000000707869 Several BSE Errors in Error Trap
  
 Problem:
 -------
 A number of sites have reported BSE LOGIN ERROR entries in the error trap 
 after the installation of patch XU*8.0*595.  These errors were reviewed 
 by national help desk and by developers and many of the errors were found 
 to be normal Broker Security Enhancement processes.  They did not impact 
 the ability of users to log in.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Additional error screens have been added to routine XUSBSE1 to stop 
 recording errors which do not add value to the troubleshooting process.
  
 3. INC000000739035 Kernel Support for IPv6
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Currently, all of VA's internal and external infrastructure and 
 applications are set to IPv4 as the default transport mode.  The format 
 is different between IPv4 and IPv6.  Kernel and several other 
 applications process IP addresses in routines and need to store the IP 
 addresses in files.  Each of these fields will need to change their field 
 definition (data dictionary) to handle the longer IPv6 format.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This patch uses Kernel APIs introduced in XU*8.0*605 to replace 
 hard-coded IPv4 address handling in several routines.
