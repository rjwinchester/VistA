 Enhancement #2
 The existing RPC [XUS MVI NEW PERSON UPDATE] and corresponding routine
 XUMVINPU have been modified to allow the following additional fields to
 be updated by MVI in the NEW PERSON File (#200) for a specific DUZ:
  
       - EMAIL ADDRESS (#.151)
       - NETWORK USERNAME (#501.1)
  
 Enhancement #3
 A new RPC [XUS MVI ENRICH NEW PERSON] along with the corresponding
 routines XUMVIENU and XUMVINPA were created to give MVI the ability
 to 'Add' and/or 'Update' a NEW PERSON (#200) file entry in support of
 PPMS/PIE in VistA. This RPC 'REQUIRES' the following two parameters:
  
       - XUARR  - An array containing the new values for the specific
                  fields to 'ADD' or 'UPDATE' the record in the NEW

 execution completion:

 Enhancement #4
 The business office has requested that the [XUS MVI NEW PERSON DATA] RPC
 which returns calculated data analysis from the NEW PERSON (#200) file be
 enhanced to ensure that for a NEW PERSON (#200) record to be determined
 'Active' that the record must also have a PRIMARY MENU OPTION (Field #201)
 assigned. Therefore, the associated routine XUMVIDTA has been modified to
 include this additional check of ensuring that a NEW PERSON (#200) record
 has a PRIMARY MENU OPTION (#201) when determining if that user's record is
 considered 'Active'.

 Back-Out Plan
 -------------
 The back-out procedure for this patch would consist of restoring the
 RPCs [XUS MVI NEW PERSON GET] and [XUS MVI NEW PERSON UPDATE] and
 routine XUMVINPU, which can be accomplished by re-installing the KERNEL
 patch XU*8.0*691 again. In addition, routine XUMVIDTA should be restored
 using the back-up message created during the patch installation. Finally,
 the RPC [XUS MVI ENRICH NEW PERSON] in the REMOTE PROCEDURE (#8994) file
 and routines XUMVIENU and XUMVINPA should be deleted from the system.
    
 If assistance is still required to back-out the patch please contact the
 National Service Desk (NSD) to log a help desk ticket so the development
 team can assist in the process.
   
      Note: This process should only be done with the concurrence and
            participation of the development team and the appropriate
            VA Site/Region personnel.
