  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 XU*8.0*343 and XU*8.0*711 are the required builds for patch XU*8.0*710.
  
 The following enhancements exported in this patch are in support of
 the Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) that the Master
 Veteran Index (MVI) team has implemented to assist with the transition
 as sites move to the CERNER application. The enhancements listed below
 work in conjunction with the MVI changes that have been exported in
 patch MPI*1.0*129.
  
 Enhancement #1  
 A new restricted Remote Procedure Call (RPC) [XUS MVI NEW PERSON BULK
 GET] has been created to allow the MVI system to remotely retrieve
 delimited attribute information for 'ACTIVE' record entries from the
 NEW PERSON (#200) file. MVI will then export these returned results
 for a specific site to a flat file, which will then be imported by the
 Person Service Identity Management (PSIM) system so that the entries
 can be evaluated further.  
  
   NEW PERSON Attributes: 
   ---------------------
      - Internal Entry Number
      - NAME (#.01)
      - Address
           STREET ADDRESS 1 (#.111)
           STREET ADDRESS 2 (#.112)
           STREET ADDRESS 3 (#.113)
           CITY (#.114)
           STATE (#.115)
           ZIP CODE (#.116)
      - OFFICE PHONE (#.132)
      - EMAIL ADDRESS (#.151)
      - SEX (#4)
      - DOB (#5)
      - SSN (#9)
      - NAME COMPONENTS (#10.1) [*Pointer to NAME COMPONENTS (#20) file]
           FAMILY (LAST) NAME (#1)   
           GIVEN (FIRST) NAME (#2)
           MIDDLE NAME (#3)
           PREFIX (#4)
           SUFFIX (#5)
           DEGREE (#6)
      - DIVISION (#16) [*Multiple entries possible]
      - NPI (#41.99)
      - KEYS (#51) [*Multiple entries possible]
      - DEA# (#53.2)
      - PRIMARY MENU OPTION (#201)
      - SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS (#203) [*Multiple entries possible]
      - SUBJECT ORGANIZATION (#205.2)
      - SUBJECT ORGANIZATION ID (#205.3)
      - UNIQUE USER ID (#205.4)
      - NETWORK USERNAME (#501.1)
      - DEA EXPIRATION DATE (#747.44)
  
   Note: NEW PERSON (#200) file records are determined to be 'ACTIVE'
         for this RPC when the following 3 statements are ALL verified
         as 'TRUE':
          1. NOT Disuser'd
          2. NOT Terminated
          3. Has a Primary Menu Option assigned
   
 Enhancement #2
 The existing RPC [XUS MVI NEW PERSON UPDATE] and corresponding routine
 XUMVINPU have been modified to allow the NPI (National Provider
 Identifier) field (#41.99) in the NEW PERSON (#200) file to be updated
 remotely by MVI for a specific user entry. In addition, the FileMan (FM)
 filer call FILE^DIE in routine XUMVINPU has been modified to set the
 optional 'FLAGS' property to "E", to ensure that values entered are
 validated through the field Input Transforms if they exist.
    
 Issue #1
 To ensure that both 'Active' and 'Visitor' NEW PERSON (#200) file
 records are counted independently when the [XUS MVI NEW PERSON DATA]
 RPC is called by MVI, routine XUMVIDTA was modified to remove the QUIT
 statement after the 'Visitor' record has been tallied to allow other
 additional counts (ie. 'Active') to be processed if they apply, as it
 is possible to have both an 'Active' and 'Visitor' entry at sites. 
   
 Issue #2
 Upon release of patch XU*8.0*343, the Name Standardization process in
 routine XLFNAME2 was modified and introduced an unknown defect where 
 the maximum length of the source field being edited was replaced with a
 hard-coded value of 35, which has allowed for the creation/storage of
 names in the PATIENT file (#2) that are greater than the data definition
 of 30-characters. Therefore, routine XLFNAME2 was updated to revert back
 to using the data defined length of the source field or the passed in
 character limit as long as it doesn't exceed the data defined length,
 instead of the hard-coded 35-character limit.

 INC6745453 - Emergency Department Information System (EDIS) Name
              Component Issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the name fields in the NAME COMPONENTS file (#20) are edited,
 it is possible that the full name built from those components could 
 exceed 30 characters in length, and up to 35 characters could then be
 stored in the NAME field (#.01) of the PATIENT file (#2) even though
 the data definition of that field only allows for a maximum of 
 30-characters. This is due to an issue in the Name Standardization
 process that was updated and released in patch XU*8.0*343 when the
 field length was set to a hard-coded value of 35-characters.
  
 Note: The Name Standardization process also updates the NEW PERSON file
       (#200), but the NAME (#.01) value there allows for 35-characters
       to be entered.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine XLFNAME2 was modified to revert back to using the data defined
 length of the source field being updated or the routine parameter that
 is passed in defining the requested character limit to use as long as
 it doesn't exceed the data defined length, else the data defined length
 of the source field will be used in determining how many characters to
 store in the field.

 Back-Out Plan
 -------------
 The back-out procedure for this patch would consist of executing all
 of the following processes below:
    
      1. Restoring the original routine XLFNAME2 using the back-up
         message created during the patch installation.
      2. Restoring the RPC [XUS MVI NEW PERSON UPDATE] and routine
         XUMVINPU, which can be accomplished by re-installing the
         KERNEL patch XU*8.0*711 again.
      3. Deleting the new routine 'XUMVINPB' and also the new RPC
         [XUS MVI NEW PERSON BULK GET] (through FileMan (FM)) from
         the REMOTE PROCEDURE (#8994) file from the system.
      
 If assistance is still required to back-out the patch please contact the
 National Service Desk (NSD) to log a help desk ticket so the development
 team can assist in the process.
   
      Note: This process should only be done with the concurrence and
            participation of the development team and the appropriate
            VA Site/Region personnel.
