 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview
 -------------------------------------------
  
  INC0000000854377 DEA# Expiration Date Not Being Checked
  INC0000000894144 Infinite Loop
  (no number) Issues with the provider validation reports
  
 1. INC0000000854377 DEA# Expiration Date Not Being Checked
  
 Problem:
 -------
 VistA stores the facility/institutional DEA# and DEA EXPIRATION DATE in 
 fields 53.2 and 747.44 of the NEW PERSON file (#200), but the expiration 
 date for the facility DEA # is not checked when the provider's DEA# is
 invalid, but a VA # exists.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified the VA# validation in the API $$DEA^XUSER() to appropriately
 evaluate the facility DEA# expiration date, and return a null value
 instead of the DEA# when the DEA# is expired.
  
 2. INC0000000894144 Infinite Loop
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Tag HELO in XUSC1C fails to terminate if CREAD^XUSC1S does not return 
 data. The last loop will continue on forever (infinite loop) even if 
 there is an error trapped.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Added a loop counter in HELO^XUSC1C to break the loop if CREAD^XUSC1S 
 fails to return data. In addition, the hard coded string comparison of IP 
 addresses was replaced with the usage of a supported Application 
 Program Interface call.
  
 3. (no number) Issues with the provider validation reports
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The provider configuration reports were not accurately reporting the 
 providers whose DEA # was expired, but they had a VA # on file.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The API $$VDEA^XUSER was modified to return those users with no valid DEA
 number (none on file, or expired expiration date) and a valid VA number as
 valid DEA prescribers. The API was also changed to highlight those users
 who are grandfathered, since grandfathering will be removed at some point
 in the future.

 Implementation team. Installation instructions will be distributed when
 your site begins the implementation process.
  
 There were no Kernel documentation updates as a result of this patch. 
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at:
 http://www4.domain.ext/vdl/
  
 The updated documentation will not be on the vdl until after the phased
 deployment has completed.
  
 Patch Installation:
 =================== 
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.30.b Installation Guide" for installation 
 and set-up information. This document is exported as OR_30_350_IG.doc and
 OR_30_350_IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_350.ZIP and will be emailed to 
 the installation point of contacts by the CPRS Implementation team.
  
 Installation of these host files must be coordinated among the personnel 
 affected because these host files will be installed in one installation 
 session.
