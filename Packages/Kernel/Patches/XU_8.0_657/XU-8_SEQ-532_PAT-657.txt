Subject: SECURE HASH LIBRARY FUNCTIONS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 180-4 (FIPS PUB 
 180-4) specifies secure hash algorithms for computing a condensed 
 representation of electronic data (message). The hash algorithms 
 specified in this Standard are called secure because, for a given 
 algorithm, it is computationally infeasible 1) to find a message that 
 corresponds to a given message digest, or 2) to find two different 
 messages that produce the same message digest. Any change to a message 
 will, with a very high probability, result in a different message digest.
  
 SHA-256-384-512 algorithm is described in the NIST document:
  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/shs/sha256-384-512.pdf
  
 This routine provides new Kernel APIs for Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) 
 hashing of input of various formats. The first parameter, HASHLEN, is the 
 hash length in bits. It can have one of the following values:
   160 (SHA-1)
   224 (SHA-224)
   256 (SHA-256)
   384 (SHA-384)
   512 (SHA-512)
  
 $$FILE^XLFSHAN(HASHLEN,FILENUM,IEN,FIELD) - Return the SHA hash for the
                                      specified file entry.
  
 $$GLOBAL^XLFSHAN(,HASHLEN,FILENUM,DATAONLY)- Return the SHA hash for an
                                      entire global. If DATAONLY=1 the hash
                                      is computed only for the data. If
                                      DATAONLY=0 the data global location
                                      is included in the hash computation.
  
 $$HOSTFILE^XLFSHAN(HASHLEN,PATH,FILENAME) - Return the SHA hash for a host
                                      file.
  
 $$ROUTINE^XLFSHAN(HASHLEN,ROUTINE) - Return the SHA hash for a routine.
  
 $$SHAN^XLFSHAN(HASHLEN,MESSAGE)    - SHA hash for a message that can be
                                      passed as a single string.
  
 $$LSHAAN^XLFSHAN(HASHLEN,MSUB,NBLOCKS) - SHA hash for a message too long
                                      to be passed as a single string.
  
 In addition, this routine provides several new bitwise logic Math Library
 Functions and CPU time Functions:
  
 $$AND^XLFSHAN(X,Y)                 - Bitwise logical AND 32 bits.
  
 $$XOR^XLFSHAN(X,Y)                 - Bitwise logical XOR 32 bits.
  
 $$OR^XLFSHAN(X,Y)                  - Bitwise logical OR 32 bits.
  
 $$CPUTIME^XLFSHAN()                - Returns two comma-delimited pieces,
                                      "system" CPU time and "user" CPU time
                                      (except on VMS where no separate
                                      times are available). Time is
                                      returned as milliseconds of CPU time.
  
 $$ETIMEMS^XLFSHAN(START,END)       - Calculates and returns the elapsed
                                      time in milliseconds.
  
 A new supported Integration Control Registration (ICR) #6157 was created 
 for these library functions.

 1. I15173763FY17 Screenman variable to let you know the entry you are 
 editing has changed isn't working properly
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Screenman variable to let you know the entry you are editing has changed 
 isn't working properly.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 XU*8.0*657 fixes this by letting the code compute SHA HASH of the entry 
 before and after editing. If the HASH changes, the entry has changed.

 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 This patch can be queued for installation. TaskMan does not have to be
 stopped, HL7 filers do not need to be stopped, and users may be on the
 system.  There are no menu options or protocols that need to be disabled.
  
 Installation Instructions

 This patch may be installed with users on the system.  This patch should 
 take less than 1 minute to install.  It may be queued for installation.
  
 There are no options that need to be disabled.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following option. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch #(ex.
     XU*8.0*657):
  
     a.  Print Transport Global - This option lets you print the contents
         of a Transport Global that is currently loaded in the ^XTMP
         global.
     b.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch

     NO//' answer "NO".
  
 7.  If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//' answer "NO".
  
 8.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0//' answer "0" to 
     "60" or "Q" (to queue the output to a printer).
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 There are no post-installation tasks.
  
  
 Back out Instructions:
 ====================
  
    a.  Open the VistA MailMan message created during the "Backup a 
        Transport Global" step of the patch installation process (i.e.,
        Kernel and Kernel Toolkit Systems Management Guide, Section 23.7.8,
        "Backing Up Transport Globals").
    b.  Follow the installation sequence (i.e., Kernel and Kernel Toolkit
        Systems Management Guide, Section 23.7.1, "Installation Sequence")
        to load and install a patch from a PackMan message. This
        installation restores the original (pre-patch) VistA routine.
    c.  Because this is a new routine, the backup patch will only delete 
        the new routine. There is nothing old to restore.
