Description:
============

 VistA Kernel patch XU*8*630 provides the following security and bug fixes:
  
 1. On OpenVMS systems, 2-factor authentication sometimes fails when a
    Cache 2014.1 call to an operating system API to validate a digital 
    signature generates an error, even though the digital signature 
    processing completes as it should. The effect is that the error stack
    is "frozen", and a subsequent process that relies on a value in that
    stack erroneously errors out. This patch resets the error stack when
    this particular error occurs so that user authentication can continue.
  
 2. Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) is a joint VA and DoD graphical web based
    application that is used by both VA providers as well as DoD providers.
    The JLV web based application displays clinical information on a
    patient from VA and DoD sources.
    a. This patch enables Broker Security Enhancement (BSE) authentication
       for JLV by adding a "JLV BSE" entry in the REMOTE APPLICATION file
       (#8994.5). This entry will allow a user to authenticate with
       2-factor authentication in one VistA system (home), and visit 
       another VistA system (remote) using a BSE token. This is done in 
       accordance with instructions on the use of the Broker Security 
       Enhancement (BSE) as provided by RPC Broker software documentation.
       VistA Kernel is the custodian for the REMOTE APPLICATION file
       (#8994.5).
    b. This patch enhances 2-factor authentication into VistA to support
       non-VA users (Department of Defense and non-VA providers) accessing
       VistA through the JLV application using National Health Information
       Network (NHIN) Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) standards
       for user identification. A "JLV NHIN" entry is added to the REMOTE
       APPLICATION file (#8994.5) to provide role-based access and to
       identify JLV 2-factor authentication in the SIGN-ON LOG file
       (#3.081).
    c. A menu option "JLV GUI Menu Option" [JLV WEB SERVICES] is added to
       the OPTION file (#19) which contains the Remote Procedure Calls
       (RPCs) for the JLV application. This menu option will provide
       role-based access for BSE (item a, above) and 2-factor
       authentication (item b, above).
  
 3. The SIGN-ON LOG file (#3.081) includes a REMOTE APP field (#18) that
    contains a pointer to the REMOTE APPLICATION file (#8994.5). When a 
    user authenticates with BSE or with 2-factor authentication, this field
    is updated to show the client application if the application has a
    valid entry in the REMOTE APPLICATION file (#8994.5). This patch
    updates the print template for the Sign-On Log report to display this
    information.
  
 4. When the Identity and Access Management (IAM) "Link My Accounts" 
    application sends a request to VistA containing null data, an error is 
    trapped in VistA. The "Link My Accounts" application has already been 
    remediated to prevent sending null data, but this patch contains a fix
    on the VistA side that will prevent the error occurring should the
    problem be reintroduced in a future version of the application.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 INC000000831246 JLV - Security/Logon Issue
 I13662874FY17 <UNDEFINED>IAMBU+16^XUESSO4
  
 1. INC000000831246 JLV - Security/Logon Issue
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) uses a deprecated form of access to VistA 
 that does not securely authenticate or accurately identify the user
 accessing clinical records. This is a HIPAA violation that must be
 remediated using 2-factor authentication and unique identification of
 users.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This patch will create an entry in the REMOTE APPLICATION file (#8994.5) 
 for the JLV application. The Broker Security Enhancement (BSE) enables
 Remote Procedure Call (RPC) based applications to make remote user/visitor
 connections in a more secure manner.  BSE is used to authenticate a valid
 VistA user at one site (the home site) and subsequently access data and
 another site (the remote site).  BSE adds a step to the signon process to
 authenticate the connecting application.  This requires passing a secret
 encoded phrase that will be authenticated on the remote VistA system by
 looking up the entry in the REMOTE APPLICATION file (#8994.5).  The REMOTE
 APPLICATION file (#8994.5) is updated by Kernel patch and KIDS build.
  
 2. I13662874FY17 <UNDEFINED>IAMBU+16^XUESSO4
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When the Identity and Access Management (IAM) "Link My Accounts" 
 application calls the "XUS IAM BIND USER" RPC without passing the 
 required SECID parameter, VistA traps an <UNDEFINED> error.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine ^XUESSO4 was modified to return an error message to the "Link My 
 Accounts" application when a required parameter is missing, and no longer 
 trap an error in VistA.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 This patch can be queued for installation.  TaskMan does not have to be 
 stopped, HL7 filers do not need to be stopped, and users may be on the 
 system.  There are no menu options or protocols that need to be 
 disabled.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system. This patch should 
 take less than 1 minute to install. It may be queued for installation.
  
 There are no options that need to be disabled.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following option. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch #(ex.
     XU*8.0*630):
  
     a.  Print Transport Global - This option lets you print the contents
         of a Transport Global that is currently loaded in the ^XTMP
         global.
     b.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     d.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global. 
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//' answer "NO".   
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//' answer "NO".
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//' answer "NO".
  
 8.  If prompted "Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0// respond 0.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 The post-installation routine XU8PS630 will run automatically in the
 background to add JLV entries to the REMOTE APPLICATION file (#8994.5). 
 The routine will be automatically deleted after patch installation, as it 
 is intended to be run only once per site.
  
 Back out Instructions:
 ---------------------
  
    a.  Open the VistA MailMan message created during the "Backup a 
        Transport Global" step of the patch installation process (i.e.,
        Kernel and Kernel Toolkit Systems Management Guide, Section 23.7.8,
        "Backing Up Transport Globals").
    b.  Follow the installation sequence (i.e., Kernel and Kernel Toolkit
        Systems Management Guide, Section 23.7.1, "Installation Sequence")
        to load and install a patch from a PackMan message. This
        installation restores the original (pre-patch) VistA routine.
    c.  The backup patch will only restore pre-existing routines with their
        original version. It will not restore the modified print template 
        or RPC description, nor will it delete newly added data from the
        OPTION file (#19) or REMOTE APPLICATION file (#8994.5).
