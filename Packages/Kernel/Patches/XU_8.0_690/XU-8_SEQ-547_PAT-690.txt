Subject: KERNEL CRITICAL ALERT TEXT REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

  Current Functionality:
  ---------------------
   
  1. The "Critical Alerts Count Report" [XQAL CRITICAL ALERT COUNT] and
     "User Alerts Count Report" [XQAL USER ALERTS COUNT] options list
     critical alerts based upon entries in the ALERT CRITICAL TEXT file
     (#8992.3).
   
  2. The "Critical Alerts Count Report" [XQAL CRITICAL ALERT COUNT] and
     "User Alerts Count Report" [XQAL USER ALERTS COUNT] options will screen
     alerts from a critical designation when the alert contains text in
     the ALERT CRITICAL TEST file that is preceded by the word "NOT".
   
  3. The "User Alerts Count Report" [XQAL USER ALERTS COUNT] and the
     "Critical Alerts Count Report" [XQAL CRITICAL ALERT COUNT] options
     report total and critical alerts for users.  The options allow
     sorting by Name, Number, or Section/Service within a user selected
     date range.
  
  4. The "User Alerts Count Report" [XQAL USER ALERTS COUNT] and the
     "Critical Alerts Count Report" [XQAL CRITICAL ALERT COUNT] allow
     sub-sorting Section/Service by Name or Number within a user selected
     date range.
   
  5. The "List Alerts for a user from a specified date" [XQAL ALERT LIST
     FROM DATE] option will report all alerts for a selected user within
     a selected date range.
   
  6. The ALERT CRITICAL TEXT file (#8992.3) contains entries of text that
     indicate information in an alert is critical.  This is a VistA
     Infrastructure file designed to accommodate the addition of critical
     alerts in VistA.

  Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
  --------------------------------------------
   
  1. CA Ticket: I13903844FY17
     XQAL REPORTS MENU CRITICAL ALERTS COUNT REPORT and XQAL USER ALERTS 
     COUNT options displaying incorrect information.
   
     Problem:
     -------
     CPRS enhanced its' alerts and modified the alert text for 'Abnormal
     Image' critical alerts to contain the text "ABNL IMA".  Because the
     ALERT CRITICAL TEXT file (#8992.3) does not contain an entry for
     "ABNL IMA", the Critical indicator on the "Critical Alerts Count Report"
     [XQAL CRITICAL ALERT COUNT] and "User Alerts Count Report" [XQAL USER
     ALERTS COUNT] do not include the 'ABNL IMAGING' critical alerts.
   
     Resolution:
     ----------
     This patch adds 'ABNL IMA' as a new entry in the ALERT CRITICAL TEXT
     file (#8992.3) so that critical imaging alerts with the text "ABNL 
     IMAGE" will be reported.
  
     XU8P690 adds "ABNL IMA" to the ALERT CRITICAL TEXT file (#8992.3).
  
   
  2. CA Ticket: I13903844FY17
     XQAL REPORTS MENU CRITICAL ALERTS COUNT REPORT and XQAL USER ALERTS 
     COUNT options displaying incorrect information.
   
     Problem:
     -------
     CPRS enhanced its' alert system and modified some alerts to be indicated
     as not critical by preceding alert text {entered in the ALERT CRITICAL
     TEXT file (#8992.3)} with the word "NON".  The Kernel critical alert
     reports, "Critical Alerts Count Report" [XQAL CRITICAL ALERT COUNT] and
     "User Alerts Count Report" [XQAL USER ALERTS COUNT], only screen alerts
     from critical reporting when the critical text is preceded by "NOT" in
     the alert text.  Consequently, non-critical alerts containing critical
     text preceded by "NON" are reported as critical.
   
     Resolution:
     ---------- 
     This patch changes the Kernel critical alert reports so alerts with
     critical text preceded with "NON" will be screened from the Kernel
     Critical Alert report.
   
     CHKCRIT+13^XQALSUR2 modified to check for "NON" in Critical Alert text.
  
   
  3. Bugs discovered during patch development & testing
   
     Problem:
     -------
     During IOC testing, Charleston discovered that when the "Critical
     Alerts Count Report" [XQAL CRITICAL ALERT COUNT] or the "User Alerts
     Count Report" [XQAL USER ALERTS COUNT] options are displayed to the
     screen, they do not pause to allow the user to read the end of the
     report before returning to the menu.  Also the "User Alerts Count
     Report" [XQAL USER ALERTS COUNT] will not pause after displaying each
     page of the report to allow the user to read it before continuing to 
     the next page.
  
     Resolution:
     ----------
     This patch adds a pause when displayed to the screen (Home device)
     allowing the user to press <Enter> to continue displaying the next page
     or the option menu.
  
     PRTNAME+2^XQARPRT1 added QUIT when user does not quit from the middle of
     a screen display.
      
     PRTNUMBR+2^XQARPRT, PRTNUMBR+9^XQARPRT1 and PRTNUMBR+10^XQARPRT1 added
     QUIT when user quits from the middle of a screen display.
     PRTNUMBR+11^XQARPRT1 added a Parameter to call to PRINTVAL api to 
     control screen display pause.
      
     PRTSERVC^XQARPRT1 api was reconstructed to include a pause at the end of
     each page of a screen display.  The rework includes sending the result 
     of $$CHKSRV as a new parameter in the PRINTVAL api.
      
     PRINTVAL^XQARPRT1 was modified to receive a parameter indicating whether
     the page displayed to the screen needs to be paused with a prompt for 
     the user to press <Enter> to continue or ^ to exit.
  
     DQ1+5^XQARPRT1 added DIR and executes when the report is not Queued
     and the user quits from the middle of a screen display.
  
     XUPAUS^XQARPRT1 was added to display the pause prompt when displaying
     the report to the screen.
     
     HEADER+2^XQARPRT1 and HEADER+3^XQARPRT1 added Formfeed control for
     screen and printer output.
  
  
     Problem:
     -------
     Also during IOC testing, Charleston discovered that when the user
     enters the START DATE and END DATE while running the "Critical Alerts
     Count Report" [XQAL CRITICAL ALERT COUNT] and the "User Alerts Count
     Report" [XQAL USER ALERTS COUNT], the dates are not echoed to the
     screen.
  
     Resolution:
     ----------
     This patch also changes the START DATE and END DATE entries so
     that the entered dates are always echoed to the screen.  
  
     DATES+1^XQARPRT1 and DATES+4^XQARPRT1 modified DIR(0) to include "EX"
     in the 2nd piece to require entry of an exact start and end date and 
     echo those dates to the screen.
  
   
     Problem:
     -------
     Finally, another problem was discovered during IOC testing.
     Charleston and Martinsburg found that when the "Critical Alerts
     Count Report" [XQAL CRITICAL ALERT COUNT] and the "User Alerts
     Count Report" [XQAL USER ALERTS COUNT] attempt to list a user that does 
     not have a SERVICE/SECTION field (#29) defined for their entry in the 
     NEW PERSON file (#200), the reports abort and disconnect the user.  
     The SERVICE/SECTION field is required but it was discovered that some 
     applications create users directly in the NEW PERSON file without a 
     complete definition.
   
     Resolution:
     ----------
     This patch will check for a users' SERVICE/SECTION definition before
     reporting the user.  If the SERVICE/SECTION is missing, <No Service>
     is reported for the user.  An error trap entry is added for users on
     the report who are missing SERVICE/SECTION until the number of
     "Undefined SERVICE/SECTION Err" errors exceeds the KERNEL SYSTEMS
     PARAMETERS file (#8989.3) ERROR LIMIT field (#520.1) for the day.
   
     PRTSERVC^XQARPRT1 was modified to add parameters to the PRINTVAL call.
     One of the parameters is the result of $$CHKSRV.
  
     PRINTVAL^XQARPT1 was modified to check if SERVICE/SECTION is undefined
     for a user.  When SERVICE/SECTION is undefined, the local array XQANOTES
     is defined with an explanation of the problem caused by the missing 
     data.  An Error Trap is recorded up to the total allowed by the KERNEL 
     SYSTEMS PARAMETERS file (#8989.3) ERROR LIMIT field (#520.1).  When the 
     number of users missing SERVICE/SECTION exceeds the number allowed in 
     the Error Trap, a message is included on the report that no more users
     (missing SERVICE/SECTION) will be recorded in the Error Trap.
  
     CHKSRV^XQARPRT1 api was added to indicate a change to the currently
     reported SERVICE/SECTION.  This is invoked by the PRTSERVC api.
  
     XQZMAXER^XQARRT1 was added to return the KERNEL SYSTEMS PARAMETERS file
     (#8989.3) ERROR LIMIT field (#520.1) value.
    
  
  4. SNOW Ticket: INC1741116
     User receiving error on accessing Critical Alerts.
   
     Problem:
     -------
     Jackson reported a bug in the "Critical Alerts Count Report" [XQAL
     CRITICAL ALERT COUNT] and the "User Alerts Count Report" [XQAL USER
     ALERTS COUNT] reports.  When the "Critical Alerts Count Report"
     [XQAL CRITICAL ALERT COUNT] or the "User Alerts Count Report" [XQAL
     USER ALERTS COUNT] options are selected to sort by Section/Service
     and then enter return when selecting sub-sort Name or Number, the
     report will begin but abort with an error.
   
     Resolution:
     ----------
     This patch changes the sub-sort Name or Number selection so that
     it is required.
  
     ORDER+12^XQARPRT1 was modified to require entry of Name or Number
     selection and set XQAORDER=0 if the user enters '^' to exit.
  
    
  5. Bugs discovered during patch development & testing
   
     Problem:
     -------
     The "List Alerts for a user from a specified date" [XQAL ALERT LIST
     FROM DATE] option does not report the first Alert for a user when
     the selected date range begins after the date of a users' first alert.
   
     Resolution:
     ----------
     This patch adjusts the entered start date so that all alerts are listed
     for the user within the report date range.
   
     DQ1+5^XQARPRT2 was split into 2 lines and XQAIEN modified so $ORDER
     begins at first multiple entry.
     DQ1+11^XQARPRT2 was added to check for display to screen at end of
     report and prompt the user to press <Enter> to continue.
  
   
     Problem:
     -------
     During IOC testing, Charleston discovered a bug when a report is
     displayed to the screen.  When displayed to the screen, the "List
     Alerts for a user from a specified date" [XQAL ALERT LIST FROM DATE]
     option does not pause to allow the user to read the end of the report
     before returning to the menu.
   
     Resolution:
     ----------
     This report now checks for display to the screen.  If the report is 
     being output to the screen, the user is prompted to press <Enter> to 
     continue before completion and redisplay of the Kernel Menu.
   
     PRTNAME+2^XQARPRT1 added QUIT when user quits from the middle of a
     screen display.
      
     PRTNUMBR+2^XQARPRT, PRTNUMBR+9^XQARPRT1 and PRTNUMBR+10^XQARPRT1 added
     QUIT when user quits from the middle of a screen display.
     PRTNUMBR+11^XQARPRT1 added a Parameter to call to PRINTVAL api to 
     control screen display pause.
      
     PRTSERVC^XQARPRT1 api was reconstructed to include a pause at the end of
     each page of a screen display.  The rework includes sending the result 
     of $$CHKSRV as a new parameter in the PRINTVAL api.
      
     PRINTVAL^XQARPRT1 was modified to receive a parameter indicating whether
     the page displayed to the screen needs to be paused with a prompt for 
     the user to press <Enter> to continue or ^ to exit.
  
     DQ1+5^XQARPRT1 added DIR and executes when the report is not Queued
     and the user quits from the middle of a screen display.
  
     XUPAUS^XQARPRT1 was added to display the pause prompt when displaying
     the report to the screen.
  
     HEADER+2^XQARPRT1 and HEADER+3^XQARPRT1 added Formfeed control for
     screen and printer output.
  
   
     Problem:
     -------
     While testing the "List Alerts for a user from a specified date" [XQAL
     ALERT LIST FROM DATE] option and sending the report to a printer,
     it was discovered a FormFeed is executed before the report.  This wastes
     a sheet of paper.
   
     Resolution:
     ----------
     This report now checks for a tasked job before writing a FormFeed to
     the device.
  
     HEADER^XQARPRT2+1 was split to 2 lines and "IF '$D(ZTQUEUED) was added
     before "W:DOFF @IOF"
  
   
     Problem:
     -------
     During IOC testing, Charleston discovered a bug in the "List Alerts
     for a user from a specified date" [XQAL ALERT LIST FROM DATE] option.
     Entry of the report END DATE does not echo the date to the screen.
   
     Resolution:
     ----------
     Entry of the END DATE for the report will now echo the date to the
     screen. 
   
     DATES+4^XQARPRT2 DIR(0) was changed to include "EX" in the 2nd piece to
     require entry of an exact end date and to echo the entered end date to 
     the screen.
  
   
  6. Missing Integration Control
   
     Problem:
     -------
     VistA Infrastructure does not allow VistA applications to modify entries
     in the ALERT CRITICAL TEXT file (#8992.3).
   
     Resolution:
     ----------
     Integration Control Registration #6869 ('ALERT CRITICAL TEXT LOOKUP AND
     EDIT') is recorded to allow VistA application development teams to
     release patches that update the ALERT CRITICAL TEXT file (#8992.3).
  
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch XU*8*690 contains
 changes to a package referenced in ProPath standard titled: BBM Team
 Review of VistA Patches. This patch does not alter or modify any VistA
 Blood Bank software design safeguards or safety critical elements
 functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch XU*8*690 have no effect on Blood
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
