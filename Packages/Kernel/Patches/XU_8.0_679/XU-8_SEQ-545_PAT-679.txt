Subject: EPIP KERNEL REMEDIATION 1.0

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Patch XU*8.0*679 restricts access to electronic signature fields in the 
 NEW PERSON file (#200) for sites that elect to enable this patch 
 functionality. Currently, any user can access the DEGREE (#10.6), 
 SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME (#20.2), and SIGNATURE BLOCK TITLE (#20.3) 
 fields through the Electronic Signature options on the VistA User's 
 Toolbox menu. If patch restrictions are enabled, then access to these
 fields will be allowed only for users who are assigned the new XUSIG
 security key.
  
 To enable restrictions, authorized site personnel must set new general
 parameter XU SIG BLOCK DISABLE to a value of ON (1). The parameter
 definition is stored in the PARAMETER DEFINITION file (#8989.51), and the
 parameter data is stored in the PARAMETER file (#8989.5). If the parameter
 is set to ON and the user has the XUSIG security key assigned in the NEW
 PERSON file, then access to the restricted fields is allowed. If the
 parameter is set to ON, but the user does not have security key XUSIG
 assigned, then access to the restricted fields is not allowed. If the site
 leaves the parameter set to OFF (0), then access to all electronic
 signature fields is allowed.
  
 To set the XU SIG BLOCK DISABLE parameter to ON:
  
 1. Log in to VistA with programmer access.
  
 2. At the "Select OPTION NAME:" prompt, type XPAR MENU TOOLS and then
 press Enter.
  
 3. At the "Select General Parameter Tools Option:" prompt, type EP and 
 then press Enter.
  
 4. At the "Select PARAMETER DEFINITION NAME:" prompt, type XU SIG BLOCK 
 DISABLE and then press Enter. 
  
 5. At the "Sig Block Disable:" prompt, type YES and then press Enter.
  
 Two options on the VistA User's Toolbox menu are affected by this patch: 
 the Electronic Signature Code Edit [XUSESIG] option and the Electronic 
 Signature Block Edit [XUSESIG BLOCK] option. The [XUSESIG] option 
 currently allows users to edit their own electronic signature, including 
 the SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME and SIGNATURE BLOCK TITLE fields. If XU
 SIG BLOCK DISABLE is set to ON, then only supervisors holding the XUSIG
 key can update those fields. The [XUSESIG BLOCK] option currently allows
 supervisors to edit the SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME and DEGREE fields for
 other users. If XU SIG BLOCK DISABLE is set to ON, then only supervisors
 holding the XUSIG key can update those fields. In addition, this patch 
 enables access to the SIGNATURE BLOCK TITLE field through the [XUSESIG
 BLOCK] option. This allows supervisors holding the XUSIG key to enter the
 SIGNATURE BLOCK TITLE for other users after XU SIG BLOCK DISABLE is set 
 to ON.
  
 To maintain valid educational credentials, DEGREE field entries
 made through the [XUSESIG BLOCK] option will be restricted to valid
 degrees stored in the EDUCATION file (#20.11). To support this
 functionality, the patch adds new option [XUSESIG DEG] to the User 
 Management menu [XUSER]. This option, which is locked by the XUSIG
 security key, enables maintenance of DEGREE field entries in the EDUCATION
 file. VistA will use these records to validate user entries when appending
 one or more degrees to an electronic signature. This validation applies
 even when XU SIG BLOCK DISABLE is set to OFF.
  
 Note: Because VistA automatically cross-references DEGREE field entries in
 the NEW PERSON file with the DEGREE field (#6) in the NAME COMPONENTS file
 (#20), any updates made directly to the DEGREE field in the NAME
 COMPONENTS file will also be validated against degrees in the EDUCATION 
 file.
  
 This enhancement is used to maintain valid electronic signatures that 
 support billing. For example, when a new Nurse Anesthetist record is
 loaded into VistA, 'CNA' (Certified Nursing Assistant) might be
 incorrectly appended to the provider's name instead of 'CRNA' (Certified
 Registered Nurse Anesthetist). As a result, Consolidated Patient Account
 Centers (CPACs) would receive a National Provider Identifier (NPI)
 Registry error when billing insurance carriers for services. The
 Credentialing staff would then have to correct the credential so that the
 CPAC could bill to collect revenue.

         (CRT)', press <Enter>.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
  
 If XU SIG BLOCK DISABLE is set to ON, compile a list of individuals who 
 will have access to the menu options needed to maintain Electronic 
 Signatures and the DEGREE field (#10.6) in the NEW PERSON file (#200). 
 These individuals will need the XUSIG Security Key assigned to their NEW 
 PERSON file entry.
  
 Backout Procedure:
 ------------------
 Backout of this patch will be performed only with the concurrence and 
 participation of the appropriate VA site/region personnel. The decision 
 to back out the patch will be a joint decision between VA site/region 
 personnel and other appropriate VA personnel.
  
 Note: Due to the complexity of this patch, it is not recommended for 
 backout. However, in the event that a site decides to back out this 
 patch, the site should contact the National Service Desk (NSD) to submit 
 a help desk ticket. The development team will then assist with the backout
 process.
  
 Validation of Backout Procedure:
 --------------------------------
 The Backout procedure can be verified by printing the first two lines of 
 the XU routines contained in this patch using the option First Line 
 Routine Print [XU FIRST LINE PRINT]. Once the XU routines have been 
 backed out, the first two lines of the routines will no longer contain 
 the designation of patch XU*8.0*679 on line 2 in the patch list section.
  
 Note: This validation procedure only verifies that routine changes have 
 been backed out; it does not confirm that other patch component changes 
 have been backed out.
