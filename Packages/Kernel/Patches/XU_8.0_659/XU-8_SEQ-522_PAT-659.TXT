Description:
============

 This patch provides enhancements needed to implement Single Sign-On 
 Internal (SSOi) for identification and authentication of users into VistA.
  
 VAIQ #7613595 "Mandatory Use of PIV Multifactor Authentication to VA 
 Information Systems" dated June 30, 2015, requires all VA IT systems to be
 PIV-enabled and requires the use of multifactor authentication when using 
 a local, network, or remote account to log into a VA information system. 
 This patch provides the VistA Kernel utilities needed to implement this 
 requirement.
  
 The use of these utilities are expected to improve security and auditing
 capabilities in accordance with VA Handbook 6500 Appendix F and revision 4
 of NIST SP 800-53. As required by FIPS 199 and using guidance from NIST SP
 800-60, the recommended security categorization for these applications is
 HIGH.
  
 Integration with Identity and Access Management (IAM) services are 
 mandated by executive management via the following memorandums:
  - IAM Identity Services (IdS) mandate memorandum (VAIQ #7011145). All
    applications within VA must comply with IAM requirements to ensure that
    references to the identities of Veterans and their beneficiaries are 
    accurate. 
  - IAM Access Services (AcS) functionality within VA is mandated by VAIQ
    #7060071 (http://vaww.iam.domain.ext/IAM_Business_PMO.asp).
  
 The following changes have been made to implement SSOi in VistA:
  
 Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  - This patch adds or updates Remote Procedures to provide Kernel support
    for the IAM Provisioning and IAM Binding applications.
  - This patch adds or updates Remote Procedures to fully implement Kernel
    processing of IAM Secure Token Service (STS) tokens for secure
    authentication and identification of users authenticated by IAM using
    Active Directory credentials (KERBEROS or PIV Card).
  - The XUS IAM BIND USER and XUS ESSO VALIDATE Remote Procedures have 
    been added to the XUS SIGNON menu option to make them available to all 
    users.
  
 VistA Kernel Security
  - Per the VA Authentication, Authorization, and Audit (AAA) Design 
    Pattern, VA Applications shall implement Level of Assurance (LOA) 
    requirements for authentication. VA shall use guidance from OMB 04-04
    and NIST SP 800-63-2 to rate all existing applications to their
    appropriate LOA and implement appropriate security controls for user
    authentication to those applications. LOA for a user's authentication
    shall be determined by the weakest link in the authentication process.
    Application authentication protocols shall comply with all existing
    policy established in VA 6500.
  - This patch identifies the sign-on LOA when authenticating a user into 
    VistA using traditional and newly-developed authentication methods.
  - This patch records the LOA in the SIGN-ON LOG file (#3.081) if the 
    information is available.
  - In the future, when LOA identification is fully implemented into Kernel
    Security, access to VistA will be denied when little or no confidence 
    exists in the asserted user identity (DUZ("LOA")=1). Until then, VistA 
    application developers can choose to limit or deny access to individual
    applications or data when DUZ("LOA")=1.
  
 Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (VACAA)
 - This patch updates the API introduced in XU*8.0*655 to bulk-load non-VA 
   entities and providers. The updated API provides a means of making 
   recurring updates to the NEW PERSON file (#200) to identify non-VA
   providers when documenting patient care. The API is provided to
   Outpatient Pharmacy under private Integration Agreement #6230.
  
  
 Blood Bank Clearance
 ====================
 Clearance - 01/13/2016
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch XU*8.0*659 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in ProPath standard titled BBM Team 
 Review of VistA Patches. This patch does not alter or modify any VistA
 Blood Bank software design safeguards or safety critical elements
 functions.
   
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch XU*8.0*659 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
