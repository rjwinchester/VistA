Subject: POINTER TO FILE 8992.3 FOR CRITICAL ALERT TERMS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The ALERT CRITICAL TEXT file (#8992.3) was added with
 patch XU*8*513 to make it easier for packages or
 Medical Centers to specify text that should be used
 to indicate an alert that is marked as critical.  
 The Report Menu for Alerts [XQAL REPORTS MENU] has options
 that generate reports and displays critical alerts for the
 alerts package. Currently options check for critical Alert
 text coding the critical text into the code and checking
 the alert for the text. This patch will change the way
 the text is checked. The crititcal text has been taken out of
 the code and now the code checks the new file ALERT CRITICAL TEXT
 file (#8992.3) for the existence of all critical text.

 1. INC000000852952 :  Update routine XQARPRT1 to point to 
  the new file 8992.3 ALERT CRITICAL TEXT file
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Identifying critical alerts was done by hard coding a check for a specific word 
 In the routine XQARPRT1.  If the word Critical or Abnormal IMA was in the subject of the alert, it was deemed a critical alert.  This coding did not allow for  any flexibility if a new word was added as a critical text.  The code would have to b
 e patched every time a word was added as critical. 
 ----------
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Changing the code to point to the new Alert Critical Text file (8992.3)  added in patch XU*8.0*513,  the user can add a new word or phrase  into the file if they consider it critical text and that will flag the alert as critical.

 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following option. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch #(ex.
     XU*8.0*631):
  
     a.  Print Transport Global - This option lets you print the contents
         of a Transport Global that is currently loaded in the ^XTMP
         global.
     b.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     d.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.  NOTE:  When installed in a TEST environment, 
         your BEFORE checksums might not match the values shown below if
         any of the routines were modified to display <TEST ACCOUNT> in
         the VistA menu prompts.  The checksums should match in a
         production environment.
