Subject: DIRECT MODE PROGRAMMER ACCESS AUDIT

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch was created in support of an OIG request to more closely monitor
 programmer mode access to VistA systems.  
  
 The concept and design of this option was originally done by Byran Lucas who is
 with Enterprise Systems Engineering, Health Systems Platforms (ESEHSP).  
  
 The patch installs one option named Direct-mode Programmer Access
 Audits [XUPROGAUD] and places it on the existing menu XUSPY, which is for
 Information Security Officers, and is placed on the sub-menu Access Monitor
 Menu [XUMNACCESS].
  
 There are no M routines included in this patch, the option makes a call via the
 ENTRY ACTION field of the new option to a pre-existing program in the %SYS
 namespace in Cache', the audit report features of Cache' are called which allow
 the user to view the audit reports captured by the Cache' audit management
 processes. The called routine (%ZSPECIAL) is distributed to all sites, and is
 maintained by ESEHSP.
