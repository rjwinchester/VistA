Associated patches: (v)XU*8*569    <<= must be installed BEFORE `XU*8*674'

Subject: FIX XQCS TMP GLOBAL

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes a problem where Cache process IDs (PIDs or $J) are reused
 during periods of high-volume client-server connections (many new
 connections within a day). Data in the ^TMP("XQCS",$J) global is not
 deleted when a connection is reset, and will persist into a new user
 session, often causing RPC Broker connection errors.
  
 This patch ensures that processes do not reuse ^TMP("XQCS") nodes for 
 previously used PIDs.

  I10534388FY16 ANR87053 INTERMITTENT RPC BROKER ERRORS
  
 1. I10534388FY16 ANR87053 INTERMITTENT RPC BROKER ERRORS
  
 Problem:
 -------
 CPRS and CAPRI users receive intermittent errors "The remote procedure 
 XUS SIGNON SETUP is not registered to the option XUS SIGNON." The remote 
 procedure name or option name may vary, but the result is temporary 
 inability to sign in or an occasional GUI crash. Client applications 
 (including but not limited to Veterans Crisis Line) built using Medical
 Domain Web Services (MDWS) or the MDWS MDO.DLL experience the problem more
 frequently due to the stateless nature of the connection, and
 non-descriptive errors are returned. The result is that users cannot sign
 in to the MDWS applications. This is especially noticeable on Monday
 mornings when there is a higher volume of VistA connections, or during
 periods of network instability.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 During periods of high-volume activity (many new connections) or network 
 instability (disconnects leading to RPC Broker listener restarts), VistA 
 servers may reuse internal job numbers ($J). A temporary global used to 
 store information for a particular job is not being cleared, and the data 
 persists to the next job when a job number is reused. The resolution is 
 to kill the temporary global upon a new connection (user not yet 
 authenticated) so that it may be rebuilt for the new connection.
