Description:
============

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Interagency Program Office (IPO)
 and the Department of Defense (DoD) is tasked by its charter with
 leading the Departments' efforts "to implement national health data
 standards for interoperability and [be] responsible for establishing,
 monitoring, and approving the clinical and technical standards profile
 and processes to ensure a seamless [exchange] of health data." This task
 of Native Domain standardization is aligned with achieving the goals
 outlined in the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requiring
 that the Departments' "healthcare data [are] computable in real-time and
 [comply] with existing national data standards" and that the "data [are]
 standardized as national standards continue to evolve."
  
 This patch (XU*8.0*671) in conjunction with patches XU*8.0*677 and
 HDI*1.0*18 moves the updating and deployment of the PERSON CLASS
 file (#8932.1) from the Kernel team to the Standards & Terminology
 Services (STS) team.
 The PERSON CLASS file(#8932.1) will remain within the KERNEL name/
 number space.

 * When STS deploys an update to the PERSON CLASS file (#8932.1) a       *
 * message is sent to the NTRT_NOTIFICATION-L listserv.                  *
 *************************************************************************
  
 The following message will be sent in the Post install Routine XU671PO

 * PLEASE NOTE: The Kernel Team will no longer be deploying the updates  *

 * The Standards & Terminology Services Team (STS) will use an automated *
 * e-mail delivery "listserv" to notify users of updates to the PERSON   *
 * CLASS File (#8932.1).                                                 *
 * All personnel that maintain associations between users and the Person *

 * PERSON CLASS File (#8932.1).                                          *
