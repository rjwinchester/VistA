  Installation Instructions
  =========================
  
  1. Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the installation. 
     However, it is recommended that the patch be installed during
     non-peak time. It will take about two minutes to install the
     patch, but you may queue the installation if you wish.
   
  2. You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
   
  3. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This      
     option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
   
  4. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your system. 
     You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global. On the KIDS
     menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following options:
   
                  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
                  Print Transport Global
                  Compare Transport Global to Current System
                  Backup a Transport Global
   
     On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
     option:
                  Install Package(s)  
                  Select INSTALL NAME:XU*8.0*654
                                      ==========
  
   Accept the defaults for the following install questions:  
   Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?  NO//
   Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO// 
  
 The routines XUMF654, and XUMF654P will be deleted at the end of this
 patch installation. If you wish to get the checksum values, you can
 'Verify Checksums in Transport Global' prior to patch install:
  
 Select Kernel Installation & Distribution System Option: INstallation
  
    1      Load a Distribution
    2      Verify Checksums in Transport Global
    3      Print Transport Global
    4      Compare Transport Global to Current System
    5      Backup a Transport Global
    6      Install Package(s)
           Restart Install of Package(s)
