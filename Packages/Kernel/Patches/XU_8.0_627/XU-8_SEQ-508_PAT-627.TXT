Associated patches: (v)XU*8*484    <<= must be installed BEFORE `XU*8*627'

Subject: OPTION ASSUMES A* NAMESPACE IS LOCAL

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes a problem found while adding a new option to the OPTION
 file (#19).  Previously, only local namespaces were assigned to A*.  Now, 
 several VistA software packages use the A* namespace for valid nationally 
 released VistA packages.  When entering a new option that starts with the 
 letter 'A', the system always identifies/displays the option as located 
 in the local namespace.  The patch corrects this by the following logic: 
 if the new option name starts with an 'A', check first for a national 
 package namespace starting with the letters entered and if found, 
 identify/display that package name rather than 'local namespace'.

 1. INC000000064398 A* namespaces not computed properly
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Previously, only local namespaces were assigned to A*.  Now, several 
 VistA software packages use the A* namespace for valid nationally 
 released VistA packages.  When entering a new option that starts with the 
 letter 'A', Fileman always identifies/displays the option as located in 
 the local namespace, even if the namespace of the option is associated 
 with a VistA nationally released package. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This problem is corrected this by the following logic: if the new option 
 name starts with an 'A', check first for a national package namespace 
 starting with the letters entered and if found, identify/display that 
 package name rather than 'local namespace'.
