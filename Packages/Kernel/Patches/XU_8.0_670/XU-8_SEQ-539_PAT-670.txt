 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ----------------------------
 No associated Remedy Tickets
  
  
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 Currently the Runtime Utilization Monitor (RUM) collects cache metrics on 
 business events (Menu Option, TaskMan Job and Remote Procedure Calls) and
 rolls the data up to weekly totals. This is not useful in today's
 capacity planning world. This data needs to be aggregated to much smaller
 time frames.
  
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
 The VistA Business Event Monitor will collect Cache specific metrics for 
 individual business events in such a way that they can be correlated with
 other tools gathering operating system level metrics. Combined this will
 provide the ability to plan future deployments based on current business
 workloads and to derive requirements for new capabilities.
  
 Problem 2:
 ----------
 The VistA Timed Collection Monitor collects data by reading directly from 
 an InterSystems system global. InterSystems has provided APIs that can be 
 used for this purpose.
  
 Resolution 2:
 -------------
 Modified collection functions to utilize InterSystems provided APIs
  
 Problem 3:
 ----------
 Additional data is needed to enhance reporting capabilities.
  
  
 Resolution 3:
 -------------
         1) Added 3 letter site code to returned data.
         2) Added Instance Name to returned data.
         3) Added Block Collisions metric to timed collections.
  
 Problem 4:
 ----------
 There is currently no way to collect inbound/outbound message counts for 
 VistA systems nor the ability to collect and store metrics on the message 
 routing.
  
 Resolution 4:
 -------------
 The VistA Message Count Monitor will collect HL7 and HLO message counts 
 at a regularly scheduled interval. The VistA HL7 Monitor will collect 
 metrics on the messages themselves.

 Software/Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ------------------------------------- 
 Software being released as a host file and documentation describing the 
 new functionality introduced by this patch are available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server.
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directory at the following 
  
  Hines             domain.ext

 Patch Installation:
  
 Note:  Patches XU*8.0*670 and KMP*4*0 will be installed as part of
 host file XU_8_670.KID. Installation instructions below are inclusive of
 all patches, though it is recommended that installer read all related
 patch descriptions for awareness of changes.
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ------------------------------- 
 Patches XU*8.0*670 and KMP*4.0*0 each have a post install routine that 
 will run after patch installation. Post install routines will remain in 
 the case they are needed. However, they can be deleted if desired once 
 patch has been verified.
  
 The post installation routine ZOSVKSP2 (with patch XU*8.0*670) will save
 routines ZOSVKSD and ZOSVKRO as %ZOSVKSD and %ZOSVKR respectively with
 a call to MOVE^%ZTMGRSET.
  
 The post installation routine KMPVPST2 (with patch KMP*4.0*0) will set 
 the proper values into the VSM CONFIGURATION and VSM MONITOR DEFAULT 
 files and start the VistA Business Event Monitor.
  
 NOTE:  The VistA Business Event Monitor and the VistA Message Count 
        Monitor will not start automatically on test systems. If desired
        set field "ALLOW TEST" to "yes" in the VSM MANAGEMENT menu and then
        start monitor.               
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
  
 This installation can be queued.
  
  
 Installation Instructions: 
 --------------------------

 NOTES: 
    1) If this is being installed in a test system, and if testing will be 
 done on the test system, please send a Mailman Message to
 G.CPE-CP-SUPPORT@VISTA.CPE.DOMAIN.EXT providing the domain name and I.P. 
 address of the test system. This will allow acknowledgements to be sent 
 back to the site.
  
    2) Once the software has been installed on the production system it is 
 recommended to turn all VSM monitors OFF in the test system as 
 they are not needed. Use the VSM Management option to stop the monitors 
 in the test system. By default the VSM monitors will not run on test 
 systems.
