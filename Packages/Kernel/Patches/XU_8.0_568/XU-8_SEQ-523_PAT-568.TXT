 Problem:
 --------
 SAGG was originally written to function on Windows and VMS operating 
 systems. Storage metrics are not properly collected when Cache/VistA
 is running on the Linux operating system. These metrics are needed to 
 plan storage configuration and purchases.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Re-write SAGG metric collection to utilize current Cache versions APIs to 
 collect storage metrics on all operating systems.
  
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Bay Pines VA Healthcare System
 VA Connecticut HCS (West Haven, Newington)
 Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital (Hines)
  
  
  
 Software/Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 ------------------------------------- 
 Software being released as a host file and documentation describing the 
 new functionality introduced by this patch are available.
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server.
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directory at the following 
  
  Albany            domain.ext
  Hines             domain.ext
  Salt Lake City    domain.ext
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at: http://www4.domain.ext/vdl/

 Patch Installation:
  
 Note:  Patches XU*8.0*568, KMPD*3.0*3,KMPR*2.0*4, KMPS*2.0*1 and KMPV*1*0
 will all be installed as part of host file XU_8_568.KID. Installation
 instructions below are inclusive of all patches, though it is recommended
 that installer read all related patch descriptions for awareness of
 changes.
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 ------------------------------- 
 Prior to installation verify that there exists an entry for 
 VISTA.CPE.DOMAIN.EXT in the DOMAIN file. If this entry does not exist 
 then see informational patch XM*999*178 for instructions on adding this 
 domain.
  
 Patches XU*8.0*568, KMPS*2.0*1 and KMPV*1*0 each have a post install 
 routine that will run after patch installation. Post install routines 
 will remain in the case they are needed. However, they can be deleted if 
 desired once patch has been verified.
  
 The post installation routine ZOSVKSPI will save routines ZOSVKSOE, 
 ZOSVKSOS and ZOSVKRO as %ZOSVKSE, %ZOSVKSD and %ZOSVKR respectively with 
 a call to MOVE^%ZTMGRSET.
  
 The post installation routine for KMPS*2.0*1 removes entries from the 
 G.A1B5@FO-BIRM.DOMAIN.EXT and G.A1B5@ISC-BIRM.DOMAIN.EXT mail groups.
  
 The post installation routine for KMPV*1*0 sets the proper values into 
 the VSM CONFIGURATION and VSM MONITOR DEFAULTS files. 
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions:
 ------------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install. A menu rebuild will occur when the patch is installed.
  
 This installation can be queued. However, the post-installation step to 
 verify the "KMPS SAGG PROJECT" option is queued in TaskMan still needs to
 be completed seperately. 
  
  
 Installation Instructions: 
 --------------------------
  
 1. Retrieve the host file from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of
    the OI Field Offices.  The preferred method is to SFTP the file from
    DOWNLOAD.VISTA.DOMAIN.EXT, which will transmit the file from the first
    available server.  Alternatively, sites may elect to retrieve the file
    from a specific OI Field Office.
  
    OI FIELD OFFICE     SFTP ADDRESS                    DIRECTORY
    Albany              DOMAIN.EXT       
    Hines               DOMAIN.EXT        
    Salt Lake City      DOMAIN.EXT          
  
    The software distribution includes:
  
  FILE NAME             DESCRIPTION             FORMAT
  ---------             ------------            ------
  XU_8_568.KID           KIDS Build Host File   ASCII  
  
 2. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
    the Installation Menu.  From this menu, select the option Load a 
    Distribution and select XU_8_568.KID. KIDS will load all patches
    from the host file.  
  
  
 3. From the Installation Menu, you may elect to use the following options.
    When prompted for the INSTALL NAME enter the patch XU*8.0*568:
                                          
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
  
  
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install, XU*8.0*568.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? YES//' enter 'YES'.     
  
         Note: Menu options for the KMPS*2.0*1 patch need to be rebuilt.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//' enter 'NO'.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//  enter 'NO'.
  
         Options, menu options, or protocols  do not need to be disabled.
  
 8.  If prompted "Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0// respond 0.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 -------------------------------
 Once this patch has been installed, the VSM Driver Task must be added to 
 the Cache Task Manager. (Not VistA TaskMan). The installer must have
 either the %All or the %Manager Role to accomplish this task.
  
 The installer must:
   1. Log directly on to each Front End node and on to the Back End Node.
   2. Navigate to a command prompt in the default namespace.
   3. Execute the following:  D KMPVTSK^KMPVCBG
   4. If this causes an error please send a MailMan message to 
      G.CPE-CP-SUPPORT@VISTA.CPE.DOMAIN.EXT. This most likely means that
      your system is not configured with the standard default namespace
      variable. This should be fixed unless there is a specific reason at
      your site.
  
 These steps will add the VSM Driver Task to each node. This step is 
 essential for the proper operation of the VistA System Monitor.
  
 Verify that the KMPS SAGG REPORT option is scheduled in TaskMan. If it is 
 not then schedule this option using "Schedule/Unschedule Options [XUTM 
 SCHEDULE]" under the "Taskman Management" menu. It should be scheduled to 
 run every 28 days to ensure same day-of-week collection cycles. 
  
  
 NOTES: 
    1) If this is being installed in a test system, and if testing will be 
 done on the test system, please send a Mailman Message to
 G.CPE-CP-SUPPORT@VISTA.CPE.DOMAIN.EXT providing the domain name and I.P. 
 address of the test system. This will allow acknowledgements to be sent 
 back to the site.
    2) The KMPVOPS security key is needed to access the VSM MANAGEMENT 
 menu option.
    3) Once the software has been installed on the production system it is 
 recommended to turn the VTCM and VSTM monitors OFF in the test system as 
 they are not needed. Use the VSM Management option to stop the monitors 
 in the test system.
