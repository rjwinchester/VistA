 =======================================================================
 This patch must be installed after PX*1.0*210
 =======================================================================
   
 The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) Immunizations Enhancements (VIMM) 2.0 project modifies existing
 files and adds additional files to enable VA to quickly and reliably
 document and exchange standardized skin test and immunization information
 on beneficiaries across services and departments. Additionally,
 modifications support VistA Evolution requirements. This provides a
 Veteran patient-centric vaccine record exchangeable with the external
 community. Clinicians will have access to a more complete medical history
 in the VistA electronic medical record resulting in improved health status
 as well as public health monitoring.
  
 The goals for the VIMM 2.0 project are to deliver an Initial Operating
 Capability comprised of standard, interoperable skin test and immunization
 data for exchange with external trading partners based on the
 modernization of the VistA Patient Care Encounter (PCE) package.
  
 The existing PCE Immunizations Health Summary is modified and four new 
 Immunization components are added in this patch. The new Health Summary
 features include:
  
 1. IM - PCE IMMUNIZATIONS (Existing)
 The format of the existing Immunizations Health Summary report has been
 modified to display the standard Name implemented in PX*1.0*201 in place
 of the short name. Information about reactions and contraindications
 has been re-formatted as well. If an immunization is associated with a
 reaction and/or contraindication, a '<**>' is displayed at the end of the
 line under 'Reaction'. Complete details about the reaction and/or
 contraindication appear in a footnote at the bottom of the report. If the
 record has a comment, a '<C> is displayed under 'Info'. Comments no longer
 appear on this report but can be viewed in the Detailed Immunizations
 Health Summary component.
  
 2. SIM - PCE IMMUNIZATIONS SELECTED  (New)
 The new SIM Health Summary report allows a user to select immunizations as
 well as time and occurrence limits. The user can select an unlimited
 number of the immunizations defined in the Immunization (#9999999.14)
 file. The user may select a time limit up to 99 years and 999 maximum
 occurrences. Individual records are displayed in alphabetical order by
 immunization name and then by administration date in reverse chronological
 order.
  
 The format of the display is the same format used in the PCE IMMUNIZATIONS
 Health Summary (IM). The report displays immunization name, series,
 administration date and facility. If there is a reaction and/or
 contraindication, the record is marked with a '<**>'. The name of the
 immunization, date of administration and reaction/contraindications are
 displayed at the end of the display. If the record has a comment it is
 marked with a <C>. Comments can be viewed in the Detailed Immunizations
 Health Summary component.
  
 3. DIM - PCE IMMUNIZATIONS DETAILED (New) 
 DIM is a new Health Summary report that presents twenty-five immunization 
 data elements in a Fileman captioned style.
  
 The data elements include: 
    immunization name,
    full name, 
    series, 
    administration date,
    facility,
    reaction, 
    contraindications,
    manufacturer,
    lot number,
    expiration date,
    dosage,
    administration route,
    administration site,
    vaccine information statements offered to the patient,
    administered by,
    ordered by,
    documented by,
    comments, 
    results,
    reading,
    date read,
    reader,
    reading recorded,
    hours read post-inoculation,
    and reading comment.
  
 Individual immunization records are sorted in alphabetical order by
 immunization name and then by administration date in reverse chronological
 order. 
  
 4. SIMR - PCE IMMUN SELECT REVERSE CHRON (New)
 SIMR is a new Health Summary report that also allows the user to select
 immunizations and time and occurrence limits. Individual
 immunization records are sorted in reverse chronological order and then
 alphabetically by immunization name. The user is allowed to select any of
 the immunizations defined in the Immunization (#9999999.14) file. The user
 may select a time limit up to 99 years and 999 maximum occurrences.
  
 The format of the SIMR display is the same format used in the PCE
 IMMUNIZATIONS Health Summary (IM). 
  
 5. SIMC - PCE IMMUNIZATIONS SELECT CHRON (New)
 SIMC is a new Health Summary report that allows the user to select
 immunizations as well as time and occurrence limits. Individual
 immunization records are sorted in chronological order and then
 alphabetically by immunization name. 
  
 The format of the display is the same format used in the PCE IMMUNIZATIONS
 Health Summary (IM).
