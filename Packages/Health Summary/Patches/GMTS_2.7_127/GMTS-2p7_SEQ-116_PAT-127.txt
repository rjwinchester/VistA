 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
 1. INC3453605 - CPRS error "<SUBSCRIPT>OPTDISP+11^GMTSPST1"
  
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 If a user attempts to use the Health Summary component Med Reconciliation 
 (MRT1) on a patient with a supply quick order without a Quantity the hard 
 error <SUBSCRIPT>OPTDISP+11^GMTSPST1 occurs.
  
 Resolution 1:
 -------------
 Routine GMTSPST1 was modified so that the hard error will no longer occur.
  
  
 2. INC4173537 - VISTA MUMPS ERROR: <SUBSCRIPT>OPTDISP+11^GMTSPSTN*ORQLN
  
 Problem 2:
 ----------
 If a user attempts to use the Health Summary component Med Reconciliation 
 (MRR1) on a patient with a supply quick order without a Quantity the hard 
 error <SUBSCRIPT>OPTDISP+11^GMTSPSTN occurs.
  
 Resolution 2:
 -------------
 Routine GMTSPSTN was modified so that the hard error will no longer occur.
  
  
 3. INC4082824 - New MRT1 Health Summary component is causing OPTDISP+11 M
                 Errors From GMTS*2.7*94 patch
  
 Problem 3:
 ----------
 When entering order text, the provider can create a preceding space in 
 front of the "Quantity" line of the order text. Health Summary component 
 Med Reconciliation (MRT1) normally bypasses this "Quantity" line and the 
 quantity is displayed elsewhere. Having this proceeding space will cause 
 the quantity line to print (inappropriately) in the component output.    
  
 Resolution 3:
 -------------
 Modified Routine GMTSPST1 to strip proceeding spaces prior to evaluating 
 the Line.
  
  
 4. INC4308565 - 103-134A > Medication Reconciliation note 34934 < x45117,
                 error OPTDISP+11^GMTSPSTN
  
 Problem 4:
 ----------
 When entering order text, the provider can create a preceding space in 
 front of the "Quantity" line of the order text. Health Summary component 
 Med Reconciliation (MRR1) normally bypasses this "Quantity" line and the 
 quantity is displayed elsewhere. Having this proceeding space will cause 
 the quantity line to print (inappropriately) in the component output.    
  
 Resolution 4:
 -------------
 Modified Routine GMTSPSTN to strip proceeding spaces prior to evaluating 
 the Line.
  
  
 5. INC4009145 - CPRS printed report doesn't match report displayed within
                 CPRS
  
 Problem 5:
 ----------
 In CPRS reports tab --> Health summary--> Essential Med List for Review: 
 In CRPS the report that is on the screen versus the report when printed 
 (file--> print selected item) are not matching. This is happening for 
 outpatient medications that are being "changed." The CPRS list shows the 
 new pending directions, however when you print the same report, it is 
 showing the old directions as pending.  This has been found to be an 
 issue for both MRT1 and MRR1 HS components.
  
 Resolution 5:
 -------------
 When the order is pending the data for both the discontinued order and 
 the pending order are returned from a call to TEXT^ORQ12.  Routines 
 GMTSPST1 & GMTSPSTN display the instructions for the discontinued order.  
 This patch modifies the GM routines to display the instructions for the 
 pending order correctly.
