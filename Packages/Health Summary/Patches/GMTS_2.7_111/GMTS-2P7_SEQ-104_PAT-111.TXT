 ICD-10-CM will replace ICD-9-CM as the diagnostic coding system.  
 ICD-10-PCS will replace the ICD-9-CM procedural coding system.  Veterans 
 Health Administration (VHA) software remediation for ICD-10 enabled the 
 transition to support the use of the ICD-10 code sets; this PTF 
 Modifications project will increase the maximum allowable codes in the 
 entry, display, lookup, view, print, storage, and transmission of the 
 ICD-10 code sets in the VistA legacy and HealtheVet systems.
  
 The ICD-10 PTF Modifications team proposes new functionality within the 
 VistA Admission Discharge Transfer (ADT) module to allow up to 25 ICD-10 
 diagnosis codes in 701 and 501 transactions including 25 corresponding 
 Present on Admission (POA) indicators and to allow up to 25 ICD-10 
 procedure codes in 401 and 601 transactions. 
  
 Currently, 701 transactions allow one ICD-10 principal diagnosis with a 
 POA indicator and up to 13 secondary diagnoses with POA indicators for a 
 total of 14 ICD-10 diagnosis codes and 14 POA indicators. The 501 
 transactions allow 10 ICD-10 diagnoses codes with POA indicators. The 401 
 Surgeries and 601 Procedures transactions currently allow up to 5 ICD-10 
 procedure codes each.
  
 This Health Summary patch will update the following Health Summary 
 Components (#142.1) to include the expanded fields as indicated:
  
 MAS ADMISSIONS/DISCHARGES - Updated to display one principal diagnosis 
                             code and up to 24 secondary diagnosis codes
                             with each occurrence.
  
 MAS ADT HISTORY EXPANDED -  Updated to display one principal diagnosis 
                             code and up to 24 secondary diagnosis codes
                             with each occurrence.
  
 MAS DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS -   Updated to display one principal diagnosis 
                             code and up to 24 secondary diagnosis codes
                             with each occurrence.
  
 MAS PROCEDURES ICD CODES -  Updated to display up to 25 procedure codes 
                             with each occurrence
  
 MAS SURGERIES ICD CODES -   Updated to display up to 25 operation codes 
                             with each occurrence
  
  
 The following reports utilize one or more of the aforementioned Health 
 Summary Components and will therefore now display the expanded data 
 fields as appropriate.
  
 HEALTH SUMMARY (#142)
    REMOTE DEMO/VISITS/PCE (1Y)
    REMOTE DEMO/VISITS/PCE (3M)
    REMOTE DUS SUM/SURG/PROD (12Y)
  
 OE/RR REPORT (#101.24)
    ORRPW ADT ADM DC
    ORRPW ADT DC DIAG
    ORRPW ADT EXP
    ORRPW ADT ICD PROC
    ORRPW ADT ICD SURG
    ORRPW DOD ADT EXP
  
 NOTE: This patch modifies the routine logic for the five Health Summary 
 Components listed above.  Health Summary Components can be used in 
 several ways within VistA.  Any of the following *locally created* items 
 will also be affected by the newly updated display capability included in 
 this patch IF those items leverage any of the affected components to 
 generate output.
  
   Health Summary Types
   Health Summary Objects
   TIU/Health Summary Objects
   OE/RR Reports
  
 Objects may be of particular interest as the newly expanded display would 
 be more noticeable when an object is embedded in areas such as 
 boilerplate text, note templates, and reminder dialog templates.

 Software & Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
 =====================================
 The software for this set of patches is not being distributed through the 
 National Patch Module. 
  
 Patch DG*5.3*884 (Registration) is being released along with GMTS*2.7*111
 (Health Summary), IB*2.0*522 (Integrated Billing), LR*5.2*442 (Lab
 Service), ROR*1.5*25 (Clinical Case Registries), and OR*3.0*406
 (Order Entry/Results Reporting) in a multi-package build (host
 file).
  
 Because this is a multi-package build, it can only be distributed as a
 host file; no builds are included in the patch messages. The name of the
 host file is: ICD_10_PTF_MODIFICATIONS.KID; it can be obtained from one of
 the anonymous file transfer protocol (ftp) directories listed below. 
  
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
 patch is also available and can be obtained from one of the anonymous 
 file transfer protocol (ftp) directories listed below.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from: 
  
  ftp://download.vista.domain.ext/
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as 
 follows:
  
 Albany         ftp.domain.ext  <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
 Hines          ftp.domain.ext   <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
 Salt Lake City ftp.domain.ext     <ftp://ftp.domain.ext>
  
 Note: 
  - Please use the 'Binary' transfer method for retrieval of .pdf files
  - Please use the 'ASCII' transfer method for retrieval of .KID files
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at: http://www.domain.ext/vdl/
  
 The software distribution includes these file(s):
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ICD_10_PTF_MODIFICATIONS.KID
