Subject: HOME TELEHEALTH TEMPLATES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Other

Description:
============

 The VHA Office of Connected Care (10P8) wishes to have a comprehensive, 
 integrated template set in use at all VA facilities caring for Home 
 Telehealth patients.  This functionality is being released as part of a 
 multi-package build that also includes PXRM*2.0*19 and TIU*1*258.
  
 Specifically, this GMTS patch will add two new Health Summary reports for 
 display on the CPRS Reports tab. These reports will display both local 
 and remote data.
  
 The post-init of this GMTS patch will install the new entries in the 
 HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE file (#142). They are:
  REMOTE HT CLINICAL REMINDERS
  REMOTE HT TRACKING
  
 Stub entries are created in the ^GMT(142 global, and then the Reminder 
 Exchange file, VA-HT REMOTE HEALTH SUMMARY TYPES, will be silently
 installed via the Reminder Exchange utility.

 Software & Documentation Retrieval Instructions
 ------------------------------------ 
 Software being released as a host file and/or documentation describing 
 the new functionality introduced by this patch are available. There is a
 multi-package build named HT TEMPLATES PROJECT 1.0 which contains the
 following KIDS builds: PXRM*2.0*19, TIU*1.0*258, and GMTS*2.7*98.  The
 associated host file is named HT_TEMPLATES_1_0.KID.
  
 Additionally, there are two TXML template files for use in CPRS GUI.  HT
 MONTLY MONITOR.TXML, and HT PROVIDER CONSULT.TXML are bundled in the
 HT_TXML_TEMPLATES.zip file.
  
 IT installers should ensure that each site for which they are installing
 receive a copy of the zip file and the Install and Setup Guide. 
  
 The preferred method is to retrieve files from download.vista.domain.ext.
 This transmits the files from the first available server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve files directly from a specific server. 
  
 Sites may retrieve the software and/or documentation directly using 
 Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at the following OI Field Offices:
    
 Albany:                 domain.ext
 Hines:                  domain.ext    
 Salt Lake City:         domain.ext
    
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library 
 at: http://www4.domain.ext/vdl/

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 This patch contains an environment check routine, GMTSPI98, that will run 
 when the KIDS build is first loaded.  This routine checks for the 
 presence of any file entries at IEN 5000018 and 5000019 in the ^GMT(142 
 global. These IENs should be undefined/empty as the 5000000+ IEN range 
 is reserved for new National remote health summary types.  If an entry is 
 found at either location, the install will abort.  If this occurs, the 
 site should contact the National Help Desk for assistance with the Health 
 Summary package and moving the existing entry(ies) to a different IEN in 
 the ^GMT(142 global.  Once this has been corrected, the site may then 
 re-load and re-install the bundle.
  
 Pre-Installation will remove any previous version of the associated 
 Reminder Exchange entry for the GMTS patch components and create stub 
 entries in ^GMT(142,5000018 and ^GMT(142,5000019 for two new Remote 
 HEALTH SUMMARY TYPES.
  
 Post-installation will use Reminder Exchange silent install to complete 
 the installation of the Health Summary Types.
  
 GMTSPI98 can safely be deleted from the system once installation is 
 successful and all HT reminders, reminder dialogs, and associated 
 templates have been verified to be complete and working as expected.
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 Please refer to the Clinical Reminders Patch 19 Install and Setup Guide 
 for detailed pre-installation steps and information.
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------

 Clinical Reminders Patch 19 Install and Setup Guide contains the detailed
 steps and information necessary to successfully install this software
 bundle.
  
 This installation should not be queued.
  
 This build can be installed with users on the system, but it should be 
 done during non-peak hours. Estimated installation time is approximately 
 20 minutes.

     SFTP Server to the directory on your system.
  
 2.  Use LOAD A DISTRIBUTION option on the KIDS INSTALLATION menu, and

         message of any routines exported with this build. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this build
         is installed. It compares all components of this build
         (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and 
     choose the build to install.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
