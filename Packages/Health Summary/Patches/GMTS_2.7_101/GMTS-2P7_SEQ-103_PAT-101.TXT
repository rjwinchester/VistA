Subject: ICD-10 - Health Summary Updates

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION Please read the Overview Guide 
 (ICD-10_Prod_Overview_Guide_Groups_5_6_7.pdf)posted on the 
 Anonymous directory for installation order. This is critical for 
 proper functionality of the ICD-10 Software.
  
 This patch is part of the Computerized Patient Records System CPRSv30 
 project. This project will modify the Computerized Patient Record 
 System, Text Integration Utilities, Consults, Health Summary, Problem 
 List, Clinical Reminders, and Order Entry/Results Reporting to meet 
 the requirements proposed by the Dept. of Health and Human Services 
 to adopt ICD-10 code set standards Clinic Orders.
  
 On January 16, 2009, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 
 released a final rule for replacing the 30-year-old ICD-9-CM code set 
 with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical 
 Modification (ICD-10-CM) and International Classification of Diseases, 
 Tenth Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) with dates of 
 service, or date of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or after the
 industry activation date. The classification system consists of more than 
 68,000 codes, compared to approximately 13,000 ICD-9-CM codes. There are 
 nearly 87,000 ICD-10-PCS codes, while ICD-9-CM has nearly 3,800 procedure
 codes. Both systems also expand the number of characters allotted from
 five and four respectively to seven alpha-numeric characters.  This value 
 does not include the decimal point, which follows the third character for 
 the ICD-10-CM code set.  There is no decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code 
 set.  These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of 
 care, so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better 
 understand complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and 
 better track the outcomes of care.  ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater 
 specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical 
 decision making and outcomes research.  
   
 NOTE: Functionality specific to activation of the ICD-10 code set shall 
 not be seen by end users until the code set has been activated.
