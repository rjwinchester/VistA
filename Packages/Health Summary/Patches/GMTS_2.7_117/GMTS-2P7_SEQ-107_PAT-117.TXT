Subject: Remove Collaborative Stage + Other Updates For ONC Remote Data View

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains enhancements that extend and improve the functionality
 of the VistA Health Summary package.  The purpose of this release is to update
 the functionality as described below.
 
 1. Update of the Health Summary ONC Remote Data View
 The ONC Remote Data View in Health Summary was outdated and needed several
 updates, additions and deletions.  The changes are listed below:
 
 a) The Collaborative Staging section was removed from the Health Summary ONC
 Remote Data View.  This was required due to the display of old/outdated AJCC
 6th Edition fields and also, since Collaborative Staging of Malignant Tumor
 TNM values will be retired with 2016 and later cases, these obsolete fields
 needed to be removed from the displays anyway.
 
 b) The Date of First Contact (#165.5, #155) and Laterality (#165.5, #28)
 fields were added to the display in the Cancer Identification section.
 
 c) The following fields were added to the First Course of Treatment section:
 Surgery of Primary Site @FAC (#165.5, #50.3)
 Surgery of Other Site (#165.5, #139.2)
 Surg of Other Site @FAC (#165.5, #139.3)
 METS Site Resected (#165.5, #139.6)
 Radiation @FAC (#165.5, #51.4)
 Chemotherapy @FAC (#165.5, #53.3)
 Hormone Therapy @FAC (#165.5, #54.3)
 Immunotherapy @FAC (#165.5, #55.3)
 HEMA Trans/Endocrine @FAC (#165.5, #153.2)
 Other Treatment @FAC (#165.5, #57.3)
 Palliative Care @FAC (#165.5, #13)
 
 d) The following fields were added under the Subsequent Course of Treatment
 section:
 Scope of LN Surgery (#165.51, #35)
 Surgical Proc/Other Site (#165.51, #36)
 METS Site Resected (#165.51, #40)
 
 e) The Date Last Contact (#165.5, #200) field was added to the end of
 the display.
