Associated patches: (v)GMTS*2.7*100<<= must be installed BEFORE `GMTS*2.7*120'

Subject: MRT2 UPDATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Currently, on the Medication Worksheet (aka, Medication Reconciliation 
 Tool #2 (MRT2)), non-VA medications do not display in the same way as VA 
 prescribed medications.
  
 This patch will remove the inconsistencies in the display on the 
 patient-facing report generated from Health Summary data and given to a 
 patient when admitted, discharged or transferred. Per the Joint 
 Commission's NPSG.03.06.01, a medication summary must be given to a 
 patient upon each admission, discharge or transfer. The document used 
 currently does not display non-VA medication information as thoroughly as 
 it does VA medications.
  
 One of the challenges is that Non-VA medication orders are not required 
 to have all the same fields as a VA prescribed medication. However, this 
 enhancement does not address that particular item.
  
 Even when all information is available, the MRT2 report doesn't present 
 the Non-VA meds consistently, and, in fact, there is no 'worksheet space' 
 available for the non-VA medications. Those are the items addressed by 
 this patch.

 Backout/Rollback Strategy:
 --------------------------
 In the event of a catastrophic failure, the Facility CIO may make the 
 decision to back-out the patch.
  
 It is imperative that you have performed a backup of the routine included 
 in this patch prior to installation.
  
 The back-out plan is to restore the routine from the backup created.
  
 No data was modified by this patch installation and, therefore, no 
 rollback strategy is required.
  
 To verify the back-out completed successfully, ensure the checksum 
 matches the pre-patch checksum from the patch descriptions.
