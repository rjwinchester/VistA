 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1.   INC000000601000 - PCE HEALTH FACTOR COMPONET ISSUE
  
      Problem:
      --------
      Health summary for health factor says "visit date" but is displaying 
      either the event date or the visit date.
     
      Resolution:
      -----------
      Modify the program to have the column header read "Event/Visit Date"
      located at HDR+3^GMTSPXFP.
  
 2.   INC000000892660 - Health Summary - Other:
  
      Problem:
      --------
      The Health Summary report for the component CON-MAS Contact is reporting
      the incorrect work phone number for the patient.
  
      Resolution:
      -----------
      The work phone number can be fixed in section WORK ^GMTSMHCI by doing a 
      call to OPD^VADPT to get the correct work phone number.
  
 3.   INC000000856093 - 6 OERR - Reports Tab:
  
      Problem:
      --------
      The Health Summary report for the component SNSR is not listing all
      CPT code for selection.
  
      Resolution:
      -----------
      The Health Summary report selection of the CPT codes will be resolved by
      a program modification to ^GMTSADH5.  Allowing file 81- the CPT code 
      file- to go against the "BA" indexed file will render codes for selection.
