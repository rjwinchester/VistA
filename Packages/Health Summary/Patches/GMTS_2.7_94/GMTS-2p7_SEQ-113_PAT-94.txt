Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to correct a series of issues reported 
 with the Medication Reconciliation Tool #1.
  
 This patch also creates a replica of this called Medication Reconciliation
 No Glossary Tool #1. When the end user selects the Essential Med List For
 Review option, it will generate similar report data but without the
 glossary at the end.
  
 This patch is part of a multi-package build that contains the following 
 two patches:
     GMTS*2.7*94
     PSO*7.0*314

 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 -----------------------------
 PSPO #1262 - Medications from remote VA data missing from Medication 
 Reconciliation profile
 PSPO #1861 - The CPRS Medication Reconciliation Report omits Inpatient 
 Meds for Outpatient (IMO) IV orders with a schedule type of "On Call"
 PSPO #1922 - Med Recon "Remote Data Object" active medications displaying 
 incomplete prescription information from DoD - private pharmacy 
 prescriptions retrieval
 PSPO #2376 - Med Recon omits some expired medications
 PSPO #2570 - Medication Reconciliation Health summary does not provide an 
 inclusive list of all Expired/Discontinued medications from the last year
 PSPO #2605 - several instances whereby the Medication Reconciliation 
 Health Summary (from the CPRS Reports tab) printed/displayed erroneous 
 prescription directions (SIG) for 'Pending' outpatient prescriptions
  
 Defect Tracking System Ticket(s) & Overview:
 --------------------------------------------
  
 1.  INC  290787 - Meds held from remote VA data are not being pulled in
                   med reconciliation profile.
     INC 1241749 - Health Summary - Other
  
 Problem:
 -------
 There was no (local) Inpatient order for simvastatin, but there was a 
 remote Outpatient order that the clinical pharmacist using the report 
 couldn't see. This was due to the fact the remote medication was on hold.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Usage of data from other VA pharmacies via Remote Data Interoperability 
 (RDI) updated to include prescriptions where the status is 'HOLD'.
  
 2.  INC 296479 - Med Recon Tool #1 sometimes missing BCMA data
  
 Problem:
 -------
 In some cases, the BCMA last action is not reported for all items, 
 particularly large volume IVs. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The issue was caused due to the structure of the code that was retrieving
 order text information. For any order without certain order text, the 
 processing would stop before retrieving the BCMA last action. The code has
 been restructured to prevent this.
  
 3.  INC 297716 - Medication Reconciliation Report
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Clinic Medications have no indication that they are clinic meds. They 
 appear with 'INPT' as the service.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 A new Application Programming Interface (API) has been provided to allow 
 the tool to determine if an order is a Clinic Medication. The clinic 
 medications will now display 'CLIN', rather than 'INPT'.
  
 4.  INC  297723 - Most recent order not showing on med reconciliation 
                   report
     INC  300608 - Wrong release date shown in med reconciliation tool #1
     INC  314592 - Medication reconciliation summary not working as
                   expected
     INC  347375 - Medication missing from Med Rec HS
     INC  439391 - Tool #1 Medication Reconciliation Profile - medication 
                   not displaying
     INC  528436 - Drugs displayed wrong on Meds tab
     INC  812381 - Outpatient Pharmacy - Medication Reconciliation issue
     INC 1001674 - Health Summary Medication Reconciliation Class I not 
                   pulling all the data into this reports which is
                   additionally affecting our local reports which depends
                   on it.
     INC 1000262 - Med Rec not displaying correct medication order
  
 Problem:
 -------
 There were two orders for the same medication but the one that displayed 
 on the report was the older of the two.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The program has been revised to look at the correct date field on the 
 prescriptions and no longer infer that the latest expiration date implied 
 the latest prescription.
  
 5.  INC 413004 - Med Reconciliation Awkward for Provider Comments
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Provider comments that contained multiple lines were not printing 
 correctly.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The tool was modified to display multiple line provider comments in a 
 more readable fashion. 
  
 6.  INC 432276 - Remote Meds Object and DoD Meds
     INC 620679 - RDIM pulls up old info which is still listed as active
     INC 831528 - Old DoD order on med rec health summary
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The issue is caused due to the fact that the Clinical/Health Data 
 Repository (CHDR) has no update that marks Department of Defense (DoD) 
 prescriptions have expired.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The program was updated to assume that DoD prescriptions with an issue 
 date more than 1 year in the past must be, by definition, now expired or 
 discontinued and will no longer be considered 'ACTIVE' even though that 
 is precisely what is returned by the CHDR data.
  
 7.  INC  469644 - Medication Reconciliation Component
     INC 1019113 - Medication Reconciliation displaying wrong Sig for
                   medication
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The section of the report that showed 'Other medications previously 
 dispensed in the last year' was misleading. For example, prescriptions 
 with no refills that were over 120 days old would not display at all. In 
 some cases, this led to the belief that the Sig that was displaying was 
 incorrect.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The section in question has been removed from the report and the 
 medications needed for the report were incorporated into the main body of 
 the report.
  
 8.  INC 616298 - IV Order with OC set does not show on Med Recon report
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Whenever an IV order was set to On Call (not the schedule On Call), then 
 the order no longer appeared on the Medication Reconciliation Report.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 System was modified to recognize the On Call property flag for IV types 
 of admixtures.
