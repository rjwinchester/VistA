The canonical list of these files are stored on panorama.osehra.org CACHE
instance.

To produce this list, you need to update the files via Fileman, open Panorama
and browser to the Database administration module, and copy the output of the
messages from the console, massage them to only contain the contents of the
message in the JSON object, and pretty it up by sending it through python -m
json.tool.

This is UGLY!
