Progress Notes has a variable pointer, DXLS, file 121,
field 30 that is as follows:
FILE    ORDER   PREFIX  LAYGO   MESSAGE
80      1      I       n       ICD9 Code
627.5    2      D       n       DSM-III-R Code This is for use with
Mental Health v4.18 and Mental Health v5.0.

With the release of Mental Heath v5.01 this will be changed to:
FILE    ORDER   PREFIX  LAYGO   MESSAGE
80      1      I       n       ICD9 Code
627.7    2      D       n       DSM-IV

PNs should have had an agreement to use this file.  Prior to the release of
Progress Notes v2.5 this data was a part of the Mental Health progress notes
global 606.  The agreement was somehow overlooked when the data was converted
to ^GMR(121.

GMRP*2.5*26 will make Progress Notes fully compatible with versions 4.18, 5.0
and 5.01 of Mental Health.

Progress Notes rtns ^GMRPNP3 and ^GMRPNP4 have been modified to check for the
existence of all 3 possible globals and accomplish the prting accordingly.

While trying to determine what impact ICD10 changes will have
on the active DBIA ICR #1068, it was discovered that the Progress Note package
no longer uses this ICR.

From: Trost, Debbie The following is from the message string discussing this:
I have retired the DBIA #1068.   That sure made it easier Robert!

Thanks Margy!

Debbie, does that mean this ICR needs to be retired, or another status that
would be appropriate?

Please advise.thx!

Rob

Thank you for letting us know.  TIU no longer has routines GMRPNP3 or GMRPNP4
nor does it use file 121 any longer.  We no longer need that ICR.  Thanks
again, Margy

Hi Margy,

I am the primary developer on the ICD10 remediation project for the mental
health package and am seeking ICR concurrence on IA1068 which we want to
update the verbiage on (see below in Yellow) mainly in reference to some new
functionality for the DSM table which is what the IA is for (Mental Health is
the custodial package and TIU is the subscribing package for the DSM table).
I was given your name, along with the names of Ty Phelps and Joel Russell, as
points of contact for TIU to ask about this.  Ty indicated you may be the best
one to ask for feedback.

Here is the IA along with the updates we are proposing:

1068     NAME: DBIA1068
CUSTODIAL PACKAGE: MENTAL HEALTH                              Dallas

FILE: 627.7                  ROOT: YSD
DESCRIPTION:                        TYPE: File
Progress Notes has a variable pointer, DXLS, file 121, field 30 that is as
follows:

Mental Health v4.18 and Mental Health v5.0.

With the release of Mental Heath v5.01 this will be changed to:
FILE    ORDER   PREFIX  LAYGO   MESSAGE
80      1      I       n       ICD Code

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

627.7    2      D       n       DSM-IV

PNs should have had an agreement to use this file.  Prior to the release
of Progress Notes v2.5 this data was a part of the Mental Health progress
notes global 606.  The agreement was somehow overlooked when the data was
converted to ^GMR(121.

GMRP*2.5*26 will make Progress Notes fully compatible with versions 4.18,
5.0 and 5.01 of Mental Health.

Progress Notes rtns ^GMRPNP3 and ^GMRPNP4 have been modified to check for
the existence of all 3 possible globals and accomplish the prting
accordingly.

Please note that Mental Health has made modifications to its YSDIAGE menu
option to check the 0;8 field of file 627.7 and, if it is '9' which denotes
ICD9 ICD VERSION then some date validation logic will be triggered to make
certain that the DATE/TIME OF DIAGNOSIS field in file 627.8 is before the
ICD10 implementation date.  Similarly, if 0;8 of file 627.7 is '10' which
denotes ICD10 ICD VERSION then the DATE/TIME OF DIAGNOSIS field of file
627.8 will be checked to ascertain that it is on or after the ICD10
Implementation date.  TIU should probably add some validation logic in
its routines to emulate what has been done in Mental Health routines for
the YSDIAGE menu option.
